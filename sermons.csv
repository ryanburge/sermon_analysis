Sermon,Name,Location,Date,
"We have begun this year looking at the theme of discipleship.  We have defined discipleship as becoming like Christ, the process that we commit ourselves to and that the Holy Spirit does in our own lives to make us like Christ.  A couple of weeks ago we looked at growing up like Christ.  We saw that Jesus, Himself, grew up in wisdom, in stature and in favor with God and man and that we are called to grow up in these same ways physically, emotionally, spiritually and socially. 

       Last week we talked about becoming like Christ in His ministry.  Jesus took a group of 12, and then later larger groups of people, and they watched Him go about His ministry.  They heard Him teach, they watched Him interact with people, and then He called and He said, “you go and do the same thing.”   We saw a model for the way that we are called to go about being like Christ in His ministry.  

       This week we are going to be looking at becoming like Christ in His suffering.  Last week I began my sermon by talking about how sometimes a preacher must preach beyond himself and “ditto” this week.  The call to become like Christ in His suffering is something that I know that I resist, that I back away from, that I’m scared of.  This sermon is a call and a challenge to all of us.  

       I do want to say something.  We are going to talk a little bit later about the difference between guilt and conviction.  Here at the very beginning I just want to say that for a lot of you, when we talk about suffering, a lot of you are already suffering.  You are suffering physically or emotionally.  There are things going on in your life and now the pastor is going to say, “well, you’re just not suffering quite enough.  You just need to suffer a little bit more!”  That’s not what I’m saying today.  If you are here today and you feel like you have been beat up in one way or another, first of all, I trust that you would pray for all of us as this sermon goes on, that we would hear God’s challenge for us.  Also, to hear today that in your suffering to know that Jesus went before you in it.  He is the pioneer, the author and the perfector of our faith.  He has experienced suffering.  He is familiar and acquainted with suffering and grief.  He has gone before you in it.

       Whatever the case may be for you—and we will talk a little bit later about and conviction—don’t allow this to kind of be a sermon where there is this heaping guilt upon our shoulders.  This is not of the Spirit and we will talk later about conviction from the Spirit and how we can discern between those things.  Would you pray with me as we jump in.

       “Lord, we do thank you that you have gone before us in suffering and I thank you, Lord, that you have given us, by your Spirit, the ability to suffer for our faith.  I pray that you will strengthen us and that you will give us the ability to do that.  Lord, I pray that we would commit ourselves and be willing, Lord, to suffer for your sake.  In Jesus’ name, Amen.”

       Turn to Philippians Chapter 2, verses 12-13.  This begins with the word “therefore.”  As one of my Bible teachers would say, “if you see a “therefore” you have to ask, “what’s the therefore there for?”  Right before that is the Christ hymn of the Philippians.  Paul has said that your attitude should be the same as that of Jesus Christ, who being in very nature God became obedient to death, humbled Himself, became like a servant.  Our attitude is to be like that.  We are to become like Christ, is what Paul says in Philippians 2:1-11, and as He gives us that beautiful hymn of Christ and His work in our life.  Then he says “therefore, because your attitude is to be like Christ, because you are to become like Him, therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence but now much more in my absence, continue to work out your salvation with fear and with trembling.  For it is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose.”  Continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose.  

       We, as Protestants, have emphasized—and rightly so—the grace of God, that we are accepted by God only by His grace.  There is nothing that we can do to merit His favor, to merit His love, to merit His salvation.  Anytime we hear this idea of works we get nervous.  We shouldn’t do that!  Philippians Chapter 2:  “Continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to His good purpose.”  Our salvation, our becoming like Christ, is something we must commit to, and intend to, and work out with fear and with trembling.  Later, Paul is going to say, “I beat my body and I make it my slave in order that I might receive the prize that God has given to me.”  Our work and God’s work are not opposed to one another.  In the Scriptures they come together and God, through His Spirit, uses our work and our effort to make us more like Christ.  Jesus used many parables about farming and agriculture.  We see in the work of a farmer the way that the work of a farmer and the grace of God come together to make a harvest, right?  

       One of my favorite authors is Wendell Berry.  He is a poet and writes fiction as well as non-fiction.  He is a great cultural critic.  He has this poem, and I am going to try to recite some of it for you if I can remember it.  Wendell Berry, by the way, is a Kentucky farmer and feels like he has been called by God to do this.  He says this:  “Harvest will fill the barn and for that our hands must ache and our face must sweat.  And yet, no leaf or grain is filled by work of ours.  The field is tilled and left to grace.  So that we may reap, great work is done while we’re asleep.”  Once the farmer puts that seed in the ground, there is nothing really that the farmer can do to make that seed germinate and grow.  It is grace.  But we also know that in order for that field to bear a harvest, the farmer’s hand has to ache.  His face has to sweat in order to see the fruit.  It is the work of the farmer and the work of God’s grace in His creation that come together to make this harvest.

       The same is true of our spiritual life.  We see in Jesus’ own life that He modeled certain practices—certain work in His own life—in order for Him to grow up in His own walk with His Father.  

       Turn to Hebrews Chapter 5.  We have an amazing word about Jesus’ own growth in obedience here.  I am going to read verses 7 and 8.  The writer of Hebrews says this:  “During the days of Jesus’ life on earth, He offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the One who could save Him from death and He was heard because of his reverent submission.  Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from what He suffered.”  Jesus learned obedience from what He suffered.

       I want to suggest to you that this is even before the cross.  Jesus was born into poverty.  There was no middle-class in Israel at that time.  You were either the king or the religious leaders, or you were kind of everyone else.  Jesus, Himself, knew hunger.  In His own ministry we see He did not have a place to lay His head.  We serve and follow a homeless man.  Jesus was rejected by His family.  We see how His brothers thought He was crazy.  They tried to come to Him and say, “Jesus, you are crazy, get out of here.  They are going to kill you.”  They rejected Him and His ministry.  He was threatened by the most powerful people in the world in His day.  He was betrayed by one of His very closest friends.  Through all of this, Hebrews says that Jesus learned obedience through all of that suffering.  All of it was training and preparation for the cross.  It was all training and preparation so that on that night in the Garden of Gethsemane, on His knees, that He would know that His Father could be trusted.  We see in Jesus’ life how He responded to suffering.  

       The first point I want to make is that Jesus rested in His relationship with His Father.  He is a good, good Father.  Jesus learned that His Father could be trusted, that His Father was in control.  Jesus cultivated this life with His Father where He knew, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that no matter what happened to Him, what other physical suffering He may go through, whoever may reject Him, that He was received and loved by His Father.  This is my Son, the one in whom I am well pleased.  Jesus stood there in that identity.  John Chapter 2 says that Jesus didn’t trust other men.  He didn’t entrust Himself to people because He knew that we are fickle; that we are satisfied with filled bellies and once our bellies aren’t full anymore, we will just go someplace else.  This is what Jesus saw happen all the time in His ministry.  There is a man who is doing great miracles, a man who can fill our bellies—we will follow Him, but when He doesn’t offer that anymore or when He says things like, “You must take up your cross and die and follow me,” that’s when the crowds got a lot smaller.  Jesus knew what was in a man.  He did not entrust Himself to people.  He entrusted Himself to His Father.  He knew that no matter who rejected Him that He had his identity as the Son of the Father.  He knew where He stood. 

       Secondly, we see that Jesus forgave and prayed for his enemies.  No doubt in our lives, we experience suffering at the hands and at the words of other people.  That happened to Jesus over and over and over again.  We see this great example of Jesus while those nails are being pounded into his wrists and He hung on that cross, Jesus looked to them and then He looked to the Father and He said what?  “Forgive them.  They do not know what they are doing.”  Jesus forgave and prayed for His enemies.  That’s how He responded to His suffering.  

       The third thing we see Jesus do is He focused on the joy that was set before Him.  Turn to Hebrews Chapter 12, verses 2 and 3.  The writer of Hebrews says, “Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfector of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.  Consider Him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.”  Jesus knew that this life was not all that there was.  He knew that through His suffering there was something far greater waiting for Him and for all of us as He endured that suffering.  Jesus focused on the joy that was set before Him.  

       We are called to become like Christ in His sufferings.  I want to suggest to you today that in some ways, because we live in such an affluent culture, we really don’t know, in many ways, what it means to suffer, at least like Jesus did and those did in His time.  In many ways we have to practice suffering.  Does that sound weird to you?  It sounds weird to me.  I think that we see this modeled in Jesus’ life.  We hear it in the words of Paul that in some ways we are called to practice suffering—to prepare ourselves to face trials.  

       I am concerned for us.  I know that many of us believe that it’s very possible that very soon that we will face physical, direct persecution and opposition because of our faith.  I am concerned for us that we will not be prepared for it.  We have been well-trained in the ways of comfort, safety and security—very well trained.  We know where to get our comfort and we have access to our comfort.  We are very well resourced in comfort and safety and security.  We are very good at avoiding any hint of pain.  

       At 3:00 I get a little bit hungry.  I get a snack.  We have a hard day at work and we know that it would be better for us to pray about those things—even for five minutes—but we medicate ourselves with television and entertainment instead.  Pastoral counseling is often helping people to feel comfortable and good in their sin and their addiction, rather than calling them to work through that pain and get beyond it to see the real healing that God wants to do in our lives.  Our culture has trained us very well in the practices of comfort and safety and security.  So I am concerned for us.  I am concerned for us that we will not be able to stand in the moment of trial because we have been shaped, formed, and trained in these ways.  

       There are three practices that I want to suggest for us to consider in a way for us to practice suffering.  I want to say that you do not need to feel guilty because you have a roof over your head and food in your refrigerator.  There is no need to feel guilty about that.  What we do need to remember is that these things are given to us not so that we can sit back and be more comfortable in them, but they offer opportunities for us to go deeper into Christ—to spend time not just subsistence living but to spend time in Christ and growing in Him.  These are gifts to us, not to lead us to more comfort but to lead us more deeply into Christ.  

       There are three practices I would like for us to consider.  The first is 1) solitude, 2) forgiving and praying for our enemies, 3) fasting.  I want to talk a little bit first about this whole guilt-thing.  The last thing that I want to do as a pastor is to heap unnecessary burdens on your shoulders.  This is the words that Jesus said to the Pharisees:  “You heap burdens on men’s shoulders and do nothing to help them lift them.”  I do not want to do that to you.  Instead, what I want to do is teach you about the difference between guilt and conviction.  Guilt and conviction.  These two things are very similar and often they feel the same way.  In fact, I think oftentimes they can come at the exact same time.  The question is how do we respond to that feeling of, “there is something in me that’s not quite right.”  What guilt does is that it turns our face to hell.  What guilt does is it makes us hide in shame.  What conviction does is it calls us to go to the cross and it calls us to look up and be open to the One who has already received us.  Guilt makes us heap burdens on our shoulders that allow us to hear the word of the enemy who will say, “you are not worthy because you are not good enough.”  The Spirit’s conviction says, “you are my son.  You are my daughter and I want to give you every good thing you need to live in the way that I am calling you to live.”  Guilt turns our head and our face downward.  Conviction turns it upward to the One who wants to make us whole.  

       In Philippians Chapter 3, verses 10-16, Paul gives us a great model for this balance or this understanding of walking in conviction and not in guilt.  Paul says, “I want to know Christ and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in His sufferings, becoming like Him in His death and so somehow to attain to the resurrection from the dead.”  Verse 12:  “Not that I have already obtained all this.”  Paul freely admits that “I am not there yet.”  But he doesn’t feel guilty about it.  He doesn’t allow Satan, then, to say, “Paul, you were a murderer, a thief, the worst of sinners, and because of that Christ wants nothing to do with you.”  Instead, what does he say?  “I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.  I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it, but one thing I do, forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.”  He desires to know and experience Christ-likeness.  He admits that he doesn’t yet fully have it and all of us need to admit that we do not yet fully have it.  But he pushes on to obtain it.  

       There are three ways that I want to suggest to you today about how we can push on to attain Christ-likeness as we practice suffering.  The first is through the discipline or practice of solitude—being alone—myself and God.  I think in our own lives we often need the presence, the words, the praise of other people.  Being in solitude, spending time in solitude alone with God, teaches us that we are not dependent on the opinions and thoughts of other people.  In solitude we learn that we are His children.

       By the way, each of these three points—solitude, forgiving and praying for your enemies and fasting—correspond with how Jesus responded to His suffering.  Jesus rested in His relationship with the Father.  That attitude is cultivated in times of solitude and quiet with God.  If Jesus required and benefited from 40 days of solitude, I think we could benefit from one or two.  Jesus was in more demand than any of us.  

       Two suggestions for this.  1) Take a few minutes every day to go into a room and just be quiet.  Lock the door, sit there against the door and just be quiet with God for a couple of minutes.  2) I would encourage you to, once a year for a day or two, spend time in silence.  This is one of the most valuable spiritual experiences I’ve ever had.  I was invited to spend 48 hours in silence—no words spoken and, to the best that I could, no words spoken to me.  This 48 hours was a time of renewing and refreshing and I left that time better able to listen to other people and to minister to them.  I was able to sit there while someone talked to me and not have a thousand things running through my head about what I need to do next, what I need to say next—whatever it might be.  I was able to sit and rest because I had spent that time in quiet and in solitude.  Solitude is where we learn that we can rest in our relationship with the Father. 

       Forgiving and praying for our enemies.  This was the example of Jesus on the cross.  We do suffer at the hands of others, at the words of others.  This is an important practice for us.  If we are going to be like Jesus in His suffering, we are going to need to learn to forgive those who hurt us intentionally or unintentionally.  This person may be someone who is very close to you in your life, who you know right now that you need to forgive—to bear with, to persevere with.  It may be a politician—our president—who you need to forgive, and the ways that a lot of Christians are responding to those above us right now reflect a lack of forgiveness and grace and mercy.  We need to forgive those who are above us and to pray for them. 

       Fasting.  This is a fun one, right?  We have really trained ourselves to believe that if we don’t have three square meals a day that we are on the verge of starving.  This is just not true.  Fasting reminds us that we do not live on bread alone.  Fasting is one of the ways that we, as Paul says, “beat our body and make it our slave so that we can become slaves of righteousness.”  To know that every single whim, every single little desire doesn’t need to be satisfied.  Fasting trains us not only to be disciplined in our food but disciplined in all other ways—in the areas of lust and where we take our eyes.  It trains our bodies to know that we do not have to satisfy every little inkling that comes our way.  It is a way that we crucify our flesh.  It also helps us to set our mind not on the joy that is before us on our little plate, but the joy that is set before us in heaven.  

       Jesus set his mind and his heart on the joy that was set before him.  We do take such pleasure in food and the comforts of food and the comforts of other worldly things, and we should.  They are gifts from God.  But we must put them in their place in our lives.  They can become idols. 

       Fasting—I would encourage you to start slow—one meal a day.  If you have never done this before, one meal a day, and throughout that time when you certainly are hungry and when your stomach is going to rage against this thing that you are doing to it, in those moments allow God to be the one that you feed on—to feed on His presence and to remind yourself that man does not live by bread alone.  

       Some of you, for health reasons, can’t abstain from food.  Abstain from something else, or perhaps simply just have the very basics—bread and water or maybe some fruit—whatever it would take you to be able to take your medication or whatever it may be.  But commit yourself to abstaining from specific things for a period of time.  

        I just want to say, again, that this solitude and this forgiving and praying for our enemies and this fasting is not to heap burdens on you.  Don’t think that you have to go and apply all of these things by 6:00 p.m. this evening or tomorrow.  Ask the Lord, what is He calling me to?  We pastors are really good at giving you “five things that you need to do this next week or ten things that you need to do this next year,” and all of a sudden we have 150 things that we are supposed to do and we think, “how do I do it all?”  Seek the Lord in it.  What is God calling you to do?  Maybe it is a day or a few minutes or hours of solitude.  Maybe there is a person you need to bear with and choose to forgive.  Maybe it’s something that you need to abstain from—fasting.  Whatever it may be for you.  These are means of God’s grace.  They are not meant to be law, to burden us down, they are gifts given to us to help us to crucify our flesh and to become more like Christ.  We should receive them in that way.

       As you go about discipling other people in your own life, as you have other people in your life that you are helping to grow in Christ-likeness, as you practice these things, pass them on then to other people.  If you have experienced the benefit of fasting, teach someone else how to do that.  If you have experienced the benefit of silence or solitude or whatever spiritual practice it might be, pass those things on as a part of their discipleship.  Again, it’s not only head knowledge that we are trying to get into people’s minds but it’s also practices that form and shape our minds and our hearts and enable us to resist the flesh and to walk in the Spirit.

       Your discipleship includes inviting people and teaching people into certain spiritual practices that will help them to grow up in Christ.  Be aware of that and consider what practices have been beneficial to you.  “God has brought this person to me and so maybe I’m supposed to pass this onto them, too, and teach them to walk in that as well.”  Let’s pray together: 

        “Our God in Heaven, we do confess that we love our comfort and our safety and our full bellies.  We confess that we often love them more than you.  Lord, I pray that you would bring your conviction into our life, your words of hope and change and that draw us to Jesus.  Lord, I pray that you would lead each one of us into very specific practices that you have for me and for each of us that we may listen to you, obey you, and respond.  As we commit to those things we know that you will be faithful, by Your Spirit, to make us more like Christ.  Amen.”
",Ryan D. Cochran,"Fort Wayne, IN",1/17/2016,
"On Resurrection Sunday morning, we invited you to write your short testimony, “I once was_____, but now I am______.”  I want to read a few more of those again this morning.  We had about 200 people who came forward and laid these brief testimonies here at the foot of the cross.  Some said this, “I once was suicidal but now I know who I live for—Jesus Christ, my Savior.  I once was living in self-hatred but now I am living in self-acceptance and joy because I know who I am in Christ.  I once was dead in gossip, lying, fear, anxiety and hatred, but now I am free and alive in Christ and no longer bound to my sin.  I once was longing to be loved but now I am loved and cherished by the King of King and Lord of Lords.  I was once in a void, wandering with no foundation, but now I am grounded in Him and full of joy for His abiding, everlasting grace.  I once was a person with no value but now I am one that God has given great value.  Amen.”

       “Lord, we thank you for each and every testimony in this room.  We thank you for these words that remind us of the work that you are doing.  God, we pray that you would speak to us through your Word, that you would challenge us, and that you again would meet us where we are, and that you would make us more like Christ.  In Jesus’ name.  Amen.”  

       Have you ever had that experience where you just miss out on something that everyone else got to experience?  My wife had one of those experiences a few years ago.  We were at a Detroit Tigers baseball game.  You know, the score can be 1 to nothing and I’m just glad to be at a baseball game, but that’s not actually the case for everybody.  It had been kind-of a slower game.  It was, I think, 3 to 1.  The bad guys were winning and it was the 8th inning.  I think Gloria was just a year or so old and Katie had to take Gloria to get a diaper change.  Detroit got a hit, and then a walk, and then a homerun.  It was a slow game and Katie was out doing something else, and I imagine she could hear all the cheers.  She missed it!  

Believing and Doubting

       We have a story today about someone who missed out on something.  John Chapter 20, starting in verse 24:  “Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the Twelve, was not with the disciples when Jesus came.  So the other disciples told him, ‘We have seen the Lord!’  But he said to them, ‘Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.’  A week later his disciples were in the house again and Thomas was with them.  Though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, ‘Peace be with you!’  Then he said to Thomas, ‘Put your finger here; see my hands.  Reach out your hand and put it into my side.  Stop doubting and believe.’  Thomas said to him, ‘My Lord and my God!’  Then Jesus told him, ‘Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.’  Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples which are not recorded in this book, but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.’”

       In our sermon last week, we heard of Jesus’ appearance to His disciples on Resurrection Sunday evening.  They were in the Upper Room, the doors were locked, and Jesus appeared to them.  “Peace be with you,” and He showed them His hands and His side and, of course, they were overjoyed when they saw the Lord; but Thomas was missing!  We don’t know where he was.  Maybe he was out for a walk, thinking about all of the events of the day.  He has heard Mary Magdalene who has come and said, “the tomb is empty and I’ve seen Jesus there in the garden.”  Maybe he was out getting bread for dinner.  We don’t know why he wasn’t there, but he wasn’t there and he missed it. Can you imagine what that must have been like for Thomas.   All of the events over the course of that week--watching his Lord be arrested and hung up on a cross, and then watching Him die, and then having the agony of Friday night and Saturday.  Then all day Sunday, this confusion about things that are going on, and now all of his friends—these ones who he has walked with the last few years--have all had this experience of seeing Jesus, at least so they say!  But Thomas wasn’t there.  He missed it.  So he doubts.  Thomas’ response to them has become famous:  “Unless I touch the nail marks in his hands and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.”  Thomas’ words, here, are very forceful.  It’s not just, “I want to touch his side.”  It’s like he is saying, “Unless I shove my hand into his side, I’m not going to believe it.”

       Thomas has become known as “Doubting Thomas.”  He does doubt, but later, after he sees Jesus, he gives the most complete confession of anyone in any of the gospels.  “My Lord and My God!”  John uses this story of Thomas to illustrate what his goal was of his entire gospel.  I read John’s thesis statement of his entire gospel:  “Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples which are not recorded in this book, but these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.”  Thomas is the final illustration of those who believe and what a confession in Jesus sounds like.  “My Lord and my God!”  

Thomas and His Doubting

       So why was it that Jesus chose to show up at a time when Thomas wasn’t there?  It doesn’t really seem fair in some ways.  It seems almost a little bit cruel, that Thomas would be the only one for a week who would live in doubt and despair, wondering if maybe his friends had gone crazy, doubting, hoping for hope, just, “did this really happen?”  Why did Jesus decide to show up when Thomas wasn’t there?  Jesus could have waited another hour until Thomas showed up.  He surely knew that Thomas wasn’t there.  

       God’s design was to show us a man, one of the disciples, who was very much like us; a man who was very prone to doubt and to be skeptical, but a man who was also able to give a great confession.  Isn’t that like you?  I know it’s like me.  A man who daily, it seems, has doubts, and yet the same man who is able to boldly proclaim Jesus Christ is Lord of my life!  Am I the only one?  I didn’t think so.  

       In my own experience in the church, I have never really been very comfortable saying what I just said, expressing my own doubts.  As a pastor, sometimes I wonder if you all really knew what went on in my head, if you would be setting up a Search Committee pretty soon!  It seems to me that in the church we are very threatened by doubt, threatened by the idea of doubt when it comes our way, or threatened by the idea of doubt when we see it or hear it in a brother or sister.  Very often we tell one another-- sometimes in maybe subtle ways and maybe other times in very overt ways--that doubt is this great enemy and it should be avoided at all costs!  We think that doubt is always a sign of weak faith; that doubt is always a sign that maybe you’re not quite walking with Jesus as you should; that doubt may even be a sign of some kind of deep sin in your life; that if you have questions, you know we really shouldn’t ask those questions, and that the strength of our faith is often judged by how certain we are in our minds and how few questions we ask--that the strength of our faith is often judged by how certain we are and how few questions we have. 

       Quite frankly, I find this strange for a group of people that has the Book of Psalms right in the middle of their Bible.  The Psalms are primarily a book of prayers written to God; prayers written by His people that express the inner life and the inner thoughts of His people.  This is written by people of faith!  Prayers expressed to God, and what questions dominate the Psalms?  “God, why have you forgotten me?  God, why do my enemies seem to triumph over me?  God, are you there?”  In the Psalms, we as believers are given examples of prayer.  In those examples of prayer, there is question after question, doubt after doubt, being expressed in brutal honesty to God.  I have read the Psalms more than any other book in the Bible.  I bring them up constantly in my pastoral counseling.  The primary characteristic of the Psalms is not certainty, but honesty.  The primary characteristic of the prayers of the Psalms is not certainty, it is honesty.  The Psalms are honest with feelings of pain, honest with feelings of loneliness and isolation, honest with feelings of hopelessness and lack of certainty.  Honesty with ourselves and with God is, in my reading, is one of the primary characteristics of the Psalm writers.  It seems to me that sometimes we actually encourage one another to be dishonest with ourselves and with God.  “Don’t ask those questions!  Don’t feel that way!  It makes me feel uncomfortable about my faith. You are doubting.  Maybe there is sin in your life.”

       The act of faith in the Psalms is not that there will always be certainty in our life of faith.  The act of faith in the Psalms is coming to God in those doubts, in those hurts.  In our anger and our frustration. and our doubts about God, the Psalms teach us how to have doubts, how to have fears and still to be in relationship with God in the midst of them.  The life of the believer is characterized by certainty and doubt, which is why the Psalms have plenty of prayers with both of them in them!  Prayers of certainty:  “You are my God!  I will triumph over my enemies.  You are my Shepherd, I shall not be in want!”  And also doubts:  “Day and night I lay on my bed in tears.  Where are you God?  My bones are in agony.  My enemies seem to win over and over again.  Where are you?  God, have you forgotten me?”  The Psalms tell us how to live as believers in both seasons of great certainty as well as seasons of doubt.   

       I heard an illustration this past week that really, I think, resonated with me very well, about our misconception about faith.  We often see faith and belief in the Christian life as having something to do with our own strength.  The illustration that was used described one of those “strength meters” that you see at a carnival.  You have the guy who takes the mallet and bangs it really hard and however strong the person is, that’s how far the ball goes up and rings the bell.  Isn’t that kind of how we think about our faith?  However strong we are, however strong we can wield that mallet of faith, that’s how strong our faith is!  We judge our faith by how strong we are.  

       I want to say to you this morning that it’s better for you—it’s better for all of us—to doubt out loud, to yourself and to God, to your fellow brothers and sisters, than it is to ignore your doubt and to pretend that it isn’t there; to pretend that you are swinging that mallet and banging that bell every single day, when you’re not.  What it means to have faith in the Bible has nothing to do with your strength and your certainty and everything to do with how willing you are to trust in God’s strength.  The Psalms suggest that when you come to God and offer him your honest questions, when you offer Him your doubt and your hopelessness, that you are actually exercising greater Biblical faith because you are expressing faith that God can handle it.  In that act of bringing it to God, you are seeking a real relationship with Him; you are wrestling with Him in your pain.  

       One of the earliest stories of God’s identity with His people is the story of Jacob wrestling all night with God, and then Israel receives the name, “one who wrestles with God.”    

       A friend of mine, who I was counseling one day, was sharing with me that in his relationship with his mom for his entire life, he has just really struggled, and they have always been at odds.  Maybe you’re like that with one of your parents—always at odds.  I was trying to figure out what to say to him to help him get along with his mom.  I said, “well, maybe you need to kind-of ignore some of the things that she says or does to you and let it run off like water off a duck’s back.”  He looked at me like I was crazy!  He said, “No!  She’s my mom!”  I realized at that moment that Brian knew something about relationships that I didn’t.  For me, in many ways, relationships are just kind-of like “keeping the peace.”  But for him, relationships often met struggle and wrestling with one another until there was true agreement with one another.   

       Jacob was given the name, Israel, “one who wrestles with God.”  Not one who pretends that everything is okay.  Not one who pretends that there are no doubts.  

       Now, there are a few of you in this room who have no idea what I’m talking about this morning.  There are a few of you in this room who have been given this extra measure of God’s grace.  Paul says in Corinthians that, “some believers are given the spiritual gift of faith.”  Not saving faith—all believers have that kind of faith—but an extra measure of faith where you just know that you know that you know that you know, and there aren’t these doubts that come into your life.  If that’s you, this morning, praise God that He has given you that gift and the rest of us need your words of encouragement and your example of faith.  But I also want you to remember that it’s a gift that God gave to you.  It wasn’t something that you were clever enough to figure out or strong enough to hold.  It’s a gift that God has given to you.  I also want you to remember this morning as you are hearing your pastor be very honest with his own doubts, to remember Jude, verse 22.  It very simple says, “Be merciful to those who doubt.”  I love that!  Be merciful to those who doubt.  

- He was not alone in his doubt (neither are you)

       History has come to call Thomas “Doubting Thomas,” and I want to show here for a moment that he was not alone in his doubt.  Jesus predicted that He would rise from the dead.  The prediction was known by many.  It was so well-known, in fact, that the Romans actually had guards stationed at Jesus’ tomb so that no one could steal the body and then claim later that he had risen from the dead.  So, this prediction was widely known and yet, on Resurrection Sunday morning, the empty tomb was not enough for them to believe.  Mary Magdalene looked at Jesus and thought He was the gardener.  Jesus had to reveal Himself and convince her that He was real.  It says that John looked into the empty tomb and he believed, but he is still there on Sunday evening in fear with the rest of his brothers, wrestling with what’s going on.  All of them heard Jesus say He would rise, but none of them seem to really believe.  All of them doubted in some way.  It’s not only Thomas who was a doubter.  All the disciples were doubters, and in order for them to believe that Jesus actually did what He said He would do, they had to see His nail-pierced hands and his wounded side.  

       So I think that we should let Thomas off the hook a little bit, because we are going to see in a moment that the story of Thomas is not in the Bible because of his doubt, the story of Thomas is in the Bible because of his confession.  He is “Believing Thomas.”  Thomas was not alone in his doubt, and I hope that the other disciples were gracious to Thomas during that entire week of doubt and uncertainty.  I hope that they remembered their own doubt.  

       Thomas was not alone in his doubt and neither are you.  Maybe you look around at other people in the church and you wonder why they can be so certain.  Maybe you feel like Thomas.  It seems like everyone around you is so certain that it seems like they live in a world that is entirely different than you.  They see a world that is black and white and you see a world that is gray.  You are unsure, you are uncertain.  You believe in Jesus, you have placed your faith in Jesus, you have set your feet on the solid rock of Jesus, but you find, like that disciple, “I believe, Lord, help me in my unbelief.”  

       I say to you again this morning, if that is you, it is better for you to doubt out loud than it is to be quiet and to pretend.  The Psalms and the whole Bible invite you to wrestle with God with your questions.  I want to suggest to you that there are some benefits that come from doubt.  You can label this part of the sermon:  “The benefit of the doubt.”  (Ha-ha!)

       The first way I think that doubt benefits us is that it reminds us that we are frail.  It calls us to be humble.  The Bible tells us that we fall short of God’s glory and, certainly, we fall short of God’s glory because of sin, but we fall short of God’s glory because of all kinds of other reasons as well, and one of those is because we are frail; we are dust.  I think that this humility in our faith, the times of seasons of doubt, can help us to help others in their seasons of doubt.  It can help us to walk alongside them.  It helps us to remember, when we are talking to unbelievers, what it’s like to not believe, and how scary that can be sometimes!   How painful it can be to not believe, to wonder if God is real.  

       I have found in my own evangelism that the people I most like to do evangelism with are individuals who are just skeptics.  I have found that one of the most powerful things in that relationship—this isn’t like a strategy or some kind of thing that I do—I like to identify with them in their skepticism.  Instead of coming to them and saying, “you know, I’ve got all the answers here, and why don’t you just kind-of line up and believe in them, too?”  I just tell them all of the ways that I struggle to believe, too.  That’s really where I start with them.  I tell them the different things that I struggle with, the different things that I doubt about, the different things that I don’t believe, and then I tell them, “but I have found One who holds the words of eternal life.  I have found the One who has risen from the dead.  I have found the One who I can trust.”  While all of my other doubts may be real, I stand on that Person and on that work.   

       Doubt can bring humility into our life.  I think that we, as believers, need to have humility as we approach unbelievers or those who are struggling with doubt.  We need to, as Jude says, “be merciful with those who doubt.”

       I Corinthians tells us that even the best of us see through a glass dimly.  Even the very best of us see through this dusty and dirty glass.  Doubt, unanswered questions, uncertainty—all of these things that all of us experience—should remind us that we are dust, that we are frail, that we are finite and limited in our knowledge and that we cannot know fully and completely.  We can know truly, but we cannot know fully and completely.  

       The second benefit of doubt is that it should cause us to pursue the truth.  There is nothing good about simply reveling in or being content in our doubt.  Our doubt and unanswered questions are invitations from God to go deeper into the knowledge of who He is and about His care and His love for you.  There really are these two different kinds of doubt, one kind of doubt that really fears the truth because of the commitment that it will require.  If you find out the truth that God created everything or that Jesus rose from the dead, that demands some kind of commitment and response, right?  I’ve heard that agnostics are just atheists who have a fear of commitment.  It’s this tension—“I don’t want to commit either way.  I don’t want to say there is a God and I don’t want to say there is not a God, so I’ll just kind-of stay in this perpetual state of doubt because it feels safer.”  We do that, too!  Often, as Christians, we are agnostics in all sorts of ways in our life and we don’t commit and aren’t willing to fall off the ladder—right?  We don’t commit ourselves fully to Jesus.

       So there is this kind of doubt that just “sits” and is content with it.  That’s not the kind of doubt that the Psalms talk about.  It’s not the kind of doubt that I am talking about today.  The kind of doubt that I’m talking about today is a doubt that pursues the truth; the kind of doubt that doesn’t come out of fear of the truth but out of love for the truth.  It’s a desire to commit our lives to the truth.  I think that this is the kind of doubter that Thomas was.  “I will not believe unless I see.”  But when he sees, what does he do?  “My Lord and my God!”

- His doubt led to a great confession
       
       Thomas’ doubt eventually ended with a great confession.  “My Lord and my God”  This is the most complete and full confession that anyone gives in the Gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.  Throughout the Gospel of John, Jesus is communicating who He is.  “I am the one sent from the Father.  I and the Father are one.  Anyone who sees me has seen the Father who is in Heaven.”  Here, Thomas is the first one who gets it completely right:  “My Lord and my God.”  Thomas said, “unless I see the nail marks and put my fingers where the nails were and shove my hand into his side, I will not believe.”  Jesus appears to them again and Thomas doesn’t even go touch him.  He lays aside his conditions that he gave and he sees Jesus and the truth and he says, “My Lord and my God.”  This is an incredible confession.  It’s a confession that is not grounded in a fear of commitment.  It is a complete confession.  “You are my Lord.  You are my God.”  It is a confession that speaks about the universal claim that Jesus is Lord and God.  He confesses that that One who is standing there before him with nail-pierced hands and with a scarred side, that that One was present in the beginning.  He confesses that this man who is standing before him, who was walking around with us for the last few years, this same One who hung on a cross, also spoke light and life into the whole world.  

       Thomas’ confession is that He is Lord.  He is God!  But Thomas says he is my Lord and my God.  It is a universal confession but it is very personal as well.  The One standing before him is the Lord over his life.  The One standing there with nail-pierced hands and a scarred side is One who knows him intimately and who died for him.  The One who is standing there is the One to whom Thomas must bow.  “My Lord and my God.” 

       “These things are written so that you might believe and that by believing you may have life in His name.”  John places Thomas’ story right there before he gives his thesis statement for his entire Gospel because Thomas’ confession is what John’s entire gospel was leading up to at that point and it’s the purpose of John’s gospel for your life as well; that in your life that you would say, “My Lord and my God” to Jesus.  

       Thomas’ story of doubt and of skepticism is given for all of you who find yourselves at times to be—or maybe at many times—to be a doubter and a skeptic.  This morning, if you are a person who has questions and doubts, this Book was written to you so that you may believe, and that by believing you may have life in His name.  If you are a doubter and a skeptic, study the life of Thomas and the confession that he makes.  

       Jesus gets the last word in this story.  He says to Thomas, “you have seen and have believed, but blessed are those who have not seen and yet who still believe.”  This is the “Ryan Cochran paraphrase” message version of this verse:  “Blessed are those of you who are not certain;  blessed are those of you who have doubts and questions, but still believe, who still are willing to place your whole weight in the hands of Jesus; who hear the Gospel, the message of the cross over and over again and in spite of all of your doubts and your questions, you hear that story—you see the cross—and you are drawn to it!  You see the story of the greatest love that the world has ever known and you are drawn to it, and you know that you want whatever love was expressed there.  You have doubts and questions about other things, but you are a person who is drawn to Jesus and who He is.”

       The story of Thomas is for you.  Because you can!  And the whole Bible tells us that doubts and uncertainty will be part of your life.  But Jesus wants to lead you to a great confession:  confession that He is your Lord and your God.  So, blessed are you who do not see.  Blessed are you who do have uncertainty and do have doubt, but who still believe and follow and trust in Jesus.  Blessed are you!

       “God in heaven, we thank you that you can be trusted with our doubts.  We thank you that in the words of the Psalms and in the words of your disciples, often, that we are shown that a real relationship with you has seasons of doubt as well as seasons of great certainty.  I pray that in both, that we are people who would wrestle with you; that we would seek a relationship with you, and that in both our certainty as well as in our doubt, that we would know you as our Lord and our God.  Amen.”

"If you waited to take down your Christmas lights until Friday—the
actual day of Epiphany, which was also the day after the Twelfth Day of
Christmas, when your true love gave to you 12 drummers drumming,
you get etiquette bonus points for liturgical decorating.
Maybe you decorate for Christmas just because it’s the thing you do
without thinking. Maybe because the neighbors expect it and you don’t
want to be that guy—like me—whose house and yard look like they
belong to an unbeliever. But if you get inside the rituals of lights and
follow the logic of the Christian year, there’s something more you
discover about yourself in all of it: you are participating in a story about
what you think everything means. You’re finding yourself in that story.
And today I want you to become more conscious of just that.
Epiphany is the season that begins with the wise men from the east who
followed the star in the night sky to see the baby Jesus. So if you think
you’re finished with lights because you’re finished with Christmas, you
would be mistaken. Epiphany is all about light: Jesus is the light of the
world, the Magi follow the light to him; and the whole season attends to
the mission of shining the light of Jesus to everyone and not allowing
him to remain an obscure little babe away in a manger in a dark corner
of the ancient world.
Now the way all this started was for Jesus himself to come to it. From
the babe in the manger, we skip all the way in one week to his baptism
in the Jordan at about age 30. Even Jesus had to accept his identity and
his mission. And we see that happening when he is baptized by John in
order, as he says, to “fulfill all righteousness.”
Now we might pause here to consider why Jesus is baptized at all.
Christians are baptized in Jesus’ name as a way of identifying ourselves
with his saving life and sharing in the grace of it. Our sins are forgiven,
and we may live from then on without fear of death because we live by
faith in the Son of God, who loved us and gave himself for us. But what about Jesus? His baptism lacks the need for repentance and
forgiveness that comes with ours, but his baptism does connect with
something we often neglect about ours. Jesus says he must be baptized
to fulfill all righteousness. That is, he is baptized as a way of submitting
to God’s will for his life. In his baptism, he accepts what he is meant to
do with his life. He’s wading into the river of God’s ever-flowing love.
He’s immersing himself in the current of God’s justice and joy. He’s
taking on the job of being God’s agent of light and life.
We know this because God confirms it in his baptism. You may not catch
this at first, but, hey, that’s why you have a preacher, don’t you know?!
That’s what I’m here for. When the voice from heaven speaks, Matthew
has God quoting God from Isaiah. Listen again to the words of Isaiah:
Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I
have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the
nations. Now listen again to the voice from heaven: This is my Son,
Beloved, with whom I am well pleased. A good paraphrase would be: This
is my beloved Son, in whom my soul delights. He is the one I have chosen to
fulfill the mission of Israel to be a light to the nations.
What Jesus would have heard in that moment was the echo of Isaiah’s
words ringing in his ears. He would have known what that meant for
him. He would have understood his mission.
Jesus understood Isaiah. When he was called upon to read in his
hometown synagogue in Nazareth, he went to the Isaiah scroll, turned to
chapter 61 and read about the Spirit of the Lord being upon him,
anointing him to preach good news to the poor, release to the captives,
sight to the blind, and on and on. The chapters from Isaiah 40 onward
are the so-called Suffering Servant passages. Israel has been in captivity
in Babylon. They have watched the powerful abuse the powerless,
including them. They have heard the Babylonian theology every day,
which claimed thay if you were strong and rich and powerful, God had
blessed you. If you were weak and poor and powerless, God had
determined that, too, because God determines everything and is always
on the side of the winners. This is the theology of every empire.
At this time God was about to deliver Israelites from the Babylonian
empire and return them to Jerusalem. And the question was what kind of people they would become. Would they try to be like their neighbors
and adopt the same cruel theology that caused so much benefit to so few
and so much misery to so many? Or would they be agents of the one
true God, who would have them be a light to the nations? Would they do
the light work that God ordained in a world of darkness? Would they
defend the weak and bring justice to the oppressed? Would they teach
the world to use power only in service of justice and to give hope to all
people?
This is what Jesus understood as he stood in that river with John. He
understood that he himself was Israel. He was the personification of God
in the flesh and the embodiment of Israel in his person. Who he was and
what he was to do were one thing: he was to be the light of the world,
and as such he was to bring light to the nations.
Here we stand at the beginning of a new year, and I have a question for
you. Do you remember your baptism? Do you remember that day the
water poured over you and you felt the love of God saying, You are my
son, or you are my daughter? Do you remember the feeling of being
bound to God in Jesus Christ? Yes, it was a moment of confirmation that
you were forgiven, saved and free. But it was more than that. And the
more than that is why we touch salt to your lips and give you that candle
to carry out of the water with you. It was not only about who you are; it
was about accepting your mission to join Jesus in being a light to the
world. If you belong to the family of God, you have a role to play in the
family business.
Mary Oliver ends her beautiful poem “Summer Day” by asking: Tell me,
what is it you plan to do/with your one wild and precious life?
Too many of us spend our lives seeking a love we already have. We look
for it in our relationships and end up putting too much pressure on
others to make us believe we are loved—when we already are! We look
for it in the admiration we can gain from people who will praise us for
our success and achievements. But all human glory is fleeting. Only the
glory of God is lasting.
Listen to me: your baptism didn’t do something new for you that wasn’t
true before it: you are and always have been beloved in the mind and heart of God. You can’t do anything to make that truer or to change that
eternal fact. What you can do now is to quit looking for it.
It’s like the young guppy who swam up to an old fish and asked, Sir, I
have heard about a thing called the ocean, and I am looking for it. The old
fish simply told him that he could stop looking: he was born in it, he was
swimming in it, and it would always surround him.
The real question is, what we are going to do with our belovedness? We
belong to God through Jesus Christ. Will we accept our mission to be a
light to the nations?
The answer begins, I think, by our doing a searing inventory about the
way we organize our lives. What’s behind our schedule and goals? I
would say that most of us tend to work toward ways to separate
ourselves from others, to make ourselves less dependent on others, to
guard our time and our hearts from being affected by those who would
demand our attention. We want to be secure and self-sufficient. Our
time and energy and money are directed toward our own comfort
rather than to giving comfort to others.
But the whole point of Jesus’ baptism is his identification with us
sinners. He didn’t have to do so. He could have ordered his life the way
we do. But then he would never have shown us the way of salvation,
which always proceeds from love for God and our neighbor. Jesus didn’t
save us individually so that we could protect ourselves from others. He
saved us from our selfish ways so that we could live selflessly instead.
Just last week two prosperity- gospel TV preachers were chatting about
their need to fly on private planes. They were droning on about how
being on a private plane allows them to hear the voice of the Lord
better. One of them declared: Private jets are sanctuaries that protect the
anointed. He went on to say that commercial airline travel was
impossible for preachers in a “dope-filled world” and that riding coach
was like “getting in a long tube with a bunch of demons. Does that sound like Jesus? And yet this is what a lot of people think
about Christianity.
My friend and colleague Charlie Johnson is the executive director of
Pastors for Texas Children, a group that Wilshire and I are associated
with that supports high-quality public education for all. A young woman
recently overheard him talking about Jesus in a local coffee shop. She
approached his table and said without one hint of irony, Excuse me. I
couldn’t help but overhear you. You say you are a Christian, but you sure
don’t sound like one. I’ve listened to you for an hour now talk about
justice, compassion, tolerance, identification with the poor—that’s not
what Christians believe.
Why would she say such a thing? Only because Christians are too often
cut off from the power source of our faith. And when we are, our light
cannot shine in such a way that they can see things clearly.
One reason I don’t put up Christmas lights is because I have suffered
through too many years of tangled wires and random bulbs that burned
out, causing the whole string to be out until I found the culprit. I know
that most Christmas lights are designed in parallel now rather than
series, so that doesn’t happen any more, but please don’t tell Kim.
Whether series or parallel, a circuit of lights can’t work unless it is
connected to a power source. And when it is, the phrase electricians use
for that is completing the circuit. Until you complete the circuit, you only
have potential lights. When you complete the circuit, the lights will glow
because the current can flow from the source to the bulbs.
As you consider your life this year, your goals and resolutions, the first
thing is make sure you are connected to Christ, who is himself the Light
of the World. But when you are, completing the circuit will mean that
you are shining your light for him into all the dark corners of your
world. It’s not enough for you to feel the warm glow of God on the
inside; you are meant to shine.  ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",1/8/2017,
"Something just feels right about going to church on Christmas Day. The
angels singing good news of great joy that shall be to all people, the
shepherds cooing over baby Jesus and then returning to their fields
amazed and glorifying God for all they had seen and heard, the gentle
Jesus, meek and mild, wrapped in swaddling clothes, the star in the sky
looking down where he lay in the hay—my goodness, how much
goodness can we cram into one story? Besides, we get to sing Yea, Lord,
we greet thee, born THIS happy morning, and we don’t have to pretend
it’s Christmas morning when it’s not. We need Christmas Day worship to
top off Christmas Eve worship if we are to do the whole thing justice. So
thanks for coming today.
But having said all that, our Gospel text from John this morning has no
Nativity story. Did you notice? No angels or shepherds or stars or songs.
Luke gives us most of that. Matthew adds a little but omits most of it.
Mark gives us nothing at all, making it seem as if Jesus just appeared
fully grown, like Clint Eastwood in a spaghetti Western riding in from
the desert on a horse to save the day, if not the world. John’s Christmas
story is really a creation story. He’s the last to write a Gospel. He would
have known about Matthew, Mark and Luke, but he wants us to think
about it all from another angle.
John begins at the beginning—the beginning of all things. He doesn’t
want us to think that Jesus appears in the middle of history as an
afterthought or a Plan B. Jesus is not the divine Son of God only because
he was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He is
who he is because he has always been who he is. That is, the child who
was born in Bethlehem is the Word of God through God, who spoke the
world into being. Jesus is not the exception to the rule of how babies are
made; he is the mold and model of what God had in mind from the start
of creation and what God has in mind for the new creation.
In him was life, and the life was the light of all people. Life and light: these
two things amount to all things. Light and life to all he brings, we sing.
This all is a crucial theme of Christmas. Luke gets to the all by naming all 
2
sorts of people who are part of the Christmas pageant of his Gospel. But
John doesn’t name Joseph and Mary, shepherds and angels, or even
Matthew’s wise men. John steps all the way back to the first moment of
creation and says that the meaning of this person may be found in all
things. No one and nothing that was made came into being apart from
the Word of God that finally—on that bleak midwinter night in
Bethlehem—came to be flesh in Jesus.
John’s telling of creation through the Word recalls the first words of
Genesis: In the beginning … . In Genesis God speaks the Word and says,
Let there be light, and there was light. And then the rest of creation is
made over the next six days, culminating in the creation of human
beings. John reverses the order a bit by saying that LIFE came into being
through him and that the life was itself the light of all people. So life and
light or light and
life—whatever the order—are related. Let’s take John’s order and look
deeper.
John is making claims in this first chapter that are nothing short of a
grand unifying theory of everything. Jesus is the eternal Word of God
that becomes flesh. In him is life itself. These are universal claims. Our
Christian faith is connected to the fabric of all reality.
What that means is that if you want to find out something about Christ,
you can look anywhere. Now, the Bible is not to be overlooked in your
looking. The Bible is God’s revelation to us about God’s revelation to us.
with a capital W. The Bible doesn’t point to itself like we so often think,
as if it is the Word incarnate. It points to the Word who became flesh in
Jesus. But it also—as is the case with John here and the writer of
Hebrews and Paul in Colossians and another John in Revelation and
David in the Psalms and Solomon in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes—points
us everywhere else to look for him, too.
What John wants us to see is that there are not two realms of reality to
explore: one, a natural world accessible to science that we can
understand by methods of human inquiry; and two, the supernatural
world, which we can access only by faith, since it is above and beyond
us, as God lives outside of our experience. No, Christmas tells us that
God is for us by being with us—and more than that, that God always has
been with and for us. Jesus only makes clear what has been true since the beginning of time. God is a part of creation, not apart from it. The
eternal God is deeply invested in time.
This universal claim also means that Christianity is not and cannot be a
tribal religion. Whenever we try to turn Christianity into a Western
religion or a white religion, say, we blaspheme the Christ of Christianity.
Christianity may have appeared historically in the first century of the
Common Era, but it is rooted in the Truth of all time and all being.
If the Word became flesh in Jesus, then Jesus belongs to all humans, not
just to Christians. Underneath all religious longing and human
aspiration for God is the Word who prompts it. I am sometimes
misunderstood when I say things such as, God is in the sorting business,
not me. I sometimes also say, I’m in sales, not management. What I mean
by that is that we are not more committed to Christ by using him to
commit people to hell, as if that’s telling people the whole truth, even if
it’s politically incorrect. I would rather be theologically correct and say
that Christ has a purchase on all things and all people, because in him
was life, and the life was the light of all people.
That isn’t a slight to other religions, either. Making a grand claim like
this about our faith isn’t making a grand slam against other faiths. Every
religion makes universal claims to truth. Sometimes these claims
compete with ours, but often we are talking about different things. If
Christmas teaches us the truth that Christ himself is life, then we should
also be able to look for him in the truths of other faiths, too. After all, we
sing “Joy to the World,” not “Joy to the Christians Only.”
In him was life, and the life was the LIGHT of all people.
If you hadn’t noticed, Christmas lights are everywhere. We light our
Christmas trees, our houses and our yards. We light candles. Christmas
and light go together because Jesus says about himself, I am the light of
the world. In Matthew’s Gospel, Jesus tells us, his followers, that we are
the light of the world. And we will take up that theme more after
Christmas. But in John, Jesus says that he himself is the light of the
world. And John says that he is the true light, which enlightens every
person.
The first meaning of this idea could be tied to the sense that human beings have sense. We are sentient beings. That is, we think. We not
only live, like plants and animals; we also know that we live.
Light is tied to knowledge in the Bible. To be enlightened is to know
something or perceive something about the truth. In the long course of
continuing creation, symbolized by the six days in Genesis, you will note
that animals and humans were created on the same day. That is, we
higher life forms are closer to one another than to the rest of creation.
What we mean by higher has to do with this leap into consciousness that
makes us human beings made in the image and likeness of God. Thus to
say that Jesus is the light of the world is to say that he is the source of all
knowing. He enlightens us. He makes us aware of who we are, who God
is, and how we are to live in the world.
Hail, the Sun of Righteousness, Charles Wesley wrote. That’s Sun—S-U-N,
although it could just as easily be S-O-N, don’t you know?! Hail, the Sun
of Righteousness, Light and life to all he brings.
C.S. Lewis said something profound about this idea. I believe in
Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it,
but because by it I see everything else. As the light of the world, Jesus is
the constant of the universe who allows us to see and measure and
weigh everything else.
But light also has a moral quality about it. It distinguishes truth from
error, the beautiful from the ugly, the good from the bad. Sadly, this is
something that too many of us fear, preferring darkness to light. But
that’s because we fail to understand the nature of God as pure and
unconditional love.
When Tom was a teenager, he and some friends were one day walking
around the neighborhood. It was a warm night. Suddenly one of them
saw a police car and shouted. They hadn’t done anything wrong, but
they didn’t want to be seen, either. So they began to run. The police car
saw them and watched them turn down an alley. Tom tripped and
knocked over some trashcans. The police officers got out of the car and
began to go after them. One of the officers turned on a searchlight. Tom
looked around for his friends but didn’t see them. All he saw was that
burning, searing searchlight, looking for him. Tom jumped behind those trashcans, only to find his friends huddled
there. They frantically tried to hide, pulling trash over their heads and
hoping to blend in. The spotlight fell on Tom.
Come out where we can see you, said the voice behind the light. Tom
stood up where he was, covered in garbage.
What are you doing? said the voice.
Tom stammered, Nothing.
The voice said, I can’t hear you. What are you doing?
Tom said, Officer, I wasn’t doing anything wrong; I saw the light, I ran, I
knocked over these garbage cans. I’m sorry about the disturbance.
The searchlight was beaming into his eyes, blinding him. He stood there
in the light with nowhere to hide. Then the voice said, I think I recognize
you. Don’t you live around the corner?
Yes, he stammered. His heart was racing, and he thought to himself, My
life is ruined. If I don’t get arrested for disturbing the peace, something
worse will happen: this officer is going to tell my parents.
But then the voice behind the light said something unexpected. Son, I’m
not here to punish you; I’m here to protect you.”
As he stood before that searchlight, Tom says he caught a glimpse of
what it means to stand before Jesus, who is the Light of the World. There
he was, fully exposed yet completely protected. He was fully revealed,
yet free from unnecessary punishment. He stood hip-deep in garbage,
yet cleaner than he had ever felt, somehow cleansed by a light that cast
no shadow.1
Light and life to all he brings. There it is. Merry Christmas, friends.

"PART ONE: Foreshadowing
In his meditation today that has prepared us for worship, Mark
Wingfield points out the role the Old Testament plays in Handel’s
Messiah. The librettist, Charles Jennens, wanted to show the link
between the promises of the prophets and the fulfillment of those
promises in Jesus.
Isaiah features prominently in Messiah, and this passage from chapter 7
is the nativity link. It promises a sign of salvation: A young woman is
with child, it will be a boy, his name shall be Immanuel—meaning that
God is with us, and before he is weaned from Gerber baby food, all the
kingdoms of the earth that they dread will be shown to be powerless
before the God who comes to save.
We don’t know who the child was in the time of King Ahaz of Judah, to
whom the prophecy was first given. It might have been a child of Ahaz
himself, of Isaiah, or of someone else. Or maybe it was only a poetic way
of telling time. But the point is that Ahaz and Judah would have a sign of
salvation from God.
The kingdom of Judah, centered in its capital, Jerusalem, was shaking in
its boots over threats from the military and political alliance between
two neighboring kingdoms—Israel to the north and Aram to the east.
Those kingdoms wanted Judah to join them in fighting the fearsome
Assyrian Empire, which was to the northeast in what we now call
Syria—if there is anything left of Syria after the war crimes of Assad, the
assistance of Putin and the murderous Islamic State. It has always been
true in human history that we think war and violence are the kind of
power that wins the peace. But all that does is continue the neverending
cycle of war and violence.
Isaiah points to a different way that will break the cycle. He says that
God is giving a sign of salvation in the birth of a child. A baby is no
threat. A child does not inspire dread. And yet this is the way God will 
2
save Judah—and by extension the whole world.
The birth of the child to a young woman has short-term and long-term
meaning. In the short term, it was a sign of salvation to King Ahaz and
Judah that God was with them. In the long term, it would be a
foreshadowing of salvation through the birth of Jesus.
Foreshadowing is a literary device that arouses hope in the reader by
dropping a hint that something more is to come. That something more
would be someone more. The boy born to a young woman in Isaiah’s
time would become the template for the boy born to the Virgin Mary—
who would be a template for the birth of a new humanity altogether.
This was Jennens’ intent in Handel’s Messiah—to invite us to put our
trust in the God who always has been and always will be with us and for
us. Jesus is the sign of salvation for the world … even now, even for you.
PART TWO: Foreshortening
If foreshadowing is a literary device in the realm of time, foreshortening
is an artistic device in the realm of space.
During the Renaissance, painting became more realistic because of a
breakthrough in perspective called foreshortening. Before that time,
figures often looked as if they were floating in space. But artists like
Masaccio realized that if you paint what is closest to you larger and
what is farthest from you smaller, you can improve perspective and give
depth to a two-dimensional surface. It’s like the illusion of painting
railroad tracks farther apart at the bottom of a canvas and closer
together at the top. It’s the way our eyes see things in the threedimensional
world, yet we intuitively know that the tracks are not
actually getting smaller; the distance just makes them look that way.
When Isaiah and Matthew tell us that the child to be born is
Immanuel—God with us—the sign of salvation is both a foreshadowing
and a foreshortening. The child born in Isaiah’s time is a foreshadowing
of the distance being bridged between past and future in Jesus. The child
born in Mary’s time is a foreshortening of the distance being bridged
between heaven and earth—also in Jesus. The God who always seemed distant from us has come near to us. The
God who was apart from us has come to be a part of us. The distance is
overcome by the foreshortening act of Incarnation.
The key to the foreshortening technique of painting is to believe what
your eyes are seeing. If the trees in the distance look smaller than the
trees close to you, you paint them smaller, even though your mind
translates them as larger than they appear.
Likewise, in the coming of Jesus we are invited to see the God, whom we
could only imagine as far off, now right in front of our eyes. This life-size
vision of God in Jesus changes everything. Now we must believe what
our eyes are seeing. We must accept the truth that in Jesus, God has
come near, and salvation is at hand.
Jesus is the clue to the meaning of life. He takes away our fear of the
future. He bridges the distance between the invisible God and the visible
world. He puts at peace every broken part and every broken heart.
If you are estranged from someone and can’t find your way back
together, the presence of Jesus promises a way. If you feel yourself going
to pieces because you can’t forgive yourself for your sin, the presence of
Jesus promises that peace is possible. Anything broken can be made
whole. Anything torn asunder can be mended. Anything at odds can be
evened by his unifying presence.
What the Bible wants to tell us— and Messiah wants to show us—is that
all of time and space come together in Jesus. He is the Savior of the
world. This makes him your Savior, too. You can’t make him your
Savior; believing in him doesn’t make it so, but it does line up your heart
with the full depth and breadth of God’s eternal love.
So will you believe in him today? ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",12/18/2016,
"“Sunny day sweepin' the clouds away
On my way to where the air is sweet,
Can you tell me how to get,
How to get to Sesame Street?”
Don’t act as if you don’t know this song. I’m sure many of the parents in this
room have continued watching the show…even when the kids were already
put down for their naps.
But if you really don’t know, Sesame Street, created in 1969, is a children’s
television show. Sesame Street has won 167 Emmy Awards and 8
Grammy Awards. It is known for its educational content communicated by
use of Jim Henson's Muppets, animation, humor, and cultural references.
Each Muppet has a unique characteristic, to be inclusive to every child
watching. “Oscar the Grouch was created as an indirect representation of
someone who was poor and underprivileged—easily judged from the
outside, but possessing a good heart on the inside. Herry Monster was a
stand-in for kids, who felt awkward and clumsy versus his peers. Telly
Monster stood for all the worries and anxieties that a child might have,
when trying new things or confronting old fears.”1
Jim Henson believed in allowing a character to grow organically; it was the
job of the puppeteer to uncover it.
Yet, I recently read an article that informed me all this changed with the
creation of Elmo. For 14 years, this Muppet was passed from puppeteer to
puppeteer. No one knew how he was to fit into society or a voice which
was supposed to influence children.
Elmo was to be lovable, cute, cheerful, and naïve. The author of the article
states, “It’s extremely appropriate that Elmo refers to himself in the third
person, because Elmo is the only thing that Elmo is concerned with. He was much different than other Muppets… His focus was on how the world
would affect him, rather than how he could affect the world.”2
When he didn’t get his way, he would break out into a temper tantrum.
When he was told “no” he would argue and back talk to adults. And
everything had to be done in his timeframe. Elmo is not only a brilliant
reflection of our time, but in some ways, he is continually molding
generations in this behavior.
Sorry if I just ruined your childhood, by the way.
James’ letter is not only unique to his community, but even to us. Because
in some ways we are one and the same. His letter is quite different than
other epistles we read. Where Paul is writing to one community or church,
James’ letter is written to widespread communities of diverse backgrounds
and ethics. The purpose of this epistle is to caution the readers to use
Christian patience. However, James must relay this message through
many avenues to reach each community.
James has something to say to all of us, including the Elmo’s: patience for
those with afflictions, patience during prayer, patience dealing with the rich,
patience in speaking and ethics, and patience when waiting on the Lord’s
return.
But what is patience? When translated from Hebrew it means “to wait” or
“to expect.” Or from Greek it means “to endure” or “to be steadfast.” And if I
were to ask some of you, “what is patience?” I am sure your answer may
sound much like sitting and doing nothing.
We are not a country that thrives on patience. I will just speak for my own
generation. I am a millennial and we are not the most patient group. We are
known for many aspects, but patience is surely not one of them.
In a society that knows what it wants and wants it when it desires it,
patience seems more of a downside then an actual asset.
As the late Harvard professor Peter Gomes preached, “Patience implies
passivity, and we wish not to be passive, we wish not merely to be spectators at somebody else’s spectacle of achievement. We want to do
what it takes to get things done … We want to know what we can do. Not
what we must endure or bear or suffer through. We don't want to be told to
wait. We want to get on with it, whether it is worth getting on with or not.”3
We don't want “Be ye patient, beloved …” We want what James wrote
earlier in the letter, “Be ye doers of the word and not hearers only.” That's
what we want to hear and do. Well, “do in our own time,” I guess I should
say.
It was scriptures like “be ye doers” that caused some theologians to
disregard this epistle. Martin Luther, being the most well-known, felt it
lacked validity. He came to this conclusion because of James’ substantial
focus on action and work rather than faith. Luther assumed James did not
define grace or salvation through faith, but only on works. Martin Luther
overlooks James’ notion that there must be action done while holding onto
the faith we believe. Yes, we are saved by grace, but how do we show this
grace- filled life without action being connected? James is not asking us to
pick faith or works, but to include both. Through our faith our actions should
be different.
In the same way, he is not saying patience is just to sit and endure, wait
and expect. Action is required, as well.
For James, patience in and of itself is not passive, but active.
The patient person acts often even though they wait. There is wholeness in
acting and waiting.
To get this point across, James gives the imagery of a farmer. “The farmer
waits for the precious crops from the earth, being patient with it until it
receives the early and late rains.” He states this to a community who has a
few farmers, but not many. Some would say he is writing to a sophisticated
audience.
I imagine readers stopping and saying, “What is this brother talking about?”
Some of us here may be asking the same thing about this random imagery. But those from East and West Texas or even Oklahoma, know the last
thing a farmer is doing is just sitting and waiting.
Yes, patience is the essence of farming. But the farmer is anything but a
passive participant. There must be tilling and toil, even before the seed is
ever placed. While the seed is in the ground, there must be cultivation
happening during the entire germination process. Harvest is the result of an
unbelievable amount of work.
Yet no matter how much work is done, the farmer cannot control the rain.
She cannot decide the date of sprouting. Nor can he determine which
seeds will develop and which won’t. That is where waiting comes in
because harvest is also the result of an unbelievable amount of waiting.
If the farming analogy didn't work for you, maybe this will work better.
Martha Stewart you know as famed chef, party host, hardened criminal,
and now Snoop Dogg’s best friend. She gives this advice when making
risotto. Do not fear but believe. There is one main problem that consistently
happens with amateur cooks when making this dish. They believe it is like
making rice. You just let it boil for 30 minutes and suddenly it is ready. It is
not that easy. Risotto, for many, is one of the hardest recipes to make
because it takes a while to cook.
There also must be constant action while you wait. You must slowly pour
chicken broth into the pot. And as you are pouring, you must continue to
stir the rice and other ingredients for 30 minutes straight. And you stir, stir,
and stir. In your mind, you think the rice is never going to get to the right
consistency, but you keep on pouring broth and you keep on stirring.
Finally, as you come upon the 30 minutes you begin to have hope that the
rice is getting softer and sauce is getting thicker.
You cannot just believe the rice will get to the right consistency. You cannot
just leave the top on the pot and wait for a rolling boil. There must be action
during the wait. You keep stirring because you know what the end product
will be.
That’s patient action. Through this action we realize patience protects the “good reason.” It keeps
us moving toward where we are rightly headed.”4
 We wait and act because
we trust and believe the product is the coming of Christ and kingdom of
God.
We must discern the moaning and groaning of God’s people in the world,
even if it is within ourselves. We must see where the Holy Spirit is moving
and partaking. If the promise is to come of a world reconciled to God, a
virtuous world that does justice and loves mercy, we must put our hands,
feet, and hearts to work. We must prepare a way for the coming of the
Lord.
Our season of Advent, our time of waiting, is not a time of being idle. It is a
time of preparation. We must do all the work that can and must be done.
Believing and trusting time and God alone will bring to completion the
expectation of God.
We must put away our selfish ideals, let go of our timeframes, set aside our
plans and blueprints for the kingdom and release our morality which
revolves around our own pleasures and achievements. Because it is not
about us.
We must find ourselves participating in bringing hope, peace, joy, and love,
just as Christ is to the world. Because this coming of Jesus’ return is not
just any day now. The anticipation does not end when Advent is over, but
will happen when what is needed has fully taken place.
And whatever the length of time may be, we as Christians must wait. Wait
with a strengthened heart and hopefully callused hands, working and living
within the values of Christian traditions and the good news of Jesus Christ.
This week D Magazine published an article revealing how bad poverty is in
Dallas.
Did you know homelessness in Dallas has increased 21 percent? Or that
Dallas has the highest number of people living below the poverty line of any
American city? Over 27,300 residents live in poverty despite having full-time employment.
Thirty-eight percent of Dallas children live in poverty, 20 percent have no
health insurance, and 28 percent have inadequate food and nutrition.
You may be thinking, “Timothy, why are you telling us this? We can’t solve
poverty.”
I know adding more work to your plate during this season is the last thing
you want to hear. But maybe you are not just satisfied with waiting and
hearing of this in your own city.
So, I challenge you to act.
At the end of this service you can go right out these doors and take a name
from the Giving Tree and give a gift to a child in need.
I am sure most of our dining room tables have extenders. Invite a family
over and share a meal that would be more than enough for you and your
family.
And if your table does not have an extender, take a note from Tim and
Jorja Krause who borrowed another table from their neighbors in order to
host a dinner for young women at Our Friends Place, an organization for
neglected, abused, or struggling women. They had a full-on Thanksgiving
meal with strangers. They ate, they laughed, and even danced to
Beyoncé. To quote Tim, “For a brief moment, [these girls] left the stark
realities of their pasts and difficult choices for their future to the side, and
just celebrated life.”
No, you cannot cure poverty but you act in a way so another may be able
to celebrate life, even if it is for a few moments.
I challenge you to sow a seed of love, joy, hope and peace knowing the
seed can't grow without cultivation and the rice won’t cook without mixing.
Patient action is all about working well for what we are waiting for. This is
the essence of Advent. Amen. 
",Timothy Peoples,"Dallas, TX",12/11/2016,
"The whole season of Advent is about the whole world—people and
animals, stars and angels, all the scenery and characters in a Christmas
pageant. And the reason is simple: Something in us resonates with
something in the Christian story that it’s about everything and
everyone.
It’s a big vision—huge. Yet we do all kinds of things to make it small.
Why is that? It’s because we drop the Y, that’s why. The Y that separates
your from our.
We love our country. “Make America Great Again.” Okay, fine, but the
people in 195 other countries also love their countries. Do we have to be
great at their expense? We want our children to get a great education.
Fine, but how? By electing state officials who will give vouchers to send
our kids to private schools while most children in the mostdisadvantaged
neighborhoods will be stuck in schools that have been
given up on and starved of funding? We love our pets. We dress up our
pooches with Christmas socks and a Santa hat and post the pictures on
Facebook. Meanwhile, children in South Dallas can’t play in the streets
for fear of being attacked by rabid, hungry, stray dogs that our city can’t
seem to get under control, although we would never allow this situation
to happen in North Dallas. We could go on and on and on.
And on earth, peace? There is yet no peace on earth. And yet today is
Peace Sunday. We are incurable peaceniks, we Christians. We keep
talking about it in the face of all this evidence to the contrary. Why?
Because Someone has put it in us to. There’s something in us that won’t
let us quit dreaming of and working for peace—not only for us but for
the whole of creation.
So what does it look like, this peace that Isaiah envisions? It begins with
a wise and just ruler who will arise from the stump of Jesse—that is,
from the line of King David; that is, from among the Jews. The one who
is the key to the peace of all creation comes from a people who have
been despised and rejected by the world forever. The powers of the 
2
world have subjugated them, threatened them continually, made
scapegoats of them for every problem they faced. Their murdered
bodies lie in mass graves all over the world. They’ve been shoved alive
into ovens constructed for their incineration. They’ve been hanged from
gallows, and one, at least, was hung on a cross. Try to take this in, dear
Christian friends: The Prince of Peace, who will rule the world to come,
comes from this people; praise God. He will rule in righteousness and be
known by his spiritual, not his worldly, power. He will defeat enemies
with words, not weapons. He will prove that right makes might, not that
might makes right. The poor and the meek of the earth will no longer
fear, because he will care for them and defend them with the same
standard of justice he would apply to the rich and powerful.
And what about the rest of creation? Instead of the animal kingdom
operating in the “red in tooth and claw” way of pursuer attacking prey,
natural enemies will live in peace. The wolf shall live in peace with the
lamb. The cow and the bear shall graze together, and the lion and ox
shall eat straw together. (And if all these improbable things come to
pass, I suppose I will even learn to like salad, don’t you know?!) Then he
says that a nursing child shall play over the hole of a venomous snake
and an older child over the den of even- deadlier serpents. And in a final
flourish, he declares that no one will hurt or destroy anything any
longer on God’s holy mountain—which is Mount Zion in Jerusalem, the
place of perpetual conflict in the history of the world. When these things
begin to take place, they shall be a signal of peace to the peoples of the
earth.
This, then, is what biblical religion has to offer the world. A vision of
peace big enough to be worthy of our hope. This is what we are called to
live into as people of faith. And the only way we can do that is to do
what that wide-eyed, locust-eating prophet, John the Baptist, told us to
do: Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.
Now there’s a killjoy preacher out of touch with the Christmas spirit.
Repent, he says. Here we are trying our best to get ready to make it a
good Christmas, and here comes John telling us to repent.
To repent in the Bible means more than being sorry for your sins and
amending your behavior so that you won’t sin again, whatever it was that you did. It means seeing the Truth that is appearing before your
eyes and adjusting your life accordingly.
John says we are to repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near—
that is, on account of the fact that it has. What God has promised to do is
to bring to pass a world of peace and justice where no one and no thing
need be afraid and where all relationships are aligned the way God
intended—this is now right in front of us. It is now visible in the coming
of the sprig from the root of Jesse—Jesus the Christ. To repent, then,
means to believe in what God has brought to pass already in Jesus and
to join him in being signals of peace on earth.
Repentance literally means to change your mind. And God knows we
have trouble with that. We get our minds fixed in a certain way, and we
have no intention of changing them. That is the definition of sin—to be
turned into oneself. To be closed to the truth by assuming you already
have it. God can’t get to you. Reality can’t get your attention. It’s like you
have closed the blinds and drawn the curtains and locked yourself into a
way of thinking that is forever fixed. Nothing can move you. And you
may even resent being asked to consider changing.
The Episcopal monk Brother John Braught reminds us that following
Jesus will almost always be inconvenient. A convenient spirituality is no
spirituality at all, because it means we are simply doing what we feel able
to do, or what we feel comfortable doing. If it is convenient, it means we
don’t have to rely on God very much.
However, God will not rest until we reset our minds on the kingdom of
heaven that has come near in Jesus Christ. To repent, then, means to
stop and to start. We have to stop thinking and acting one way and start
thinking and acting another.
What would be some signals we could send out to the earth of this
coming peace in Jesus Christ? Drawing from Isaiah, we might agree with
our pastoral resident, Kevin Sinclair, who last week claimed that all sin
is a form of violence from which we must repent. Following on that idea
is that all true repentance will be a signal of peace.
Let’s take the matter of literal violence first. In our country alone, since the mass shooting of school children at Sandy Hook in 2012, there have
been—depending upon how you count—about 1,000 mass shootings
that have killed four or more people by the use of guns. Never again, we
said back then. I remember that four years ago many of us were here in
this room for the choir’s presentation of Handel’s Messiah, which we will
enjoy again in two weeks. I had to improvise my message to deal with
that horrendous crime that took so many innocent lives. And last year at
this time, two radicalized Muslims in San Bernardino, California, walked
into a Christmas party at their workplace, killed 14 people and wounded
22 others.
You can focus on their being Muslims if you want to, but that doesn’t
change the fact that the young man in Connecticut wasn’t Muslim, and
violence like this isn’t just a Muslim problem—it’s a human problem.
Pope Francis was asked about Muslim violence this week after an ISISinspired
man killed a Catholic priest in Rouen, France. He replied that he
could not limit his condemnation of violence to Muslims when there is
so much violence being committed by Catholic Christians all around the
world, too, and even in Italy.
We have to stop this madness and start finding peaceful ways of dealing
with our anger and conflict. This is repentance. Part of the answer may
be to pass laws, and I’m for that, but I’m not going to get caught in that
briar patch today. If Christians alone would repent of our need to justify
the use of guns to defend ourselves, we could send out a signal of peace
that would put the world on notice that we truly believe that the
kingdom of heaven has come near. There is no law that says I have to
buy a handgun or an assault weapon, even if it is legal. We need to
change our minds about what makes for peace.
But the issue is deeper than that. We must change our minds about
cutting the world into groups that are set against each other. Every time
we carve the world up that way, we do violence that undermines this
vision of Isaiah that we say is supposed to inspire us.
In the 1960s, Ruth Messinger, who would later become the borough
president of Manhattan, was working for the Jewish World Congress.
She was assigned to build a foster care network in western Oklahoma.
While taking her baby for walks, she saw signs on houses saying “Church of Jesus Christ.” So she knocked on the doors, introducing
herself, and got invited to attend evangelical church services. Some of
the things said during the services were insulting to her. Sometimes a
sermon mentioned Jews as Christ killers. Many of the people didn’t
think that women should be working outside the home, and they were
for the Vietnam War, which Ruth strongly opposed. But Ruth talked
about the kids who needed help, and afterward, when the pastor stood
up and asked: Who will partner with Ruth Messinger to help these kids in
need? half the church stood up and signed up. And Ruth said that if she
had let what they had said about feminism and the Vietnam War
prevent her from forming that partnership, hundreds of kids in western
Oklahoma would not have had caring foster homes.
We can’t let ourselves be divided against each other. We must push
through ways of thinking about conservatives and liberals, Jews and
Christians, and any other ways we slice ourselves up, and instead find
ways to work together to signal the coming peace of God.
I love what one Dallas man did this week. Fifty-three-year-old Justin
Normand manages a sign shop. He was so distraught over the state of
our divisions in America after the presidential election, he wanted to do
something. So this man, who looks a little like the kind of guy who might
just as well have been waving a Confederate flag from his pickup truck
as what he actually did, went to the Irving mosque and stood outside
with a sign that read: You belong. Stay strong. Be blessed. We are one
America. When asked about why he did it, he said, This was about
binding up the wounded. About showing compassion and empathy for the
hurting and fearful among us. … This was about my religion, not theirs.
There it is. True repentance. The kind of Christianity that brings Isaiah’s
vision more into view. It’s a signal of peace that we could do with a lot
more of. And somewhere, in some field of the Lord, I believe there’s a
wolf and a lamb settling down for a nap together in peace. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",12/4/2016,
"On a flight from Dallas to Austin, the outlaw country poet Waylon Jennings penned
words that have been a deep comfort for me in these turbulent times: “It don’t matter
who’s in Austin, Bob Wills is still the King.”
While bemoaning the rise of Nashville’s pop-country cloaked in sparkling rhinestones
but devoid of truth and suffering, and perhaps reflecting upon the unpredictable
nature of the democratic political process, Waylon wrote these words. The world
might roll along and forget Bob Wills, the Father of Texas Swing, the man who fused
together glorious immigrant musical traditions. Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys
taught farmers to dance and played the soundtrack to their love stories. Songs like
“San Antonio Rose,” “Roly Poly,” and “Take Me Back to Tulsa” buoyed boys and girls
above the water line of life on a Friday night just long enough to get a breath for the
week ahead. Kingdoms rise and empires fall but the Texas two-step isn’t going
anywhere any time soon, my friends.
“It don’t matter who’s in Austin, Bob Wills is still the King.”
Today marks the beginning of Advent, a time in the Bible littered with unjust rulers,
kings (both Herods and Caesars), men of power and desire who grab what they want
and do what they want, and yet, in the darkest moment, a great burst of light appears
on the horizon reminding the faithful and the fearful that we don’t care who sits on the
Throne of Rome, in Herod’s Palace, or even in the Oval Office. God is still the King.
And every king needs a herald. A mouthpiece. A prophet. And so today, we turn to
the Prophet Isaiah.
While it might be tempting to just think of prophets as predictors peering into the fog
of the future, a prophet worth his or her salt tells us about our future by pointing to our
past and present. Prophets paint pictures of possible futures, and Isaiah lays out a
blueprint for prosperity and the consequences of NOT choosing that path very clearly
for his audience in chapter one:
“…learn to do good, seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for
the widow…If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; but if
you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the Lord
has spoken.”
In our text today, we see a vision of God’s dream for the world. We see a world
where the weapons of warfare are transformed into the tools of the trade and tranquil
living. Not swords, but plowshares. Not spears, but pruning hooks. As George
Washington in the hit Broadway musical Hamilton says (while quoting the Prophet
Micah 4:4), “‘Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, and no one shall
make them afraid,’ they’ll be safe in the nation we’ve made.” In God’s dream, violence is vanquished. Bombs become bread ovens. Guns become
gardening gear. Knives trade killing for cooking. And the Prophet Isaiah says,
“Many people shall come and say, ‘Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to
the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk
in his paths…he shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many
peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning
hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war
anymore.”
An elementary school in Houston was hosting a job fair. My friend Kendra, who
taught 3rd grade, invited Matt, an Army Ranger who grew up at her church, to come
and tell the children about what it means to serve in the military, to fight for our
country, to be a professional warrior. One of the children asked, “Mr. Matt, what is the
most powerful weapon in the world?” This Army Ranger without missing a beat
answered, “Words. Words are more powerful than any weapon we could ever build.”
Is it any wonder, that we worship the Word?
Not the words on a page, but the Word made flesh.
Not words in a book, but the Word who’s next to each of us, calling us, inviting us
To see the other as another brother, to see a sister in the visitor who sits alone.
Could we possibly choose to participate in the future Isaiah paints? But how? By
making peace…and what better season to turn over a leaf than Advent? I think to
really grasp this concept we have to fix our fundamentally flawed view of sin.
If you grew up in the South, sin was pretty much a well-known list. Don’t drink, chew,
or go with girls who do. Also for Baptists, don’t forget the dancing. Right? There’s a
joke, where the punchline is “Because, it looks too much like dancing,” but I’m going
to leave that alone this morning.
For many of us, our theology of sin centered around behavior, action, and purity.
Clean livin’. Not healthy-eating so much, but certainly clean livin’, if you know what I
mean.
Growing up, it seemed to me like sin was all the fun stuff that everyone else got to do
because they weren’t Christian, or they weren’t really following Jesus as hard as I
was told I needed to. You hear this theology of sin in our larger culture. Chocolate Sin
Cake. Decadence. Indulge yourself. I once had a seventh grade girl tell me that she
was “wicked” because she had seen the musical Wicked (which is fantastic), but it’s a
cultural misunderstanding of our American theology of sin. Sin is the guilty pleasure
we indulge in on the side, or it’s an action which makes us impure.
This is not the biblical view of sin, my friends. So what is sin?
Socrates addresses this very question in his conversation with the priest Euthyphro.
Socrates, in his own roundabout way, asks his buddy Euthyphro, “Okay, you are a
priest. Explain this to me. Is something a sin because God says it’s a sin, or does
God say something is a sin because it is a sin.” Is there something intrinsic to sinful
behavior that is “sinful” or are all sins just a list of things that God says arbitrarily,
‘don’t do these things?’
It’s a great question! What do you think?
Why is lying a sin? Because it’s one of the Ten Commandments? The commandment
is actually “do not bear false witness.” It isn’t “don’t not tell your friend that that
sweater is ugly.” I can see it on your face, you little philosophers…what about white
lies, Kevin? Set that aside, I’m talking about the blatant, “Did you go see that movie
without me?” “Uhh, nope.” “Why aren’t you at work right now?” “Uhh…the building
caught on fire and they sent us all home.” I’m talking about that it’s-just-not-worth-it
lying.
Lying is a sin because it fragments relationships. Honesty is noble. Honesty is good.
Honesty is virtuous.
So, back to the question, what is sin?
Marjorie Suchocki says that all sin is violent at its core. It destroys our sense of self,
connectedness, and dignity. It rips apart relationships robbing us of our ability to see
our shared humanity. So God calls forth prophets. Prophets who speak the word of
God for the people of God. They remind us of God’s past faithfulness and our past
infidelity. It’s so easy to whitewash our past. It’s so easy to look back on golden days
long gone and celebrate our achievements, our accomplishments, but then
completely ignore the ways we have failed to do justice, love kindness, and walk
humbly with God.
Sin is that which is inherently violent. It is destructive. It’s not the little indulgence here
and there that we say, “Oh, I really shouldn’t,” it’s the decision that robs us of our
God-given dignity. Sin is the action that we inflict on each other when we are blind to
see God’s image in each other.
Sin destroys. Love heals.
Sin destructs. Love creates.
We see this view of sin as violence unfold in the first eleven chapters of Genesis
where we see the first four sins humanity inflicts on each other and on Creation itself.
Adam and Eve eat the very object that they have been told will bring death into their
bodies. Cain, in a fit of envious rage, bludgeons his brother Abel to death with a rock in a field. Noah lives in a world where, as the scripture says in Genesis 6:11-13, “the
earth was filled with violence.” Then finally, in the Tower of Babel, we see humans
building a Tower to heaven so that they can invade and conquer God’s Kingdom up
there.
Well, the Good News is that God’s Kingdom is coming down this way, and the King
who was King is still the King, and it doesn’t matter who is sitting on which throne or
behind which desk; the one who was crucified and rose from the dead is still the King.
“For a child has been given unto us, and the government shall rest upon his
shoulders, and his name is Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father,
Prince of Peace, and his authority shall grow continually, and there shall be endless
peace.”
If that sounds familiar, it is also a word from the prophet Isaiah. You see, our future
hope does not hinge on our present realities. In God’s Kingdom, it’s always darkest
before the dawn.
Words are powerful instruments. Timothy Peoples taught me at Wednesday Bible
Study this week that Aristotle calls humans, “the animal who uses words.” Strangely
enough, the ability to use words might be less unique to our species than we might
like! I also learned this week that scientists have discovered that the vocabulary of
prairie dogs is so complex that it includes adjectives. Adjectives! A prairie dog can
communicate a sentence as complex as “Turn around! There is a green snake
coming on your right side.”
If the idea of prairie dogs chatting away in their little tunnels isn’t cute enough for you,
scientists have also discovered that baby dolphins name themselves. I don’t know
about you but that’s the most adorable thing I have heard in a long time.
Communication is the cornerstone of the creation. Bees buzz back to the hive
carrying pollen to be processed into sweet honey, while our own bodies’ immune
systems send signals to alert our antibodies of viral intruders coming to take us down.
I asked Gloria Martin, a therapist in our church, what’s the secret to a healthy
relationship, and she said, “Just keep talking.”
We have all heard that the pen is mightier than the sword, but do we really believe it?
Do we really believe that the most powerful weapon in the world is our words? We
are so often seduced by our desire for security that we feel tempted to surround
ourselves with walls. We build walls to protect ourselves from them…whoever the
“them” is. If we just keep talking with one another, if we manage to climb outside of
our echo chambers and learn from people who are different than us, maybe, just
maybe, our swords will bend and our spears will twist, and together we can grow
something good and beautiful in God’s world. Between the World Wars as Nazi Germany’s economy began to roar to
unprecedented power, a measure came before the British people. There were reports
of the hateful, bigoted treatment of Jewish people, gypsies, people who were
disabled and gay, and Catholics. The anti-Nazi boycotts were never adopted
nationally by the British or Americans because Germany had stuff that we wanted.
And we couldn’t live without our stuff. Ethicist Glen Stassen says that if we had gone
through with our non-violent boycott, the German economy would have crumbled and
Hitler would have been ousted without a bullet fired.
Now, I know that hindsight is 20/20. But, it doesn’t take a prophet to know that the
world might be a better, more beautiful place if we “just keep talking,” and if we learn
to “do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with our God.”
It might just work, if we gave it a shot, because Christ is still the King. Amen. ",Kevin Sinclair,"Dallas, TX",11/27/2016,
"There’s a new craze hitting social media called the mannequin
challenge. Here’s the idea: you get a group of friends or teammates or
coworkers together and strike a pose that looks like you were caught in
the act of doing something. Then make a short video clip of it, as if time
has stopped. We could do it here. Catching Doug say in the act of singing
or me preaching or an usher ushering, say. It’s fun to see what people
come up with.
What makes this interesting is the idea of still life, since life isn’t lived
like that. If you took a freeze frame of any particular moment in time in
our lives, it wouldn’t tell the whole story as much as a full length film.
Snapshots tell you something but not everything. They miss the flow of
what came before and what comes after. And no one life is properly
judged by a mannequin moment.
Take the church at Philippi, for instance. Overall, Paul seems to have
loved that church. They supported him financially when others didn’t.
They prayed for him and honored him when other churches questioned
his authority. And yet, in the mannequin moment we catch him writing
to them, they are going through something challenging and he has some
words for them.
Seems there were these two women who couldn’t get along. Go figure.
We don’t know anything about Euodia and Syntyche except that they
were troubling the fellowship for reasons we also don’t know, don’t you
know?! So in the verses just before these, Paul tells them to get their act
together and get together. And then he tells the church how to get its act
together. These verses are filled with imperatives about what to do in
order for the God of peace to reign in the congregation.
Last Sunday our church completed its voting on the question of whether
all members of our church should be entitled to the same rights and
responsibilities in Christ as every other member, regardless of sexual
orientation or gender identity. The answer was yes, but it was not, by a
long shot, a strong consensus. Euodia and Syntyche still disagree. And
the question is whether we’re going to turn this into a mannequin
moment and hold the pose forever, or let go of the tension and relax into a new rhythm of life together.
Change is hard and it’s painful. It always requires giving up something
familiar. That’s actually true for those who welcome the change as well
as for those who resist it.
Those who resist the change have held a view that the way things have
been is the way things should be from now till kingdom come. They feel
a sense of loss and judgment upon them because they participated in
the resistance movement to the change movement. They wonder if they
will have a place in the new order, or whether they even want a place.
Those who welcome the change have something to give up too. For a
long time, LGBT Christians have had to make themselves invisible in
order not be singled out. They have found ways to fit in, even as they
have internalized a sense of being marginalized. Now they have to learn
a whole new mode of being among us, and it’s not like flipping a switch.
They have to learn to trust us, to be open and honest among us, and they
have to let go of the resentment that lived in their hearts for too long. So,
can we find each other and live together in a new way now that reflects
the way of Christ? Can we be OneWilshire?
There are people here this morning for the first time who want to know
the answer to that before they move into relationship with us or stay
away. There are people here this morning for the thousand and first
time who want to know the answer to that before they stay in
relationship with us or move away. Look around. Every person you see
in this room is someone God loves as much as you that Christ died for
them too. They are your sisters and brothers, and they need to know
you know that as much as you need to know they know that about you.
I want to remind all of you that we were not a perfect church at any time
in the past, and we will not be a perfect church at any time in the future.
We are all only imperfect people striving toward a greater sense of unity
with Christ and one another. Our mission statement is constantly on my
lips in these days: The Wilshire mission is to build a community of faith
shaped by the Spirit of Jesus Christ. If we are forever building it, that
means we are never finished with it.
This reminds me of one of the most curious lines in the preamble to the
Constitution of the United States of America. The authors included this oddly phrased justification for the constitution: We the people of the
United States, in order to form a more perfect union, etc., etc. I always
smile when I think of that phrase more perfect union. Can perfect have a
modifier? Isn’t it like the word unique? Something either is unique or
isn’t, but it can’t be really unique or sort of unique. And something is
either perfect or it isn’t. But I still like the phrase, because I think our
founders where saying something about this project that is America.
The previous union we had established under the Articles of
Confederation wasn’t yet quite right. By establishing the Constitution,
the people were working to perfect a union that would never be perfect.
And when President Obama was a candidate in 2008 and needed to
address questions about race in the campaign, he called his speech A
More Perfect Union. Slavery is our original sin, and racism is its legacy.
Owning up to our sin and making racial justice a reality is a work in
progress. Our country is a project we are working to perfect. And the
church is no different.
So what shall we do? The first thing Paul says is to rejoice in the Lord.
Actually, that’s the first and second thing he says: and again I say,
rejoice. It’s like he knows we aren’t given to rejoicing in moments of
conflict and change. But notice, he doesn’t say get happy even if you
aren’t. He says to rejoice in the Lord.
Look, if you favored our decision, you may be elated today, but I would
urge you to do so in the Lord, which is never at the expense of your
sisters and brothers. I truly believe God is doing a new thing among us
that honors the gospel and will prove be a witness of grace that will save
lives and souls both. But Paul immediately after this says: Let your
gentleness be made known to all; the Lord is near. That word gentleness
may also be translated forbearance. Which means that we will hold off
dancing in someone else’s end zone as an act of Christian grace. On the
other side, those of you who feel like you lost something in all of this are
also told to rejoice in the Lord. You don’t have to be happy about an
outcome you opposed, but you can rejoice for those who are rejoicing in
it. That may seem unnatural to you, but hey, that’s what rejoicing in the
Lord is about; it’s a spiritual response, not a natural one. Nobody said it
supposed to be easy, this Christian thing.
Then Paul tells us not to worry about anything, but instead to pray with
thanksgiving. In other words, we are to give all this to God to sort out. We’re got to give up the illusion of control. And that requires practicing
gratitude rather than complaint.
I tell couples I am counseling about marriage that there will be things
about their partner that will annoy them. They have a choice about what
they do with that: they can either focus on the annoyance, in which case
the distance between them will grow until their hearts are cold and
brittle; or they can pray with thanksgiving for their partner. I don’t
mean pray that God take away the annoyance, because then you’re still
focusing on that. I mean pray with thanksgiving for all the things you
love about your partner. And when you do, it will change the way you
see him or her.
And that plays right into what comes next. Paul says, whatever is true
and honorable and just and commendable and excellent and worthy of
praise, think on these things. Ponder the good. Meditate on the noble.
Contemplate the virtues. We could all do with more of that right now.
Right now in the wake of the election some people are protesting in the
streets, too many are yelling screeds at one another, and still others are
taking moral license to push vulnerable people more into places of fear.
We can do better.
I was reading the incredible words of Dean Acheson this week from
back in 1952 when Adlai Stevenson lost the presidential election to
Dwight Eisenhower. Acheson had been secretary of state under Harry
Truman, and the Democrats had had a long run in power with FDR and
Truman covering twenty years. He talked about how change is a normal
part of life, even political change, and I would say spiritual ones too. He
then said: From this moment you should not go on fighting battles that
have been lost. … Do what nature requires, that is to have a fallow period.
Just let the field of your emotions stay barren, let new seeds germinate …
Have different activities; think of something else. Don’t read the New York
Times from cover to cover every day. And I would add, don’t let cable
news and social media run your day or it will ruin your day. I think that
should go for all parties right now. Have different activities, he said. And think of something else.
Father Joshua Whitfield of St. Rita’s Catholic Church writes an
occasional column for the Dallas Morning News. He wrote yesterday
about taking his daughter to an art museum as a way of dealing with his
post-election emotions. They took their time and looked at the works of
Spanish artists like Miro and Picasso and Dali. They giggled at the nudes,
and they tried at times in vain to figure out what this one or that meant.
They just let the beauty take over their hearts for a while. He said: I was
there because of her and because of this new sadness. Many parents have
wondered just what to tell their children; I chose art. Again, I didn't know
what else to do. I could only think to find beauty and to be quiet there.2
That’s a good place to start: focusing on things that are good, true and
beautiful. Let them nourish our souls right now as we find our balance
again and walk into this future together.
Paul ends by saying that we must do these things. Another way to
translate do is keep on doing. It’s not a one-time thing. Not a mannequin
moment. And another translation puts it this way: keep on practicing
these things.
Lawyers practice. Doctors practice. Christians practice. We don’t
practice because practice makes perfect; we practice because practice
makes more perfect. As in a more perfect union. As in a more perfect
church.
This week has been an emotional whiplash for many of us. High highs
and low lows. Our hearts have soared and our stomachs soured. But
there’s a promise tagged onto that call to keep on practicing these
things: and the God of peace will be with us.
As we close today, let’s practice that peace by passing it to one another
as we typically do on Communion Sundays. And let’s see if can sense
that the God of peace is among us. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",11/20/2016,
"This week, dear God, this week. Now, George, are you talking about the
election in our country or the election in our church? Yes. Anxious times.
Surprising turns. Bewildering feelings.
So here we are looking for a word from God again. And here I am again
telling you that the way I choose a passage of scripture to preach on is
generally—like last week and this week—to accept what is chosen for
me; that is, it’s a text assigned in the lectionary for these Sundays in the
church year. I didn’t go looking for a text for our context. Apparently, the
Holy Spirit has a sneaky way of pointing us to hope, wherever we look.
This Sunday is no different.
I’ll tip my hand to you about what that word will be by highlighting a
few instructions from Jesus in the passage. Ready? Don’t be afraid. Next:
Take this as an opportunity to testify. Finally: Hang on; you’ll get through
this because I will be with you.
There now, we’re done. Well, not quite yet. Let’s see what’s going on
that would lead Jesus to tell us these things. We’ll go back and forth
between then and now.
Luke is writing in about AD 85, and he recounts the story of Jesus
overhearing some people talking about the Temple in Jerusalem, about
how beautiful it is. They figure that it will last forever. Jesus tells them
not to count on it. As it turns out, of course, Jesus was right. About 40
years later, in AD 70, the Temple was destroyed and—so they thought—
was their world. They had always thought God lived in the Temple, and
they’d been told by their Bible that only sacrifices made at the Temple in
Jerusalem would be acceptable to God. Now there was no Temple. What
now?
The rabbis led the Jews out of Jerusalem, and they wandered about for
about twenty years trying to figure that out. They finally settled on a
more- portable religion that involved three things they could do
anywhere and anytime: prayer, Torah (that is, Bible study), and acts of
lovingkindness. Beautiful. Jews all over the world are still doing those
things. Christians remembered that Jesus had told them that he himself was the
true temple where God and humanity came together. That would
continue to be true forever, even after he died, because his resurrection
meant that he could always be found in our every human interaction
when we do what he commanded us by loving God and our neighbor as
ourselves.
You see, we are always prone to think that our faith is tied to religious
institutions, and sometimes to our buildings. Nothing lasts forever.
Things change. Things fall apart. But we don’t have to fall apart when
things fall apart. Our faith is founded on the living Christ, and he won’t
ever fall apart because his broken body is eternally being re-membered
in his church as we come together literally and figuratively around his
Table in sweet Communion.
And that goes for us here at Wilshire too. Yes, we are going through a
difficult time. It feels to some like impending doom as we look around at
this lovely building, adorned by beautiful stones and built by sacrificial
gifts from faithful members for more than 65 years, some of whom
worry about its future. And yet the church is not a building. What we are
building, as our mission statement says, is a community of faith shaped
by the Spirit of Jesus Christ. And that will always be changing if we are
faithful in our time. Gratitude for the past is proper—nostalgia not so
much. Gratitude spawns hope; nostalgia fosters fear.
It’s true that this disruption that many of us feel at this time is
disorienting. But it’s only the end of one way of being; it’s not the end, as
Jesus says. It may feel like an end, but the end is not yet. Jesus is Lord of
his church, and in every end is a beginning. Jesus calls us to look for the
new beginning, for what is coming to pass right in the very moment at
which it feels as if something is passing away. He isn’t finished with us
yet.
And that includes our denominational entities. Baptist institutions are
supposed to serve churches, not the other way ’round. They are
supposed to protect, not undermine, Baptist principles such as religious
liberty and local church autonomy, and to promote cooperation. When
they fail in that mission, it is because they have decided to let worry and
fear dictate their actions. Sad, but we have no control over that. What about the nation? Jesus said that nations and kingdoms will fight
against each other and that there will be great turmoil. And I think we
can also say that within nations there will also be fighting. We are seeing
that fact this week in the wake of our election. What we are told is that
the election of Donald Trump to the presidency is an expression of
antiestablishment sentiment. Our political dysfunction has betrayed
many Americans, so many voted to try something different. Some think
that this action was wise; others think it was unwise. But the point is
that Jesus warned us against putting our faith in human orders that
never last.
Keep this in mind, too: since Jesus uttered these words, there has never
been an extended time in history when people didn’t think everything
was falling apart. There have always been wars and rumors of wars.
There have always been natural disasters and famines. And, yes, there
have always been times when family members and friends were pitted
against one another, even betrayed by one another—or at least feeling
betrayed. This is the way of the world, people. It always has been, and it
always will be, until the true end of all things comes, and the kingdoms
of this world shall become the kingdom of Christ.
What does this truth mean for us today? It will mean the same as it
meant in Jesus’ day. Don’t put your faith in politics. All politics is
temporal. Only God’s kingdom is eternal. And don’t put your faith in
politicians to be your messiah who will fix this mess, any more than you
should put your faith in a preacher—present company included, don’t
you know?! Politics is something, but it isn’t everything. The answers to
our social and spiritual anxieties are not all with the state. When are we
going to learn that?
On the threshold of the Cold War in 1952, Harry Emerson Fosdick,
pastor of The Riverside Church in New York, was on the West Coast to
speak to the Pacific School of Religion. After acknowledging the chaos
and uncertainty of the time, he said these timeless words: The highest
use of a shaken time is to discover the unshakable.
That is exactly what Jesus was saying in Luke 21 and is still saying to us
now. Be still. Don’t be terrified inside when things are terrifying outside. God is still God. And this is the moment when you can be a great
witness.
I really hate it when I do research and find out that things I thought
were so aren’t so. Like the oft-repeated meme that there is one
character in the Chinese language that stands at the same time for both
crisis and opportunity. Sad to say, that isn’t exactly true, although
there’s enough truth in it to extrapolate. But the idea that in every crisis
is also an opportunity—that is true. And Jesus tells us that very thing
right here.
In the face of shaken times for religious institutions, political culture and
the natural world, we have an opportunity to testify to the unshakable.
Have we forgotten that testimony is our abiding privilege? We can do
and say so much for Christ during these anxious times if we ourselves
will not give in to anxiety because we are people of the living God.
I loved what Rabbi David Stern said this week in a letter to his
congregation in the wake of the presidential election: May we, who
praise the God who upholds the falling and heals the sick, help bring
healing to a nation sundered by toxic polemic. May we hold our ideals
with deep commitment and daily humility. If we are to be stubborn, let us
be stubborn about justice, compassion and human dignity. If we are to be
vocal, let us be vocal in the name of empathy and decency. If we are to be
passionate, let us be passionate for the good of all. Nice.
And then I quote from Russell Moore, the head of the Southern Baptist
ethics agency, with whom I find myself surprisingly agreeing more often
than you would guess. He also pointed to the church’s role in these
times as an opportunity to testify: No matter what the racial and ethnic
divisions in America, we can be churches that demonstrate and embody
the reconciliation of the kingdom of God. After all, we are not just part of a
coalition but part of a Body—a Body that is white and black and Latino
and Asian, male and female, rich and poor. We are part of a Body joined to
a Head who is an Aramaic-speaking Middle-Easterner. What affects black
and Hispanic and Asian Christians ought to affect white Christians. And
the sorts of poverty and social unraveling among the white working class
ought to affect black and Hispanic and Asian Christians. We belong to
each other because we belong to Christ. Can I get an amen?
So what can we do? We can look for opportunities to testify. That
testimony is first a witness that while others are flying off the handle in
fear, we are holding fast in faith. We will not be afraid. Then we can
testify by being the kind of church that embodies a witness of
reconciliation in Christ. We can teach the world what it looks like to love
across all our differences rather than pitting ourselves against each
other.
But finally we can take to the streets—not in unproductive protests of
words that sometimes lead to violence, but in acts of lovingkindness
that point the way to peace.
Our missions minister, Heather Mustain, posted a beautiful challenge to
us on her Facebook page this week after the election. She quoted her
aunt, who was disappointed in the election outcome but said: If you are
wondering what to do today, I suggest you grieve, yes, but also find
something that needs to be done for someone else and do it. Then Heather
offered us these suggestions as opportunities to testify: If you’re worried
about our children’s education ... then become a mentor with KidsHope or
a reading tutor with Reading Partners. If you’re worried about the lack of
affordable healthcare ... then become a volunteer with Healing Hands
Medical and Dental Clinic or CitySquare’s Health Clinic. If you’re worried
about the rights of women and girls … then become a HERO and champion
with Genesis Women’s Shelter. If you’re worried about those who are
hungry … then volunteer at White Rock Center of Hope’s or the
Wilkinson’s Center’s food pantry, or serve a meal at Cornerstone Kitchen
or The Bridge. If you’re worried about the status of refugees in the U.S. …
then volunteer as an ESL teacher or throw a baby shower for Gateway of
Grace. If you’re worried about our criminal justice system … then
volunteer as an executive with Prison Entrepreneurship Program and
mentor a man into reaching his dreams. There’s work to do [,] friends, and
it’s time to do something, to show up and to be present … .
Yes, it is. Our church’s vision statement says it well: We aspire to be a
bold witness to the way of Christ in our time. Now is always the time.
Amen. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",11/13/2016,
"Year after year after year, for 108 years, all they could do was hope.
Those lovable losers, the Chicago Cubs fans, finally realized their fondest
hopes this week: their team is now World Series champions.
Our former pastoral resident, Scott Dickison, is a lifelong Cubs fan, as
was his father before him. A year ago, the Cubs were swept in four
games by the New York Mets in the National League Championship
Series. The next night, Scott’s two-year-old son, who had gotten used to
watching his dad watch the Cubs go down to defeat night after night,
asked, “Daddy, where baseball game?” Scott said: I looked at him in a
way I imagine my father once looked at me and told him those words that
every Cub fan learns at far too early an age: “Son, there’s no more baseball
this season. We’ll have to wait ’til next year.”1
Well, at long last, baseball justice has been done. Dreams have come
true. And those fans who have gone on to their eternal reward without
seeing victory in their lifetimes are now celebrating above as Cubs fans
are below. For more than a century, Cubs fans learned that loyalty is not
about what happens when things are going well, but when things are
going badly. There’s no such thing as a part-time Cubs fan: you’re in for
thick or thin, or you aren’t in at all.
Today is All Saints Sunday in the church. We remember those who have
gone on to their heavenly reward without seeing all the fruits of their
faithfulness come to fruition in this life. They lived and died without
knowing the full joy of their labors. But their lives inspire us still. And
they inspire us precisely because of the way they lived when it was
hard. It was their character that counted. And their character was
proved by how they lived during tough times.
Our lectionary text for today is from Jesus’ Sermon on the Plain in Luke.
I told you last week about the contrast between Matthew’s Gospel, which records Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, and Luke’s version from
down on level ground. Luke’s Jesus has a variation on the Beatitudes
that includes a series of woes with the blessings. Blessed are the poor;
woe to the rich. Blessed are those who hunger now; woe to those who
are perpetually stuffed. Blessed are those who weep now; woe to those
who can’t stop laughing in this life. Blessed are those who are hated and
reviled in this life; woe to those who are spoken well of only now. In
each case there is a promise of table-turning to come.
The Christian faith is always future-focused. God is doing something in
the world to bring about a time of perfect peace and justice. The
inequalities and injustices of this life, the losses and sorrows, will come
to an end. The dream of God for all creation will someday come true.
And those who lived loyally in pursuit of that dream will know the joy of
it when it comes. Those who resist it and prosper now at the expense of
others will be sorry later.
Jesus continues the Sermon on the Plain, or what I am calling Plain Talk,
by giving explicit instructions on how to live in hope in the meantime.
The summary of all he says is this: live now as if the time of vindication
has already come. Live now as if victory is finally yours. Live now as if
God’s will is done on earth as it is in heaven.
Listen again to these astonishing words of Jesus: Love your enemies, do
good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who
abuse you. … Do to others as you would have them do to you.
Up to this time in Jewish tradition, the prime directive was to love one’s
neighbor. Jesus also said that on numerous occasions. But the great
debate among the rabbis was always the question, Who is my neighbor?
That appears in Luke’s Gospel in the remarkable parable that Jesus tells
of the Good Samaritan. While tradition was always trying to limit who
the neighbor was in order to know where to draw the line on love, Jesus
erased the line altogether. Love everyone, he says. Love those close to
you. Love those far from you. Love those who love you. Love those who
hate you. Love them all.
Amy-Jill Levine is Jewish, but she teaches New Testament at Vanderbilt
Divinity School. One of the great gifts she gives to the church is to keep us mindful of the Jewish background and assumptions behind the words
of the Christian Scriptures. But at this point, she finds no real parallel to
Jesus’ teaching that we love our enemies. This is an unprecedented
“Jesus variation.”
During the time of Jesus, we are told in the Jewish Talmud, a Gentile
approached the two great rabbis of that time, seeking to convert but
impatient with the long process of learning Torah in order to know how
to live as a Jew. He challenged them: one was the strict Shammai, and
the other—the more-liberal Hillel—was to teach him Torah while
standing on one foot. Shammai dismissed him as unserious. Hillel
accepted the challenge. He said this: Whatever is hateful unto you, do not
do to your neighbor. This is the whole of Torah. The rest is commentary.
Go now and learn.
This is the religious version of the medical mandate called the
Hippocratic Oath: First, do no harm. And the first way to do no harm in
relationships is to resist the impulse to hate or to retaliate in any way.
Almost a decade before his death, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.
preached a sermon on loving one’s enemies at Dexter Avenue Baptist
Church in Montgomery, Alabama. He actually believed that these words
of Jesus were so important that he tried to preach on this subject every
year, adding more and more layers to his understanding of it and trying
his best to live it out amid the terrible times of hatred and persecution
that he and black Americans faced daily in those days. I read his 1957
sermon this week. In it he said that the first thing to do when you are
inclined to hate and not love someone who has hurt or abused you is to
look deeply and honestly at yourself. The reason, he said, is to remind
yourself that it takes two to make for enmity. It is unlikely that all
hatred and abuse springs solely from a guilty person or group that
opposes or oppresses you. If you can own up to your own participation
in the conflict, you will have greater sympathy for your enemy.
Next, he says, when you look at your enemies, look not only to that part
of them that you deem evil; look at the good in them first. No one is all
bad or all good. By refusing to treat someone who has hurt or harmed
you in some way as pure evil, you create the conditions to one day find that person again in friendship.2
This is so important in our time. We are in an election week in our
country and in our church. We will vote in both cases on matters that
have divided us. We have different visions of how to fulfill our hopes
and dreams, of what these communities should look like. And along the
way, we have sometimes hurt one another and closed our hearts to each
other. Some have determined that it is better to live without one
another than with one another. Some would rather move to Canada than
live in a future in our country under the administration of the one they
didn’t vote for. Some would rather move to another church than live
under the conditions of a future determined by a vote they didn’t
support. But by doing so, we only prove that the way the world operates
is the only way open to us.
I am aware that this may be the last time many of us will worship
together. If you are one of those who have already decided that you are
leaving, I have something to say to you: Thank you. Thank you for all the
years of sacrifice and service. Thank you for the gifts of time, talents and
treasure that you have given to make us the church we are today. And if
you wonder how you will be remembered after you leave, I will tell you:
You will be recorded among the saints of this church. No one wants to
be judged on the basis of one decision or snapshot of time in a life. So we
will bless you and miss you.
And for those of you who are undecided, I want to say that there is a
place for you here. It may be hard, but it can be good. A good life, not an
easy life, don’t you know?! Let’s prove the gospel together by staying
together. But whether you leave or stay, don’t let hatred or bitterness or
resentment rule your heart.
Antoine Leiris lost his wife in the ISIS-inspired Islamic terror attacks in
Paris last November. He was left with a young son who would afterward
be motherless. Leiris wrote a Facebook post the next day that went
viral. In it he defiantly declared, You will not have my hate. When asked a year later about it, he said this, referring mainly to his duty toward his
son: When you’re a kid, what you need is protection and so I wanted to
make sure he felt secure. And by secure I mean emotionally secure and
secure because I took care of him. And if I let this feeling [of hate] enter
into our lives, it would have taken up all the space in our lives. … In our
hearts everything would have been heavy and I wanted our lives to be
light again. … He has the right to not worry about everything all the time.
He’s just a child. So I had to protect him from that feeling [of hate]. He’s
going to keep growing and growing, and that feeling cannot dominate his
life.3
There is a cost to us when we hate someone else. So first, as Hillel
taught, do not do what is hateful. But there is more that Jesus offers. It
isn’t enough to resist hating or retaliating; you have to do good toward
the one who has hurt or hated you. This is the positive content of Jesus’
Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
In his Second Inaugural Address, President Abraham Lincoln
acknowledged something mystifying about those on either side of the
Civil War: Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God, and each
invokes His aid against the other. … let us judge not, that we be not
judged. He then ended with these immortal words to heal the nation:
With malice toward none, and charity for all … 4
Charity is a King James word for love. Divine love. The kind of love we
are commanded to have for our enemies, who are really our fellows,
whether we want to acknowledge them as such or not.
After another hard election in 2001, President George W. Bush said
these profound words in his first inaugural address: Sometimes our
differences run so deep, it seems we share a continent but not a country.
We do not accept this, and we will not allow it. Our unity, our union, [are]
the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation. And this is my
solemn pledge: I will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity.5
The words of these presidents echo the words of Jesus and the examples
of the saints. Let us not give up hope, and let us not give up on one
another. The answer for the country and the answer for the church are
the same: love.
At least that’s what Jesus says. Now what do we say? ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",11/6/2016,
"Our Gospel reading today from Luke is a short story. Cue the snickers. I
know you’re already, some of you, humming the song to yourself, right?
Zacchaeus was a wee little man, and a wee little man was he … .
So, yes, he was short, Zacchaeus—in more ways than one, as this is also
a short story in length. Ten verses. Another little vignette brought to you
by Dr. Luke in his Gospel account of Jesus. But like all of Luke’s short
stories that come before and after this one, the Zacchaeus story is tied to
the bigger, longer story that is the grand theme of the gospel.
The story of Jesus in Luke is told at street level. If you go to John’s
Gospel, you get a view from above, so to speak—what we used to call
the eagle’s eye view but now maybe the drone view or the satellite view.
Luke always has us trying to see things from below, from among the
crowd, or down the back alleys of the cities, not just in the good
neighborhoods. Luke takes us on a journey that misses no one.
For most of this longer story, we learn the scandalous lesson that Jesus
is a friend to sinners. He’s guilty of consorting with people that the
righteous always think of as bad for the morals of youth. He welcomes
prostitutes when others would shun them. He cares for the poor—who
in Jesus’ day were deemed poor because of God’s disfavor of them for
some spiritual reason no one could name. Luke’s Jesus refutes this logic.
In fact, there are two places in the New Testament that record a long
sermon of Jesus: one in Matthew and one in Luke. Matthew’s account is
the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus is like the new Moses delivering the
word from on high. Luke’s version is the Sermon on the Plain. Jesus is
like a prophet among the people, delivering the word at eye level.
Matthew’s Jesus declares, Blessed are the poor in spirit. Luke’s Jesus
doesn’t qualify the poor; he just says, Blessed are the poor.
Luke’s Jesus makes it seem that although the rich have it made now, the
poor actually have the advantage with God. One short story after
another in Luke demonstrates this. And by the time we get to Zacchaeus
here in chapter 19, we’ve almost lost all hope that rich people have any 
2
chance at all with God.
In the chapter just before this, a rich man comes to Jesus and asks what
he needs to do to inherit eternal life. Jesus tells him to go sell all he has
and give it to the poor, and then he will know. The man goes away sad,
because he is very rich. And Jesus says, It’s harder for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle, than for a rich person to be saved. But then he
adds that what is impossible for us humans is possible for God.
So here we get the rousing finish of Jesus’ ministry of seeking and saving
the lost. He’s just about to go up the hill from the lowest and oldest city
in the world, Jericho, to Jerusalem, the city of David, where he will be
crucified. But all along the way there have been foreshadowings of what
his death will mean—of who it’s for and how it brings life when it looks
only like death. Zacchaeus puts a bow on Jesus’ intention to bring
EVERYONE in, to seek and save ALL the lost, to reach out and bring in
every person on the margins of Israel and make them know they are at
home with God.

Finally, we see that even the rich can be saved. And frankly, you ought to
be saying amen right about now—almost all of you, since almost all of
you, including me, are rich. We don’t like to admit it, because as long as
Warren Buffett lives, someone is richer than we are, and that means I
can claim to be middle class. Nope. If you live in the United States, you
are among the global elite. The global median salary in 2012 was $1,225
… per year! If you earn more than $34,000 per year, you are a one
percenter by the world’s standards, even if you need to make half a
million per year in the U.S. to qualify. The point is, we are, almost all of
us, rich enough to make it impossible to be saved, save that God makes
it possible for us.
That good news is something we particularly celebrate today on the eve
of the 499th anniversary of the Protestant Reformation. On Halloween
night in 1517, the Augustinian monk, Martin Luther, tacked his 95
theses to the door of the chapel of the castle church in Wittenberg,
Germany. Luther’s main concern was to restore the scandalous news of
the gospel. Salvation is God’s work, not ours—faith, not works. It is
God’s impossible possibility. God does for us in Jesus Christ what we
cannot do for ourselves. And the only way for us to experience this grace is to humble ourselves in order that we may be exalted.
That’s where the up-and-down part of this story comes in. Zacchaeus
was a chief tax collector for the Romans. This means that he had to pay
the Roman government an agreed-upon fee in advance for the privilege
of collecting every kind of toll and tax imaginable. The Romans looked
the other way if he overcharged, because that’s the way he made his
income. And the fact that he was a Jew cheating other Jews was a bonus
to the Romans—divide and conquer. But it made him a small man to his
fellow Jews. He had no stature. He was short on height, and he was short
on right.
Like most of us who think we can make a life for ourselves by ourselves,
there comes a time when we get sick to death of ourselves. We know we
come up short, no matter how big we try to make ourselves out to be.
Then here comes Jesus through Jericho. We aren’t told why Zacchaeus
was so eager to see Jesus, only that he couldn’t see him because he was
so short. First he runs in public—the first humiliation. A respectable
man would never have run in public. Then he shimmies up a sycamore
tree. And we can be pretty sure even now that this isn’t very dignified.
Zacchaeus goes down by going up; he humbles himself by making such a
climbing spectacle of himself. He just wants to see Jesus.
But when Jesus walks by, it’s Jesus who sees Zacchaeus. Zacchaeus
doesn’t call out to him; Jesus calls out to Zacchaeus. And this is the thing
about searching for God we come to realize. Whatever our search for
God, it’s nothing compared to God’s search for us.
It was never right to say what I’m about to say, and less so now than
when I heard it years ago, but here goes: A man chases a woman until she
catches him. That’s more true of God and us than of men and women. We
only think we’re seeking God. The truth is, God has put it in us to seek to
begin with. And just when we get in position to seek and find, we find
that God has been seeking and finding us.
Which is to say, if you are here today wanting to see Jesus, that very
wanting is all you need to be seen by him. He knows who you are. He
knows where you are. He knows you and wants to share life with you. He wants you to climb down from your tree of humiliation and stand up
to your dignity as a child of God.
But then again I don’t expect you to do any of this unless and until the
church, which is the body of Christ now, looks up at you in all your sense
of disgrace, calls your name and tells you it wants to share life with you.
After all, the only reason Luke writes his Gospel is to remind the church
how to carry out the mission of Jesus. As Lesslie Newbigin has put it:
The church does not exist for the sake of its members; it exists for the sake
of the mission of Jesus.
Derek Black is a young man that Jesus found in a tree searching for him,
even though he didn’t know he was searching. Derek was a white
nationalist. His father, Don, is a former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux
Klan. His godfather is the notorious David Duke. Derek grew up learning
the language and worldview of white supremacy, which includes both a
fiction about how much white people love and respect Jews and people
of color, but how they simply love white people more because these are
their people. It also includes the tiring refrain of white victimization:
how there’s a cultural plot to deny white people their place in society.
They even talk about the threat of white genocide. Derek was a young
man on the rise in that movement, writing and doing interviews
regularly on his father’s Web site.
But Derek was curious and driven to learn. He started traveling
internationally, which is dangerous to prejudice. He listened to other
people’s versions of life, which is even more dangerous. And when he
returned, he told his parents he wanted to go to New College in
Sarasota, Florida, a school known for its liberal arts, with emphasis on
the liberal, don’t you know?!
Derek was able to keep his identity under wraps for a year or two, but
one summer when he was traveling in Europe, someone at school found
his stuff on the Internet and outed him. Derek came back to school, but
he felt a change in the way people looked at him and treated him. Some
wanted to challenge him. But one student had a different idea. What if
we befriended him instead?
He invited Derek to his Friday night Shabbat supper at his apartment, 
5
along with other friends, who often included atheists, Christians, Latinos and Muslims. Matthew Stevenson was the only Orthodox Jew on the
campus. He hosted these meals to build understanding and friendship.
Derek showed up. Everyone was told not to raise the racism issue, just
to get to know one another and be together. They did this again and
again and again. Games of Monopoly and other activities led over time
to conversations about family and faith and culture. Barriers began to
fall and preconceptions to shift.
Before long Derek knew he was changing, or maybe he was being
changed. He eventually wrote a confession to the most unlikely group—
the Southern Poverty Law Center, an anti-racism organization that had
kept files on people like Derek, whom they believed were guilty of
inciting hate. He told of his change of heart and apologized for his past
actions. He is now actively working to build a more open and accepting
American culture, one based on love, equality and acceptance. Go figure.
People can change.
Derek was not converted to his new worldview by people who yelled at
him and called him a bigot; he was converted by people who loved him,
invited him to dinner, got to know him as a person, and were patient
with him, even in their differences.1
When Zacchaeus came down from that tree and hosted Jesus at his
house, he immediately promised to give half of what he had to the poor
and pay back four times any he had defrauded. Do you think that would
have happened without Jesus accepting him first? It surely hadn’t
happened until then, with a crowd of righteous people despising him.
I wonder what our world, our community, and our church would look
like if we all gave each other a little more grace and a lot less judgment. I
wonder what would happen if we really got to know one another at the
Table—whether the Lord’s Table or our own.
Now would somebody please pass the matzo? Amen. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",10/30/2016,
"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium is the tale of a 243-year-old toy store owner
whose toys come to life. In this movie, Mr. Magorium, who bought enough shoes
to last his entire life, realizes he is on his last pair. He struggles to find the right
words and the right time to tell his staff he is dying.
In one particular scene, Mr. Magorium shares with his top associate, Mahoney, that
he is leaving the store to her. He first gives her a cube, a block of wood, and tells
her it will guide her to a new life and adventure if she has faith and believes it will.
When Mahoney expresses her doubts and becomes upset about her ability to run
the store, he finally gains enough courage and finds the right words to tell her he is
dying.
He looks at her and says, “When King Lear dies in Act Five, do you know what
Shakespeare has written? He has written, 'He dies.' No more. No fanfare, no
brilliant final words. The culmination of the most influential piece of dramatic
literature is, 'He dies.' It takes Shakespeare, a genius, to come up with ‘He dies.’
And yet every time I read those two words, I find myself overwhelmed with
dysphoria. And I know it's only natural to be sad, but not because of the words ‘He
dies,’ but because of the life we saw prior to the words.”
Continuously through this Epistle, we find out Timothy has doubts, struggles and
feels he lacks the ability to be the chief pastor in Ephesus, which Paul appointed to
him. During these doubts, Paul does not give Timothy a cube to meditate on, but
rather hands him his calling and pushes him to believe in this calling for it will take
him to new adventures.
In our passage for today, Paul is encouraging Timothy to have faith, but Paul is
also struggling to find the words in order to say “He is dying” and I am sure this
struggle has to do with the life leading up to this death.
See, Timothy and Paul are not in the most convenient or comfortable places within
their lives. Timothy struggled to pastor churches in a time and place where image and luxury
take precedence over righteousness and sacrifice. It seems that everything he is
doing is counter cultural, pastoring during a time when the survival of the Christian
community seemed highly doubtful to any realistic observer. It can’t be faith
heartening at all.
Times haven’t changed too much; it’s what many of us face in today’s world.
And I’m sure when the personal courier came to Timothy, he had a sigh of relief
knowing Paul was still alive; but as he read, he probably became more and more
distressed.
Reading the words and picturing his friend Paul sitting in prison, the “House of
Darkness,” a dim, dank and dirty chamber. Alone and deserted.
To be deserted by all isn’t just a way for Paul to share with Timothy; he is scared
and lonely. But this phrase plays a role in meaning Paul’s source of food and water
has departed as well. Securing nourishment fell on the shoulders of the prisoner’s
family and friends.
I just imagine Paul sitting in his cell, holding on to the last few pieces of paper he
has left with a jar of noticeably dried out ink, and trying his best to write one last
letter.
As he got closer to the end of this letter, maybe Paul looked up from the paper and
saw a cup with very little water. Water he was slowly drinking to savor, not
knowing when the next cup may come. He remembered the quote he used when he
was last imprisoned when writing to Philippi, “As for me, I am already being
poured out as a libation” but this time instead of adding “I am glad and rejoice with
you,” he ends the quote with “and the time of my departure has come.” Realizing
this really is the end.
Paul’s metaphor is one that yields great influence. He uses this image of a libation,
a drink poured out as an offering to a deity, to show his essence is being poured out
as a sacrifice to God.
One writer1
 notes: libation carries special significance because it points to the very
usefulness of something to drink. Paul does not choose a pouring out image that
suggests wastefulness, but rather one of a saving water or wine. Paul is departing this life, preparing to die, and yet the term he chooses for his poured out self is one
of renewal and refreshment. To drink something is more intimate and personal. To
offer oneself as a drink for a thirsty people is quite different from just fading away.
Paul realizes he is not just a drink for a thirsty people, but one for a thirsty God.
The fighting a good fight, the running of a race, keeping the faith, traveling to
country after country proclaiming the good news, and being the living word, Paul
was quenching the thirst of God. Paul was quenching that which was a strong
desire and urgent crave for God. So all would know God in Christ is reconciling
the world and us unto God.
The myth is told, in the summer of 1993, that the Coca-Cola product Sprite was
needing to change its image, needing a little facelift, we could say. Sales were
down. The old campaign of ""I like the Sprite in you!"" was growing old and wasn't
catching the attention of manufacturers.
They were looking for something hip, something fresh, something that would
appeal to the younger generation. So Sprite contacted Lowe & Partners/SMS, a
New York based advertising agency known for its ability to appeal to the younger
crowds. Not long after being contacted the agency returned to Sprite with a new
slogan “Image is nothing. Thirst is everything. Obey your thirst.”
Sales increased. When they rated the advertisements, ninety-three percent of
consumers were between the ages of 18-24. It was a success.
Yet, when asking the chief advertising executive what his inspiration was for
coming up with the slogan, he said, “I just love looking through artifacts of
political history. I chanced across this one particular speech, and the speaker made
an aside about thirst that absolutely just stuck in my head. I felt that I could use it
somewhere, so I jotted it down. A month later, when Sprite came calling, the
match almost seemed too easy.""
The speech that grasped his attention was from 1971 when former President
Ronald Reagan, the Governor of California at the time, was addressing a gathering
of the Boy Scouts of America. In the middle of the speech he stopped, took a sip of
water, looked at the audience and said, ""Now, I certainly have spoken on a number
of different topics today. However, if you are to remember one thing, and only one
thing, it should be this: Speeches are nothing. Thirst is everything. Always
remember to obey your thirst."" Whatever you are wishing for with your whole heart or even striving to attain,
whatever it may be, don't leave it to be ignored.
Paul, in his writing, is pretty much telling Timothy, “The thirst is real!”
Paul’s words and life are to encourage Timothy not to obey his own thirst but to be
a drink offering to the Lord.
It is so easy for each of us to revert to our own thirst or desire for this world. In the
midst of trying to change the world or even thinking that we are making the world
better, we forget there is a calling on our lives which precedes our own desires.
Timothy is called to be the next vessel. He is called to “proclaim the message, be
persistent whether the time is favorable or unfavorable; convince, rebuke, and
encourage with the utmost patience in teaching, endure suffering and do the work
of an evangelist.”
When I hear the calling upon Timothy’s life, it forces me to ask, “Has my life been
poured out as a living sacrifice to God?” Better yet, “Have I even taken out time to
discern what God is thirsty for in this world in this day and age?”
I would say, it is true God is thirsty for justice, advocacy, beauty, creation care,
and goodness.

Former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, suggests what God is thirsty
for is you. It is for you and I to be who God has willed, created, and called us for
God’s purpose.

He states, “God does not create human ciphers, a pool of cheap labor to whom jobs
can be assigned at will. To be is to be where you are, who you are, and what you
are … God is calling you by your name, at each and every moment, warning you to
be you. … To exist really is to exist as responding to God. Each of us is called to
be a different kind of response to God, to mirror God in unique ways, to show God
what God is like from new and different standpoints.”2
But there is a connection and a challenge. The connection is God is thirsty for all
of those virtues and even us. The challenge, however, is in order to exist as a
response to God, fully living out our calling, we must be agents of Christ. Which
means we work alongside the Holy Spirit so justice, advocacy, beauty, creation care, goodness, and so much more can be carried out into this world. The challenge
is putting feet to faith.
We must reflect into the world the creative and redemptive love of God.
Responding to God with our relationships, stewardship, and our worship. Finding
ourselves telling the story and acting out the symbols of the table, where we are, as
who we are, and in what we are doing.
As living sacrifices, as vessels being poured out, our actions, words, and deeds are
done as a response to the God who created us.
Through this we may realize, like Timothy, we are called and created to be in
places that inflict pain, heart ache and some faithlessness. Or even like Paul, find
ourselves abandoned, suffering, and headed toward a tragic fate.
But the gospel we find in Paul’s words is that no matter the situation or even if the
significance of the situation is unknown, the Lord will stand by you and give you
strength.
Because of that, may we live our lives poured out for God. Lives remembering
saints like Paul who poured themselves out so we might find sustenance in their
unfailing faith. Living our lives as a libation so when we depart, we are leaving
words and actions as encouragement for the next generation of vessels. A life
quenching the thirst of God in order for us to one day say, “I have fought a good
fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved
for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give
me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for him” and
poured out for him
Paul’s words informing us of his nearing death should inspire Timothy, and all of
us, with the purpose of our life. His words yield boldness to rise and be the next
vessel quenching the continuous thirst of God in this world.
Well, Mr. Magorium continued to look Mahoney deep into her eyes and said “I've
lived all five of my acts, and I am not asking you to be happy that I must go. I'm
only asking that you turn the page, continue reading and let the next story begin.
Your life is an occasion. Rise to it.”3
Amen",Timothy Peoples,"Dallas, TX",10/23/2016,
"“Laugh and the world laughs with you; weep and you weep alone.”
Those are the first, troubling lines of a poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
She continues, “Rejoice, and men will seek you; grieve, and they turn
and go; they want full measure of all your pleasure, but they do not need
your woe…Feast, and your halls are crowded; fast, and the world goes
by. Succeed and give, and it helps you live, but no man can help you
die...” The title of Wilcox’s poem is Solitude and that is precisely where
we find Paul in today’s lectionary text. He’s in prison awaiting his
second trial. Paul narrowly survived the first, claiming that he was
saved from the lion’s mouth. He doesn’t expect to be so fortunate this
time.
Paul laments that none of his friends came to his aid at the first trial.
They shared his pleasure when the going was good, but ‘no showed’
when things took a brutal turn. So Paul awaits execution in solitude.
This isn’t how the story is supposed to end, is it? I’ve read enough
stories and seen enough movies to know that the good guy is supposed
to win the day, get the girl, and ride off into the sunset. The friends are
supposed to band together, right? Robin Hood had his Merry Men and
King Arthur had the Knights of the Round Table, yet Paul’s friends don’t
show up, and he dies without them.
No, it shouldn’t end this way. Yet our scriptures are full of such stories.
Moses dies before he can enter the Promised Land. King David dies
utterly friendless, even asking Solomon to put an end to his general
Joab, who once was considered a friend of David. John the Baptist is
beheaded as a mere party trick. And Jesus dies denied and deserted, as
well. It’s been called the greatest story ever told, but it just can’t seem to
get the ending right.
The Apostle Peter sees this, too, and in the book of Mark, when Jesus
tells Peter that he’ll be crucified, Peter draws Jesus aside and rebukes
him. This cannot be. He knows the story should end with Jesus sitting on
the throne of Israel as King. And I wonder if Timothy has a similar
reaction to Paul’s letter when he received it. Perhaps, like Peter,
Timothy’s first impulse is to rebuke and correct Paul. His first impulse is to pick up his pen and write back, “What is this talk of having fought the
good fight and finished the race? You cannot give up. You cannot give in.
Your time is not yet finished so get up and get back in the fight, get back
in the race.” And despite all of Paul’s urging to stay in Ephesus and to be
a good pastor, surely Timothy was tempted to take things into his own
hands and run to Paul.
We live in a world where, from our perspective, the story doesn’t always
end the way that we think it should. Where the evidence that we have
doesn’t always suggest that the good guy wins. That’s troubling and
unsettling. When faced with that information, some decide that we will
do whatever it takes to make sure that the story ends the right way or
that the appropriate outcome is reached, even sacrificing values and
morals along the way. To some extent, we believe that the end justifies
the means. Maybe we’re afraid of what will happen if our opponents win
so we slander and gossip or worse. This plays out in our countries, our
cities, and even our churches.
We can’t relate to Paul persecuted, like some Christian and nonChristians
in our world can, but we can relate in other ways.
There are many in our country who right now feel abandoned by their
political parties. The parties they’ve loyally supported for years have
not represented their best interests. Many do not feel that their voice is
being heard. And when they look toward the future, like Paul, what they
see doesn’t look too good.
Many of you here at Wilshire know all too well the sting of strained
friendships. We strive to live and love together as best we can yet we
have different perspectives on how to do that. The disagreement may
have put a burden on beloved relationships here. Maybe in one way, you
can understand how Paul feels. It hurts.
And Paul, feeling that same pain, challenges us in ours when he writes
about his own failing friendships saying, “may it not be held against
them.” It’s an incredibly Christ-like gesture that takes us back to Jesus
on the cross calling out, “Forgive them, for they know not what they do.”
It also reminds us of Stephen. In the book of Acts, Stephen is a great preacher and a miracle worker.
He did great signs and he publicly debated and won against anyone who
denied the truth of Christ. Not unlike Jesus, this upset the rulers and
false testimony was given against Stephen. He was arrested and
sentenced to death. While being stoned, Stephen kneels down and cries
out in loud voice, “Do not hold this sin against them.”
And who was Stephen talking about? Do you remember who was
complicit in Stephen’s execution? Our very own Paul before his
conversion experience on the road to Damascus when he was still called
Saul. He held coats at Stephen’s stoning, co-conspirator as are so many
who add their quiet support but aren’t in charge. And later, Saul made a
career for himself by traveling around arresting and prosecuting
Christians. Even seeing to it that some, like Stephen, received the death
sentence. So, in effect, Stephen is crying out, “do not hold this sin against
Paul.”
Saul, in the old days before his conversion, was one of those people who
knew how the story was supposed to go. He had read his Bible and he
knew where God stood on things. He then took whatever measures
were necessary to make sure that God’s way triumphed in the world-- a
temptation that we all face.
Paul fought for God’s way, but he didn’t fight in God’s way. He didn’t do
it because he was a bad person, and neither are we. He did it because he
was a good person taking things into his own hands. So when Paul, at
the end of his life, writes that he has fought the good fight, it’s because
he also knows exactly what it is like to fight the bad fight, that is, to fight
in the wrong way. And it is no small thing for us to read a dying Paul
saying the very same thing that a dying man once said to him so many
years before.
So what has changed Paul’s perspective so much that he can speak
peacefully of his death, forgiving the friends he must feel betrayed by?
Paul has relinquished control of the story. He’s stopped trying to win
and make sure that the story goes the way that it should.
Paul’s peace comes from his utter trust in God. Specifically, a righteous
God who makes all things right and rights all wrongs. 
Whatever unfair treatment that Paul receives here in this present age,
Paul has faith that God can and will make all things right in the age to
come. This is an active faith and not a passive one.
Here’s what I mean: Brennan Manning, the author of The Ragamuffin
Gospel, tells a story about a man who came to the edge of an abyss. As he
stood there, wondering what to do next, he was amazed to discover a
tightrope stretched across the abyss. And slowly, surely, across the rope
came an acrobat pushing before him a wheelbarrow with another
performer in it. When they finally reached the safety of solid ground, the
acrobat smiled at the man’s amazement. “Don’t you think I can do it
again?” he asked.
And the man replied, “Why yes, I certainly believe you can.”
The acrobat put his question to the man again, and when the answer
was the same, he pointed to the wheelbarrow and said, “Good! Then get
in and I will take you across.”
We have the ability to believe something in our minds, yet not be brave
enough to put our trust in it. The difference between faith as “belief in
something that may or may not exist” and faith as “trusting in God” is
enormous. Belief is a matter of the head; trust is a matter of the heart.
Belief can leave us unchanged; trust intrinsically brings change. Trust
climbs in the wheelbarrow.
Paul’s peace and our own peace comes when we actively put our trust in
our righteous God who makes all things right and rights all wrong.
We climb in the wheelbarrow each time we choose to forgive those who
have wronged us. Sometimes that means that we must accept an
apology never given, and that’s okay. We forgive because we are worth
it and our peace depends upon it.
We live in a world where the story doesn’t always play out the way that
we think it should, and that’s okay. When we put our trust in God, we’re
free to stop playing God. We don’t have to manipulate people or the
system to get the results we want. Results are God’s business. And we 
believe that God always speaks the last word. Even when we can’t hear
it.
And when the fight is over, the race is finished, and the story is ending,
whatever the outcome is, we can be at peace because we did all that we
could and we did it in the right way. And because God doesn’t tell stories
like we do. No matter how our stories end, God’s story of rescue and
reconciliation races on.
Moses may not enter the Promised Land but he is God’s instrument to
confront the most powerful nation on earth and rescue an entire people
group from slavery. He trains his successor, Joshua, who leads them into
the land and the story marches forward.
And it doesn’t end with David, but David’s story and his lineage lead us
straight to Jesus. John the Baptist defies the status quo of his time to
prepare a nation to receive the Messiah. John is just the introduction.
And Jesus isn’t defeated by death, but catapulted into victory. It’s
through his very death that he conquers. Death doesn’t end the story; it
doesn’t even slow it down.
And for Paul, dying alone doesn’t even really mean dying alone. He dies
at peace in the presence of his God, in solidarity with Timothy and
connected to the churches he planted. He dies leaving a spiritual legacy
that lives and nourishes us a half a world and 2000 years away.
At the heart of this sacred story, we proclaim that with our God the
boundaries break down. The end is never really the end. Death isn’t
final, the grave isn’t eternal, and solitude can’t even keep our God out.
With a God like this, the only reasonable thing we can do is forgive those
who sin against us and plead forgiveness when we sin against others.
With a God like ours, anything other than loving our enemy is insanity
and self-sacrifice is the only story that makes sense. But it is not easy.
I want to end with a quote from Atticus Finch that I think speaks a word
of truth today for our country and our church. Atticus is a lawyer in
Harper Lee’s classic book To Kill a Mockingbird. Finch, despite the
disapproval of the town, accepts an appointment to defend a black man 
accused of raping a white woman. The whole Alabama town takes sides
in the controversy and Atticus catches a lot of heat for his decision.
When his daughter begins to take it personally and is tempted to lash
out, Atticus tells her, “This time we aren’t fighting the Yankees, we’re
fighting our friends. But remember this, no matter how bitter things get,
they’re still our friends and this is still our home.” Amen. ",Jakob Topper,"Dallas, TX",10/23/2016,
"Okay, okay, ladies, now let’s get in formation … .
If you don’t know that phrase right away, you probably don’t have
Beyoncé on your playlist. It’s a line from her song “Formation” on the
Lemonade album. She performed it at the Super Bowl last year. And it’s
got a powerful message for women, and even more so for black women.
It’s a call to self-respect, the kind of self-respect it’s only right for
women to demand, the kind of self-respect that Michelle Obama spoke
so passionately about this week in the wake of all the despicable
language about and behavior toward women that we’ve been subjected
to of late.
There’s a triple entendre in this simple phrase by Queen Bey—let’s get
in formation. And it’s a way into our text today: I believe it speaks to
what Paul is telling to Timothy and to us today. I’ll tip my hand to you in
a way I usually don’t in my sermons. We’ll have three points in this one,
and I’ll mention them in reverse order and then take them in order.
Here you go. Last, “let’s get in formation” is marching orders. It has a
sense that we have to get together to do something important. We have
to get in formation in order to succeed in our mission. But if we’re going
to do that—and here’s the middle part, we have to get in formation, in
the sense of being formed for our work. This is about our character and
preparation. And finally first, we have to get information from
somewhere that will form us and shape us for our mission. We need
good information, the right message, the good news that will work on
us, and then through us on the church and the world.
This is Beyoncé’s big point—although you might have to do a little
cross-cultural work to get the point. Warning label if you go Googling
this: some of the lyrics are for mature audiences only, don’t you know?!
What she’s calling for, though, in ""Formation” is for women to get the
information they need about who they really are—apart from their
relationship to a man as an objectified desire, apart from standards of
beauty that are culturally callous and arbitrary. They need to internalize
that and be formed by a strong self-respect. And then they need to move 
2
out into the world to do their thing instead of waiting for someone else
to make their lives significant. It’s an anthem of resistance and selfreliance,
but it’s also grounded in a proper sense of power.
This is what the church needs today, too. We need the right information.
We need solid formation. And we need to get in formation for gospel
work in the world.
Information first, then. Paul has already told Timothy, as we saw in the
last two weeks and the last two chapters of this pastoral letter, that he
should rely upon the example of Jesus, the model of Paul’s own ministry,
and the faithful influence of Timothy’s mother and grandmother. These
are powerful saints to guide the way. But now Paul also tells him to see
scripture as a resource for his own formation for ministry.
All scripture is inspired by God, he tells Timothy. Now let’s just pause
there for a moment to think about what that means. Unfortunately, the
church has wrenched this simple and beautiful statement out of context
and made it mean what the church wanted it to mean— more than what
it should mean. In the modern era of science, when the church was
confronted with an alternative rendering of the origins of life, the
church has looked at this passage as a comprehensive statement about
the authority of the Bible over every contender for truth. If science says
the universe came into being through a Big Bang and evolved over more
than 13.9 billion years, and that the earth is about 4.5 billion years old
and that sentient human beings are the latest to have evolved—about
200,000 years ago—some Christians feel duty-bound to assert
otherwise on the basis of Genesis, because all scripture is inspired by
God. So the Bible becomes a shortcut path to truth that allows us to
bypass all other human inquiry and settle every important question of
life by appealing to what’s written on its gold-gilded pages. This is just
so unnecessary.
We’ve been fighting culture wars that have undermined the rightful role
of scripture and our faithful witness to the world. The Bible teaches us
about the who and the why of things more than the how. The Bible
guides us to understand who we are before God and in relation to all
creation. It gives us important information for our formation as
responsible creatures and partners with God in the flourishing of all
creation. 
3
Now we should also note that Paul is talking to Timothy only about
what we now know as the Old Testament. Paul didn’t know he was
writing scripture. In making this point, though, I am not trying to cast
doubt on whether the New Testament is also God-inspired; I am only
trying to remind you that any Christian’s attempt to undermine the
witness of the Hebrew Scriptures in favor of our faith over Judaism is a
nonstarter with Paul. We don’t have the Christian church today because
of the failure of Judaism; we have the Christian church today because of
the success of Judaism. Jesus was always and only a Jew. And only as a
Jew did he fully embody the God-inspired scriptures as the true word of
God. In doing so, he opened the gates of grace to Gentiles like you and
me. So we Christians are partners forever with Jews in the mission of
God to the world.
Now back to this role of scripture as information for the purpose of
formation. The information we are looking for in scripture is the script
of the drama of redemption. The story. The big good news of what God
is doing in the world from the beginning of time to the end. It’s easy to
get lost day to day in the routines of living. It’s easy to feel drawn into
the dominant culture around us. But by being students of scripture, we
internalize the script so that we can play it out on the stage of history.
This is why scripture is profitable or useful, as Paul says. It forms us to
make us capable of being the kind of people who are fit for the work
that God has for us in the world. Christians are made, not born. We have
to have our identity as children of God taught to us, and then we have to
grow into our roles in the family business. This requires that we know
some things, and it also requires that we become proficient at some
things.
Many of you know that my father was a ship pilot in New York Harbor.
He was good at it. He piloted ships as grand as the Queen Ann and the
Queen Elizabeth I and II, not to mention many cargo freighters and oil
tankers. He was one of the few pilots with a license to navigate the
difficult straits of the East River. To be honest, he was one of the few
pilots with the courage to try. But to become a proficient pilot, you need
both competence and confidence. And those are born of information and
formation—that is, of knowledge and wisdom. You have to study and
learn things that have been mapped out by others who went before you. 
4
Things like the depth of the channel and the prevailing currents. You
have to understand principles of buoyancy, weight, rudders, speed, tides
and wind, to name just a few. These things have to be embedded in your
heads: they have to be known. But they will do no good staying there as
bare facts. They need to be deployed. They need to be practiced and
honed. And so pilots not only have to pass tests to get their licenses;
they also have to ride ships with experienced pilots and learn by doing.
I might mention that this is a key to our pastoral residency program of
training gospel ministers. They have book learning from seminary, and
then they get street learning as they practice here.
All Christians need to be formed in the faith by knowing and doing. But
that formation is not just for our own sakes; it’s for the sake of our
ministry to the world. We don’t know the Bible so that we can know the
Bible. We know the Bible so that we can take our place among those
who have gone before us to live and to perform the good news of God’s
liberating work in the world through Jesus Christ. We aren’t being
trained in the faith in order to be trained in the faith; we are being
trained in the faith in order to engage successfully in our ministry in the
world. The world is too broken and too dangerous for us to play
intramurals. We have to get in the game.
That’s why Paul says that we, with Timothy, are being equipped for every
good work, to proclaim the message in season and out, to do the work of
an evangelist, and carry out our ministry fully.
This is the point where I would ask you to consider where you are in
this process. If you feel somehow that you aren’t well formed enough to
play your part in God’s work in the world, don’t fret that you aren’t
there yet. Take the next step. Timothy wasn’t fully formed, or Paul
wouldn’t have said what he did to him. Don’t focus on what’s missing in
you today; focus on what’s next for you. Learn something new every day
from the scriptures. Try something new in service. Step up to the
challenge to engage in some mission or ministry. Commit to a role on a
church committee or in a Sunday school class. Go on a mission trip.
Become involved in Christian advocacy for the hungry or homeless or
hurting in our community. Protest injustice. Promote justice. We can
help you.

World Vision is here today and throughout this week. You have already
heard about the ways this organization is at work in the world in Jesus’
name. Its members are not super-Christians doing what you cannot do
because they’re special and you’re ordinary. They’re just willing.
And look at what can happen when Christians get into formation for the
gospel. The world is crazy for war. And all the destruction our violence
does to communities and countries wreaks havoc on the human spirit.
But while the world wages war, Christians wage peace. Through World
Vision, for instance, millions of devastated and displaced people are met
with the faces of Christians who have gone into the midst of war zones
to provide temporary shelter, food and water, medicine and hope. In
places where Syrian and Iraqi refugees are huddled in camps with
millions of others, they provide child-friendly zones. In one of those in
Lebanon, a 33-year-old Syrian refugee named Mohammed has become a
healer. You can hear him before you see him, singing and leading
children to sing along.
Kathryn Reid describes what she witnessed this way: He sings in Arabic,
with pounding rhythms and bent notes like an aching cry. I didn’t know
what he was saying, but I understood everything. Mohammed’s voice was
so full of raw emotion that somehow it both soothed and stimulated the
children he was teaching. Children and adults, we felt it: joy, defiance,
heartbreak, grief. His singing said: “You’re alive. Breathe deep and know
it. It’s all right to feel even when it hurts.”
Yes, it is. Because hurt is only for now. Healing is forever. That’s the
good news. Let’s get in formation, friends. We have a gospel to proclaim. 
",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",10/16/2016,
"I know they’re only tricks, but I enjoy watching escape artists do their
thing. Harry Houdini was the most famous, of course, but nowadays
David Blaine is becoming a household name. These escapes start with
elaborate ways in which a person is bound. Houdini would be
handcuffed, wrapped in locks and chains, put into a box filled with
water, and padlocked. Somehow, nothing they did to tie him down could
keep him from escaping.
This is true of the Christian faith. The word of God is not chained, Paul
says. In fact, it is unchainable. God’s word is not bound, not hindered,
not prevented by any power in the world from doing its freeing work in
the world. God knows, though, worldly powers try.
Paul himself was imprisoned because of the word. Tyrants always
assume that if you lock away the messenger, you can mute the message,
too. Joseph Stalin mastered the horrendous art of state-sponsored
murder, trying to silence all opposition to his atheistic communist rule.
The poet Christian Wiman was with us here at Wilshire last week. He
was telling us about the Russian poet Osip Mendelstam, one of the great
but little-known minds of the 20th century. Mendelstam had converted
to Christianity, but his poetry wasn’t overtly Christian. Still, his words
were deemed a threat to the state—because the Word behind the words
is always a threat to worldly power. Stalin exiled Mendelstam and his
wife to Siberia, and no one knows exactly when or how he died. He was
last seen picking through a garbage dump, looking for scraps of food. He
suffered immensely, and yet his poetry, Wiman says, always carries an
overriding sense of joy and freedom, despite his circumstances. Stalin
was so worried about Mendelstam that he actually called the writer
Boris Pasternak to ask him whether Mendelstam was in fact a genius.
Pasternak was clever enough to know that either a yes or a no could be
deadly to him and/or Mendelstam, so he answered, That’s the wrong
question. Stalin hung up without saying a word.
The word of God is not chained. No matter the cruelty set against it, no
matter the attempts to silence it, the word of God is unfettered. It is free 
2
from worldly powers, and it frees from worldly powers.
Timothy was the young pastor of the small house churches that met in
the city of Ephesus, which is located in modern-day Turkey. Paul was his
father in ministry, his mentor and model. Timothy was apparently timid
by nature. Paul wrote to Timothy, telling him not to be afraid and to
hold fast to the unchained word of God.
Now at this point we need to say a word, as Paul did, about just what the
Word of God is. We’ve gotten into a lazy habit across the last 499 years
since the Protestant Reformation of equating the Bible with the Word of
God in an unequivocal way. When Luther protested the abuse of
authority by Church leaders in his day, he shifted authority from the
clergy to the gospel itself. Like Paul, when he said word of God, he meant
by that the good news of Jesus Christ, risen from the dead. He did not
mean a book, no matter how holy it may be. He did not mean the words
on the pages of a leather-bound edition of the New Revised Standard
Version—or even the King James Version! He meant the Word of God
that comes alive in and through those words.
Instead, though, we have begun to think of the word of God as the Bible,
plain and simple. The Bible is a vehicle that conveys the truth of God’s
word to us through words. Those words are like the mouth of the
human Jesus, through which he spoke the word of truth. To focus on the
mouth is to miss the speech that comes from it.
The Gospel writer John got it right when he talked about Jesus himself
being the word who was with God and who was God. That phrase word of
God was a Jewish way of talking about the true meaning of existence
that God communicates to us. Since the world was created in and
through the word of God, the world makes sense. When we say that God
created the world in and through the word, we are saying that the world
has meaning and purpose, and that God is always revealing that to us—
through many and varied means, but most perfectly in Jesus Christ.
Although he sometimes used the language of the word of God and the
Bible interchangeably, the British Baptist preacher of yesteryear,
Charles Haddon Spurgeon, knew the difference. He often compared the
word of God to a lion. Hear this from a sermon of his in the year 1886: A 
3
great many learned men are defending the gospel; no doubt it is a very
proper and right thing to do, yet I always notice that, when there are most
books of that kind, it is because the gospel itself is not being preached.
Suppose a number of persons were to take it into their heads that they had
to defend a lion, a full-grown king of beasts! There he is in the cage, and
here come all the soldiers of the army to fight for him. Well, I should
suggest to them, if they would not object, and feel that it was humbling to
them, that they should kindly stand back, and open the door, and let the
lion out! I believe that would be the best way of defending him, for he
would take care of himself; and the best “apology” for the gospel is to let
the gospel out. Never mind about defending Deuteronomy or the whole of
the Pentateuch; preach Jesus Christ and him crucified. Let the Lion out,
and see who will dare to approach him. The Lion of the tribe of Judah will
soon drive away all his adversaries.1
Spurgeon gets it right. He focuses on the gospel, on the Lion of the tribe
of Judah—that is, Jesus himself. This is what Paul tells Timothy:
Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David—that
is my gospel, Paul says. That is the word of God unchained—the eternal
word of God that death could not contain because the unconquerable
and incomparable life in it. That is the word that calls out to the world
about the love of God for each one of us.
This is not a word we need to defend or even try to get the powers of
the world to unchain. These days we are hearing from some about how
maligned the church in America is because we have to abide by the First
Amendment to the Constitution, which guarantees religious liberty for
all and will not permit preference and privilege for Christianity over
other religions. We have politicians making deals with preachers,
promising to take the muzzle off preachers so they can endorse
candidates and say anything they want to from the pulpit and not lose
their tax-exempt status. This is just so unwise.
I don’t wear a muzzle when I preach, except the one I put on myself—or
my wife puts on me—which is often wise, don’t you know?! I can say
anything from this pulpit I want to, but I am also accountable for what I
say—to God, to you and to our neighbors. What some preachers seem to want is the right to say things without accountability. But the gospel is
not chained by the First Amendment; in fact, the First Amendment
ensures the freedom to preach the gospel. It’s when we start trying to
advance partisan politics in the name of the gospel that we get into
trouble, and should.
If we preach the gospel and suffer for it—well, what do we expect? Paul
suffered for preaching the gospel. And the gospel itself is revealed in
suffering. You have to die to live. You can’t be raised from the dead
without dying first. When we are baptized, we are joined with Christ in
his death so that any hope of saving ourselves or of being saved by
means of worldly powers are buried in those waters. When we are
raised from the waters of baptism, we are joined with Christ in the
power of his resurrection. From then on we live by the word unchained
that is eternally free.
Only the gospel saves. The Bible doesn’t save. God saves us through the
word unchained. We preach and serve and live by a word that can’t be
muzzled or bound. That’s what we believe and proclaim—Christ, and
him crucified. We need no help from government to do so. And if we try
to get government to help, we actually put shackles on our witness. We
are first and last gospel partisans. We are doves more than donkeys or
elephants. We serve the Prince of Peace, whose kingdom is not of this
world, but to whom all the kingdoms of this world will one day bow.
So with Paul we endure everything for the sake of this gospel. And that
also means that we don’t get bogged down in wrangling over words, as
Paul put it. The heretics in Ephesus were Gnostics who believed that
there were secret meanings in words that they could interpret because
they had special knowledge. But Paul is saying that we need to explain
the word of truth as skilled workers who keep their ears tuned to the
Word in the words.
Sometimes the church gets bogged down in disputes over interpretation
of the Bible. Both those from the left and those from the right both get
drawn into this. And the end is ruin. We miss the forest for the trees. We
miss the music for the notes. We miss the dance for the steps. The Bible
invites us to hear the word of God in the words. It points beyond itself to
the God who speaks to us through it. The Bible has a pulse: it beats to the heart of God.
Every dispute over words in the church should be settled by asking if we
hear the heartbeat of God in our interpretation. Does the way we read
the words liberate or enslave? Does it sound like the good news that
gives us hope or hopelessly confines us to ourselves? Does it lead us to a
deeper community with everyone for whom Christ died, or only to those
who think like we do?
Finally, this: the word of God endures forever, and that means that we
can endure whatever challenges come to us in our time.
When they began working on the movie Ben Hur, the director, Cecil B.
DeMille, talked to Charlton Heston, the star of the movie, about the allimportant
chariot race at the end. He decided that Heston should learn
to drive the chariot himself rather than using a stunt double. Learning to
drive a chariot with horses four abreast, however, was no small feat.
After days of practice, Heston returned to the set and reported to
DeMille: I think I can drive the chariot all right, Cecil, but I’m not at all
sure I can actually win the race. Smiling slyly, DeMille replied, Heston,
you just stay in the race, and I’ll make sure you win.2
Because the word of God is unchained, we don’t have to worry about
results. We just have to stay the course. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",10/9/2016,
"Sometimes we make too much of the differences between the culture of
ancient times and today’s. There are differences, for sure. Rome had an
emperor, while most monarchs we have left in the world today are
figureheads, with political power now diffused among the people.
Women were considered the property of their husbands back then, just
a notch above slaves, while today whatever remnants of those
hierarchies still exist are generally considered morally wrong. Children
weren’t cherished then the way they are today, as their significance was
more about the legacy of the family than who they were themselves.
But these differences are more degree than kind. If we have eyes to see,
we can spot in our passage from 2 Timothy how we continue to wrestle
with some of the same issues. The church struggled then and struggles
now to find its place in a society that values strength and power more
than anything else, and this is more or less tied to lingering notions of
honor and shame.
Listen to how this comes through in the text. Timothy was Paul’s
younger protégé with the churches in Ephesus. It was hard going. In a
Roman culture, being successful and respectable was everything, and
yet the churches were small, and they mostly met in the houses of
wealthy widows. The new religion worshipped a savior who was
shamefully crucified as a criminal, and the foremost apostle of the
church—Paul—had also been a prisoner. Suffering was a sign of divine
disfavor. It proved a person’s unworthiness. No respectable Roman
would willingly sign on to a life characterized by weakness or shame.
Timothy’s courage was apparently flagging. Paul had to remind him that
God did not give us a spirit of cowardice, but rather of power and of love
and of self-discipline. He went on to tell him not to be ashamed of the
gospel or oof Paul’s having been a prisoner. Instead he urged him to lean
in and accept that this was the revolution that God was bringing about
in Christ Jesus, one that would transform the world from the bottom up.
This is the reason why God sent Jesus to be among us as a human being
who endured shame and death. He removed the stigma that attaches to 
2
the loser and the failure, the low-brow and the low-born, the has-been
and the never-was.
But this view is hard to accept even today. Our culture has made great
progress in human rights and in understanding the mysteries of nature.
Yet we still value success and power so highly that values like these
become calling cards for us in social settings and qualifications for
public office. We still too often think that honor is attached to wealth
and beauty and youth, to intelligence and athleticism and heritage, to
achievement and fame and self-esteem—and shame to their opposites.
The church is still struggling with its place in the world, trying
sometimes to argue for power and prestige in worldly terms that seems
odd when we consider what our text is saying to us. Some Christians
today consider the church weak if we do not achieve worldly power.
They read a passage like this about God not giving us a spirit of
cowardice, but of power, and they think that means we need to assert
ourselves boldly and to claim our place among the strong.
For instance, one local Baptist preacher has recently said, I am getting
sick and tired of these namby-pamby, panty-waisted, weak-kneed
Christians.1 He wants a manlier Christianity and a more militant faith
that conquers culture and takes control of the public square for God.
Another form of this faith involves those who believe that God has
secretly anointed some special Christians to be in charge of the world in
the seven mountains of culture—family, religion, education, media,
entertainment, business and government. They are to rule the world
until Christ returns victorious at the Second Coming to reward the
righteous and to condemn sinners.
This is not what Paul is calling Timothy to, and it’s not what God is
calling the church to today. It’s a misunderstanding of our faith and
witness. The way Christ defeated the powers of sin and death and
brought immortality to light was through the gospel. And the gospel
works by subversion—subverting the powers of the world by refusing
to play according to their rules. Salvation comes through suffering on behalf of the lowly, not through success by lauding it over the lowly. God
vindicated Jesus and raised him from the dead on account of his selfsacrificial
life of love.
Jesus redefined courage as the power of love, not the love of power. He
called us to love power, not to love power. Love, not power, is the proper
noun of Christian faith. Said another way, love qualifies power instead of
power qualifying love. Love is willing to suffer on behalf of others in
order to demonstrate its power to redeem. Power is willing to make
others suffer in order to prove its superiority to them.
Real courage is the power to endure suffering out of love, not the
capacity to defeat others by force of power. This is where self-discipline
comes in. God has given us a spirit of love and power and self-discipline.
We discipline ourselves to exercise power in the service of love, not the
other way ’round.
And if you think of it this way, the question, then, is where you learn this
kind of love power. Paul begins by telling Timothy to fan into flame the
faith that was first in his grandmother, Lois, and then also in his mother,
Eunice. In other words, he turns to the women of Timothy’s family as
models of what kind of faith he should exercise. This is exactly contrary
to anything that would have seemed laudable in the ancient world,
where masculine virtues were superior to feminine ones. But maternal
strength is hardly namby-pamby, panty-waisted or weak-kneed. It’s a
love power that begins with enduring the pain of childbirth, continues
with the letting go of weaning, and never ceasing in prayer and love. If
motherhood represents weakness to the world that is passing away,
then it’s the kind of weakness that God sees as strength for the world
that is coming to be.
I was with Tony Campolo a couple of weeks ago. He’s a well-known and
highly respected inspirational speaker. His wife, Peggy, stayed home to
raise their two kids while he traipsed around the world speaking. On the
rare occasions when she did travel with him, she often found herself in
conversations with some of the most accomplished, impressive,
influential, sophisticated people in the world. 
4
After one such trip, Peggy confided in Tony that she sometimes found
herself intimidated and questioning her self-worth. Tony suggested that
she come up with something she could say when she met such people
that would let them know how she valued her role. Not long after that,
when the Campolos were at a party, a woman said to Peggy in a
condescending tone, Well, my dear, what do you do?
Tony heard his wife say, I am nurturing two Homo Sapiens into the
dominant values of the Judaeo-Christian tradition in order that they might
become instruments for the transformation of the social order into the
kind of eschatological utopia God envisioned from the beginning of time.
The other woman said: O, my, I’m just a lawyer.
Motherhood is a powerful job that God uses to shape the love power of
Christians in the world. Timothy was called to remember and draw
upon that female family faith when he was feeling shamed by the power
values of the world or intimidated into thinking himself insignificant.
That’s not to say that men and fatherhood aren’t important, too, but the
point is that women as well as men have a capacity to teach their
children what it means to be Christian leaders. Women’s Lives Matter,
don’t you know?!
The larger point is to point to the role of the family itself in Christian
formation. I’m afraid that this is sometimes as neglected today as well as
it was then. We have a way of outsourcing and delegating too much in
our parenting. We want teachers and role models for our children in
school and church, and we forget that we are the first line of faith
development for them.
The difference in whether a child learns and achieves in school often
comes down to how involved the parents are. Do they model reading
and self-discipline for their children? Do they read to their children
when they are young and set high standards for them? It’s the same
with spiritual education. Shall we neglect to model Christian practices of
prayer and worship, generosity and service? Ask yourself: What kind of
Christian will my children be if we as parents are their primary role
models of faith? Would someone be able to say to them, as Paul did to 
5
Timothy, in a crucial time of self-doubt in life, to remember the faith of
your parents and grandparents? Will they have a legacy of faith that
they can fan into flame when the going gets tough?
This is a resource I have because of my parents’ faith and faithfulness.
To be able to honor and not shame the faith of my parents is a rich and
important gift, and I hope it’s something my children and grandchildren
can say about Kim and me as well.
But the church also plays a key role. Paul told Timothy to also
remember the gifts that were his through the laying on hands by the
church. The family and the church are the two spheres of influence that
shape the faith lives of the next generation.
This is one reason we make a conscious effort in the faith formation of
children from birth onward. We don’t see it as our job to entertain
children at church. They have plenty of that in the rest of their lives. And
when they are youth, it’s not all fun and games. It’s about teaching them
to be still and know that God is God. It’s about building into them an
awareness of who they are as children of God. It’s about teaching them
that the main purpose of their life is to serve and glorify God with the
gifts that are given to them.
That also involves spotting those like Timothy, who have gifts for
serving the church. Our ministers and Sunday school teachers keep an
eye out for those who show a keen interest in spiritual things. And we
tell them when we see that in them.
Our pastoral-residency program is the icing on the cake, through which
we train young ministers for service. I was moved by the testimony of
our newest residents at deacons’ meeting last week. They said how
honored they were to be among us during this time. They named the
challenge they see the church going through now in our inclusion-anddiversity
discernment. They don’t need us to be a conflict-free zone in
order to learn the love power of ministry. They need us to be the kind of
people who persevere together in seeking the will of God and honoring
one another as we do. 
6
The church is a laboratory of learning that allows us to prepare for our
life in the world. If we are faithful to God and to each other when times
are tough, we will give young people the resources they need to be
faithful to God and one another when their turn comes.
If the church is in love with power, we have little to offer them that the
world doesn’t have. But if the church practices the power of love, the
world will have a witness to the saving grace of Christ that endures
forever and ever. Amen. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",10/2/2016,
"Preachers and scholars don’t always agree—a bit like pastors and
parishioners, don’t you know?! But we have long agreed that this
story Jesus tells of the dishonest manager is “the hardest parable.”
Now, it may be hard to apply to our lives, but many things Jesus
tells us are hard in that way. Mark Twain once said: It ain’t those
parts of the Bible I don’t understand that bother me, it’s the parts I
do understand. I think we can all agree with that. We’re really
good at modifying Jesus to take the edge off what he says— like
the part about selling all you have and giving it to the poor, or the
part about loving your enemies and doing good to those who hate
you, or the part about forgiving seventy times seven times. Yes,
we understand what he’s saying there, but we would rather not
follow him all the way on those things.
Tony Campolo, who teaches sociology at Eastern University in
Philadelphia, spoke at the New Baptist Covenant summit in
Atlanta this week. He recalled a day a father brought his collegegraduate
son into his office and started blaming Campolo for his
son’s misuse of his college degree by working with the poor
instead of making a decent living like any self-respecting middleclass
kid should do with his American ambition. The father
declared: Don’t get me wrong, I’m okay with Christianity … up to a
point. Yeah, we all have our point, don’t we? The point beyond
which we don’t want to go with Jesus.
That might also be true with this parable, but before we get there,
just understanding the point is hard, period. For instance, if you
treat it as an allegory and not a parable, where all its figures
represent someone in the divine drama, it may seem that God is
the rich man who will judge us for our bad stewardship and fire
us off to hell for our sins, only to give us a break if we double
down on our self-interested dishonesty. This seems like a bad
example for the children. How are we going to teach good morals
if we follow Jesus’ wisdom about selfish, conniving people getting 
2
rewarded in the end?
The first thing to say is that we should look for the forest in the
trees, not the trees in the forest. That is, parables make one big
point overall. And most commentators and preachers fall into two
categories of interpretation on this parable: it’s about forgiveness
or money.
If it’s about forgiveness, the parable makes sense in that it follows
the parable of the Prodigal Son. In both cases there came a time of
reckoning for the sins of the central character. Both the prodigal
son and the dishonest manager were trying to figure out a way to
secure a welcome for themselves in some home after becoming
aware that the jig was up on their profligate ways.
In the Prodigal Son story, the forgiveness flows downward from
the father to the son without any merit on the son’s part, except
his coming empty-handed and without excuse—Just as I am
without one plea, right? In the case of the dishonest steward, it
flows upward, so to speak: his debts are forgiven only after he
forgives the debts of his debtors. Sounds like the Lord’s Prayer,
doesn’t it? Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
The point is that if we want to be welcomed by God into an eternal
home in heaven someday, we’d better get started now on earth by
forgiving others, or we may not be forgiven ourselves.
Okay, so there’s something there, but also something troubling.
Hold on and let’s see what the second interpretation looks like.
This view is all about the Benjamins, as they say. It’s about
money—how we misuse it for evil and may reuse it for good.
On the side of this view, Jesus does say something peculiar about
using dishonest wealth to buy friends, whatever that means. And
he does say at the end of the passage that we can’t serve both God
and mammon. What’s more, the very next verse—we didn’t
read—has Luke telling us that the Pharisees were upset with
Jesus’ teaching because they were lovers of money. On top of that,
Jesus goes on to tell the parable of the rich fool a few verses later.
(More on that next week.) So it could be that this parable should 
3
be matched with that one instead of the Prodigal Son, which
comes before it. If that’s the case, we should read it as a warning
against greed and lack of care about the poor and hungry.
I remember that one of my preacher heroes, Cecil Sherman, used a
passage like this to justify talking straight to people in the church
about tithing. He said that how we handle our money is tied to our
eternal salvation. Here’s his line: I consider it my spiritual duty to
deliver people from that which if held too tightly would send them
straight to hell. Nice, huh? Maybe we could make up our budget
deficit this morning if we just pass those plates again after the
sermon. Ushers?
But here’s problem with that interpretation, and it’s also one of
the problems with the forgiveness angle: it turns salvation into
something we do to earn God’s acceptance. We may be
scoundrels, but before it’s too late, we ought to start making
amends somehow—whether by showing mercy to people or by
giving away our money to good causes, so that God will be
impressed with our sincerity and let us into heaven when we die.
This isn’t far off from the way the church functioned for centuries.
In addition, for ages the Mafia has abused and terrified ordinary
people, extorted small businesses and trafficked in criminal
behavior of all kinds. Then they give dishonest wealth to the
church in order to buy forgiveness. One writer said, For years
many priests have been happy to allow the Mafia to dress
themselves up as upstanding members of communities.1 Even
worse, it seems that the Vatican Bank has laundered money for
the mob in order to enrich itself. No more. The unflappable Pope
Francis has gone to Sicily, into the heart of Mafia influence, and
made it clear that cheating the poor and mistreating the
vulnerable would result in excommunication from the church.
There will be no buying salvation through donation for those who
practice extortion.
We can say the same for payday lenders, who abuse the poor and entrap them in debt. The same goes for politicians who take the
money of these predators to buy legislative influence. It also
applies to payday lenders who give ill-gotten gains to charity.
Don’t use Jesus to justify injustice.
One payday lender, Phil Locke, who had started a small company
named Cash Now, got out of the business a few years ago and
became an informant, trying to reform the industry. He called his
partners some of the greediest people he had ever known, so he
sold most of his possessions and seemed to find religion. Most
people didn’t take his conversion seriously. They didn’t believe he
had really seen the light. And indeed he eventually went back into
the business. He hadn’t sold his stake in the business at all; he had
transferred it to his mother. His wife missed the trappings of the
life they had gotten accustomed to. And so had he. I gave it a shot
just to see what I could do, Locke [said]. It didn’t work out. I had to
return home.2
Here’s the problem with that, according to Jesus: by returning
home to a lifestyle built on mammon that always abuses others to
enrich yourself, you will never enter into an eternal home.
Judgment is coming.
So if it’s not about forgiveness or money per se, even if there are
implications for both of those things, what is this parable about?
Enlightened self-interest, I would say.
I know when I use the word enlightened these days, it raises the
cackles of some people because it’s tied to a kind of arrogance of
those who think they are more knowledgeable about things than
those who cling to tradition. It’s usually thought of as referring to
so-called progressive educated elites who look down on
conservatives they think are unthinking, prejudiced and
backward. You can just about summarize one theme of our
current presidential campaign that way. And it isn’t hard for that
sort of thinking to invade the church. I have been accused lately of just such a spirit. And if I harbor it, I should be judged for it,
because as the moral philosopher Immanuel Kant once said,
Excess of light blinds, too.
You can be blind because you won’t come out of the darkness into
the light, and you can be blind because you are looking straight
into the sun. One side doesn’t have a copyright on arrogance,
though; and neither does one side have a purchase on humility.
Progressives, even in the church, should embrace enduring things;
and conservatives should remember that God is not finished
shaping the world or the church into more equitable, just and
merciful ways of living.
Still, Jesus called on children of the light to be as shrewd in dealing
with their own eternal interests as those of the world are in
dealing with temporal interests. Self-interest doesn’t have to be
selfish. This is the key to understanding the parable.
The phrase enlightened self-interest means that individuals or
groups that act in the interest of others will turn out benefiting
themselves by their generosity. Doing well can be rightly judged
only by doing good. And that means doing good toward your
neighbor.
The problem with so much of our society these days is that we
think we are in zero-sum culture wars. We think there’s only so
much freedom or prosperity to go around, so we have to get ours,
regardless of what happens to our neighbors. Jesus’ parable
teaches us to have a more enlightened, spiritual, communityoriented,
neighbor-focused view of things. It’s not for charitable
reasons that you give to others—whether forgiveness or money—
in order to impress God and secure your place in an eternal home.
It’s about living according to the rule of grace. That is the way God
has designed the world in the first place, and it will be the only
way the world to come will operate.
The reason the rich man in the parable is pleased with the shrewd
manager in the end is the same reason he is upset with him in the
beginning: he doesn’t value things the way everyone else in the 
6
story does. The rich man wasn’t concerned with how much was
his; he was concerned with the injustice toward others that was
being done in his name. He was angry that the manager didn’t
trust him to take good care of him, which led the man to cheat him
by overcharging his customers. The customers paid only what
they thought they owed, but they were being cheated, too. When
the manager finally cuts their debts, he’s realizing for the first
time that he is a debtor along with them.
Listen, my dear people: The church is secure only when we realize
that the church doesn’t belong to us; we are stewards of it only for
a time. We all belong to God, and God wants us to count ourselves
among the debtors who are saved by grace—and grace alone.
Kayla McClurg puts it this way: Instead of trying to prove how
wronged we have been or how righteous we are, we can be like the
manager and get busy using our talents in new ways. Jesus
calls those who have benefited from the influence of the powerful to
turn now to making friends among the least. Whatever we have,
whether honorably or illicitly gained, we can use it to build up a
new kind of community—not achievers, but debtors all. Among the
dismissed and the dispossessed, we will find our true home.3
Only there, friends. Only there. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",9/18/2016,
"Do you remember where you were 15 years ago today? For those of us
who are old enough, we remember the day the Japanese bombed Pearl
Harbor or the day President Kennedy was shot in Dallas or the day
Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated or Bobby Kennedy was killed or
the Challenger exploded.
Most of us remember 9/11 like it was yesterday—the day a group of
radical Islamic terrorists flew hijacked planes into the Twin Towers in
New York, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and a field in Pennsylvania.
In every case, our first reaction was shock and grief. But right behind
that were anger and a desire for revenge. We wanted those perpetrators
caught. We wanted them pursued and killed. We wanted justice in every
case, but it became hard to distinguish justice from revenge.
What has our 15-year find-and-destroy campaign wrought? We have
seen nothing but an escalation of hatred and death, a growing threat of
terrorism and perpetual fear of others who look like they could be
terrorists, whether there is any good reason to believe that or not. At
our best, we look upon misguided and lost souls as pure evil, along with
everyone who looks like them, worships like them and cheered them on.
In doing so, we have forgotten just how much hatred and lostness exist
within each of us and how different God’s way of dealing with us in
Jesus Christ has been.
I am reminded of the story of the teacher who asked her primary school
class one day: If all the bad children were painted red and all the good
children were painted green, which color would you be? After a long
pause, a little boy piped up and said: Striped. And he’s right, of course.
We are all striped; we are all beloved children of God who are dreadfully
lost sinners at the same time.
Jesus tells three parables in Luke 15: the lost sheep, the lost coin and the
lost son. We commonly call the last one the parable of the prodigal son,
and we’ll have to save that for another day. But the first two that we 
2
look at today set us up to understand that one rightly.
Too often we have read these parables in a way that misses the point. I
want to suggest to you that the point of the parables is in the conclusion
of each one: that there is great joy in heaven over those who were lost
and are found. But most of us instead have read these parables as
stories of repentance … as we understand repentance. Which is almost
always about the repentance of other people, don’t you know?!
We think we are the safe ones—like the ninety-nine sheep or the nine
coins. We are doing all the right things for God. The one sheep that
wanders off and the one coin that has somehow slipped away are the
random sinners out there who are not like us. And when we read these
parables that way, we miss so much of what Jesus is trying to teach us
about true joy.
So let’s take a fresh look at these parables. The setting is Jesus
consorting with tax collectors and sinners. They are drawn to him, his
welcome of them, his love for them, his simple being with them as they
are. And when he does consort with them, the insiders—the Pharisees
in Jesus’ day and good church folk in our day like us—begin to grumble
about his inappropriate attention to them and identification with them.
Let’s just state the obvious: You can’t feel joy when you are busy
grumbling. Let’s try for a moment, shall we? I want you to think right
now about something that seems wrong to you: unjust, cruel, painful or
bitter. You may need to put a face to it. (Shouldn’t be hard these days.)
Now, listen to the angels singing for joy in heaven. Are you feeling it? Of
course not. Your heart can’t enjoy a party that your mind won’t let you
attend. You can’t celebrate the good news of God in Jesus Christ if you
take the role of those who want to tell Jesus what he should do and not
do. Joy is what you know when you join Jesus in his mission of seeking
and saving the lost.
So here we have a shepherd who finds that one of his sheep has
wandered off. Notice that the sheep was already the property of the
shepherd. Likewise, the coin that is lost is the property of the woman.
When the sheep wanders off, it still is included. When the coin is lost, it
is still included. Lostness is not about exclusion from God; it’s about 
3
losing the experience of knowing who you really are to God.
These parables show us that from the point of view of Jesus, inclusion is
the starting point, not the ending point. The shepherd does not have a
flock of 99 sheep and want to get one more to bring in to make a total of
100. The woman does not have nine coins and want one more to make
10.
In 1947 the Norwegian explorer and ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl
conducted an extraordinary experiment called the Kon-Tiki expedition.
Heyerdahl believed that South Americans could have reached Polynesia
and that their cultures could have influenced one another even before
Columbus sailed for the new world. So he constructed a raft made only
of Peruvian native materials available in pre-Columbian times. He made
a raft from balsa logs, modeled after illustrations made by Spanish
conquistadores. Heyerdahl and five companions set out on what would
be a successful 101-day, 4,300-mile journey. They had little chance to
steer their raft and were subject to the winds and waves that threatened
the raft at every moment. If something fell overboard, there was no way
of going after it, since they couldn’t slow the raft down to reclaim it.
That included people.
Two months into the voyage, Herman Watzinger lost his footing and fell
overboard. The crew was frightened as they saw the raft drifting away
from him so fast that he couldn’t swim to catch up. They kept trying to
throw him the lifeline, but the wind kept blowing it back. Finally, Knut
Haugland tied the lifebelt around his waist and dived into the water. He
swam to Herman and threw his arms around him, and the crew pulled
both men back to the raft.
When I think of this story, I think about the shepherd who leaves the 99
and goes to find the lost sheep, and the woman who leaves the nine
coins and goes to find the lost one. And I think about the God who leaves
the angels in heaven and goes to save the lost of the earth by sending us
Jesus to be the savior of the world.
What Jesus does is model for us the heart of God that isn’t striped. God
sends Jesus to seek and to save the lost, not to huddle up safely with the
found to show us how to keep ourselves safe. And in doing so, he 
4
identifies with the lost, because that is actually the whole world,
including those of us who have forgotten our lostness. He accepts that
his reputation among the holy will be tarnished by consorting with
sinners and loving them unconditionally. He understands his mission
this way, and he gives himself up on the cross for us all.
This story Luke tells us about Jesus’ parables is not simply a record of
what Jesus told the religious insiders that day who were grumbling
about his outreach to sinners. The story was meant to be a reminder to
the church then and now, including the church that says its mission is to
build a community of faith shaped by the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The
mission of the church is not to protect ourselves against sinners or to
keep ourselves from them, because this would always mean that we
would fail, since we are all striped by good and evil: we are all of us
sinners always. We are never not sinners, no matter how saintly we
seem.
The only way we can fulfill our mission as a church is to be on the
search-and-recover mission of Jesus rather than the search- and-destroy
mission or the stay- safe-and-guard-the-homeland mission we prefer.
We have good news to share with sinners, but they will never hear it
from us if they think we are condescendingly telling them that if they
would only do what we have done and become like us, then we would
welcome them because then God will have welcomed them. If you want
to know the reason so many young people don’t give a fig about church
these days, that’s it. They think that we are hypocrites who spend all our
time deciding how to protect ourselves and our community of holiness
against anyone who would threaten it because of their sinner status.
And all the while they know what we won’t admit about ourselves:
namely, that we are as lost as they are, even if we are insiders in the
church and they are outsiders.
My great-grandfather on my father’s side worked on the water like my
father and grandfather. He came over from Great Britain and worked on
a ship. He died on a dock in New York. He was probably drunk one
night—as so many sailors were back then—when he must have slipped
between some loose boards on a pier and fell under. He was probably
knocked unconscious and was wedged between some pilings for about 
5
two weeks before they found him, because his fingernails had grown out
that much. He officially drowned without ever leaving the dock.
Listen, Christians can be lost without ever leaving the church. I believe
that these parables of Jesus are less about the supposed sinners than the
supposed saints. They focus on the church that has forgotten its own
lostness and its mission to seek and to save.
Did you notice that when the shepherd finds the sheep, he doesn’t go
back to the fold of 99, and when the woman finds the coin, she doesn’t
put it back in the coin box with the other nine? In both cases they call
together their friends to celebrate with them. I’m thinking that the
reason is that the 99 sheep and the nine coins, if they represent the
church—as I believe they do—have forgotten how to celebrate salvation
because they have forgotten how to admit their own lostness.
But what of repentance, you may be asking? Isn’t repentance the key to
joy? This is where we go wrong.
How does a sheep repent? How does a coin repent? When we make the
story about repentance as we understand repentance, we miss the joy
that God wants us to experience and that Jesus invites us to know.
Repentance is not as much about feeling sorry for our sins as it is about
agreeing with God about who we really are. When we repent, we
acknowledge our lostness and celebrate our being found. We do not
confess our sins in order to warrant forgiveness and acceptance into the
fold. We confess that we belong to God and begin to live again as
children of God.
When you break it down, the anatomy of joy is in being found and in
finding others who are as lost as we know ourselves to be. Joy comes
from being in the arms of a God who celebrates over every lost sinner
who is saved—including us. The alternative is to stay where we are and
as we are and to grumble over God’s joy in saving sinners.
I don’t know about you, but I want to share in God’s joy. Amen.",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",9/11/2016,
"Living in Houston these past eight years, I was surrounded by engineers.
Civil engineers, mechanical engineers, petroleum engineers…in fact, this
past summer, my old Children’s Minister was a former NASA Aeronautical
Engineer and my intern was a Petroleum Engineer turned Youth Intern. If
you ever feel like you are the smartest person in the room, go try to plan a
mission trip or a retreat with a bunch of engineers. And, if you ARE an
engineer, please take it easy on us poor Liberal Arts majors. We get it.
Your people built the pyramids, our people wrote about the pyramids.
Out of curiosity a few years ago, I decided to take a Project Management
course through AMA, the American Management Association. When we
shared what we did professionally, I got the strangest looks from the crowd.
“What are YOU doing here? Don’t you just study the Bible?” Nevertheless,
we had a great three-day conference together, and I learned something
very important about being a minister, about being a follower of Jesus,
really, about being a human: you have to count the cost. Those brilliant
engineers from my church who, after presenting something, would pepper
me with questions about “Risks” and “Known Unknowns” and ask things
like “Have you talked to all the Stakeholders?”
While I was at the conference, like Paul on the road to Damascus, scales
fell from my eyes. I realized that whenever I presented an idea to my
volunteers in a committee meeting, or to the deacons, all the questions
peppering me were an effort to understand and uncover. These dear
engineer friends of mine weren’t being contrarian or dismissive of my ideas. They were using their gifts to produce the best idea possible. Just like I was
trained in Divinity School to look for meaning in the mundane and wrestle
with ancient symbols and texts of Christian faith, they were trained to ask
the right questions. To assess risk. To count the cost.
Our text today takes a dark turn as Jesus offers his followers the wash-out
course in Christianity. Just like a freshman in college taking pre-med who
cares more about prestige than the practice of medicine, Jesus throws his
disciples into the deep end. Note, Luke tells us Jesus is being followed by a
“large crowd,” not just a small merry band of dense disciples. No, Jesus
has accumulated some popularity. He’s kind of a big deal in Palestine. So,
he turns and shoots straight with the crowd.
“Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and
children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my
disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross and follow me cannot be my
disciple.”
In the American landscape of mega-churches, this probably strikes us as a
peculiar church growth strategy. “Umm, Jesus, wouldn’t it be easier to
promise people their best life now, or attack some group of people who are
different? Just pick a people group and make them the enemy, Jesus!
Come on people, love an enemy! Why do you think we love Rocky IV so
much? America versus the Russians! Who doesn’t want to root for the
home team? But, now you are telling us our parents, our brothers and sisters, our wives
and husbands, even our own flesh and blood…THEY are the enemy?”
To absorb the peculiarity of this declaration, we need a little history lesson.
In a world where you can log on, plug in, and check out, it’s easy to find
commonalities with people around the globe. Whatever silly hobby, odd job,
or bizarre interest you have, you can find someone on the internet with
whom to share kinship. Do you like dressing in a Scottish kilt and flipping
gigantic logs? You can join the Highland Games just up the road in
Addison, and do all the caber tossing and stone putting your little heart can
handle! Do you love dressing up like a zombie roaming the streets? Well,
just around the corner is the annual Halloween Zombie Walk through Oak
Lawn! Admission is free, but brains are not included.
The Internet has enabled us to find each other in a way that is unparalleled
in human history. This was not so in Jesus’ day.
There was really only one thread that sewed society together in those days:
blood. National identity rooted in the nuclear family was about all there was.
You couldn’t trust outsiders. You couldn’t trust people who spoke different
languages, or looked different, or ate different foods, or worshipped
different gods. The world was divided into pure and polluted. And, for Jesus
and his fellow Jewish kindred, Gentiles were polluted. They ate disgusting foods, they did disgusting things with their bodies, and they did disgusting
things before their gods. Jewish purity maps specified who was in and who
was out, and let me tell you, if Jesus’ people were pure, the Gentiles to
whom Paul carried the Gospel were as polluted as they come.
Keeping to yourself and protecting your family was necessary for survival.
The way I have heard it summed: “I don’t care about nobody but me and
mine.” Familial protectionism was the social safety net of the day.
Not only was your family your source of safety and security in this life, but
also the next. Not until the Intertestamental period, the time between the
Old and New Testaments, did Jewish theologians begin to discover a
concept of the afterlife. In Jewish theology in the Old Testament, once you
die, you are gone, and your family exists beyond your death as your means
to immortality. Your family means your name might live on for generations
to come. So, when God comes to Abram in Genesis 12 and says, “I want to
bless you. I want to give you more children than there are stars in the
Heavens” God is not just saying “I want you to have a ton of dependents.”
God is saying “I want to give you a future. I don’t want you to be washed
away into the nothingness of death. I want every generation from now until
eternity to remember your name, Abraham, because I want to make one
human family out of you.” In the Kingdom of God, there is a reorganizing of the family unit, and in the
New Testament Church, we see a group of people bound not by blood, but
by the Holy Spirit.
I first met Pravash during a 10- week mission trip to India when I was in
college. This was my first time to fly by myself, to fly overseas, and to be
gone for longer than seven days. We flew first into New Delhi for
orientation, then just a few days later my team of ten and I were twisting
and turning up tiny roads in the Himalayan Foothills until we arrived in
Darjeeling. Darjeeling was a favorite vacation spot for the Brits during the
days of the Empire. The British Imperialists loved the cold, rainy climate
and the city sat at such a high altitude, the streets were filled with clouds
reminding them of the London fog.
We spent the next nine weeks hiking through the Himalayas, stopping in
small villages every night, sleeping wherever we could find, and eating
whatever we were served. We were hiking higher and higher towards the
Nepali border and occasionally we would ask our guide, Amar, like little
kids in the back seat on their way to Disney World, “How much longer,” and
Amar would just reply, “Mati! Mati!” This was Nepali for “Up! Up!” which is
the least helpful measurement of time on an eight- hour hike.
We arrived at what turned out to be a small fort with no more than six
soldiers guarding the Nepali border to protect India from any Maoist
invasions. It was pretty clear immediately that these guys were NOT the Delta Force of the Indian Military. They allowed us to bunk down for the
night. One of our team members, came back after disappearing for quite
some time with one of our translators, and a soldier named Pravash.
Pravash began to tell us his story. How he had heard the Gospel years ago
from a Nepali Pastor in a small village, how he told his parents he wanted
to become a follower of Jesus, and how they threatened to disown him if he
converted. And yet, this soldier guarding the middle of nowhere in the
Himalayas prayed to begin his journey with Christ. Pravash finished by
saying, “I do not know what my family will do, but I do not care. I want to
follow Jesus.”
Pravash asked the questions. Pravash assessed the risk. Pravash counted
the cost.
“For which of you intending to build a tower does not first sit down and
estimate the cost to see whether you have enough to complete it? Or what
king, going out to wage war against another king, will not sit down first and
consider whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one who
comes against him with twenty thousand?”
Jesus talks a great deal about the Kingdom. Most of his parables are about
God’s reign on earth as it is in heaven, in fact. One of the strengths of using
this language “Kingdom of God” is that it reminds us just who is in charge.
God is the Sovereign Monarch over all God surveys, right? As important as
this regal, governmental language is to our understanding of God’s activity in the world, it does lack the intimate emphasis on family that we see and
hear over and over again in the New Testament.
“Brothers, Sisters…”
“Our Father who art in Heaven…”
“Like a mother hen gathering her chicks under her wings…”
I wonder what insights we might gain into our relationship to God and each
other if we just dropped the “G” out of “Kingdom” when we say Kingdom of
God. The Kin-dom of God. What if we slowed down and soaked in the
thought that if God is the parent, we are all the kids? If God cares for us like
our fathers and mothers in this life, then… we are all one big family. But
what if our fathers and mothers have not shown us what it means to love
ourselves, our neighbors or our enemies? What if our fathers and mothers
passed down to us a worldview of hate, racism, prejudice, self-loathing,
violence, abuse…how are we to follow our family who turns so far away
from the Good News of God’s Love? Jesus says, turn away and follow him.
Our kinship ties come not by the blood of familial and national identity, but
by the blood of Christ shed in non-violent protest against the powers of
hate and violence in this world…this world…where violence is so often the
answer because people are unwilling or unable to ask the questions that
lead to peace. We are unwilling or unable to ask the questions that lead to justice. We must ask these questions, my friends. We must assess the risk.
We must count the cost.
And building the Kingdom is a COSTLY project.
Bringing the Kingdom on Earth as it is in Heaven is a great feat of spiritual
dreaming and ethical engineering, and if we don’t consider the cost, we
might fail. But thanks be to God, for it is not on any ONE of our shoulders,
but together as the Family of God do we construct and herald in the Kindom.
So, what if Dad doesn’t want to help? What if Mom doesn’t care about
the cost? Jesus says, I have made for you a new family.
Brothers and Sisters, we are the Family of God for each other in this place.
Let us love each other like Christ has taught us for the Kinship of the
Kingdom is at hand. Amen.",Kevin Sinclair,"Dallas, TX",9/4/2016,
"On March 2, 1962, one of the greatest basketball games of all time
was played. Wilt Chamberlin of the Philadelphia Warriors was
having the night of his life. Wilt, as I’m sure most of you know, was
one of the most dominant basketball players to step onto the court.
He was 7’ 1” tall and unlike other seven-footers who were only on
the court because of their size, Wilt could move as gracefully as a
ballerina, scoring at will when guarded by two and sometimes
three opponents.
But Wilt had one glaring weakness, he was a horrible free-throw
shooter. This made him an absolute liability on the court. In the
final minutes of a close game, all the other team had to do was to
foul Wilt because they knew that he would miss the free throws
and they would get the ball back. This was such a big deal that his
coach once told him, “Wilt, if you could shoot free throws, we might
never lose.”
In the 1961-62 season, this all changed. Wilt, began to shoot his
free throws underhanded, and he became a good free throw
shooter. And on March 2nd, he was a great free-throw shooter. Wilt
scored over 100 points that night and made 28 of 32 free throws.
That’s still the most free-throws that anyone has ever made in a
single basketball game. Wilt Chamberlain fixed his weakness
averaging over 50 points a game that year, a record that many
doubt will ever be broken. But then, the next year something
unimaginable happened. Wilt returned to shooting free-throws
overhand and was, once again, a terrible free throw shooter.
So why in the world would one person make this kind of a
decision? Did he think that ultimately he would improve his
overhand shooting ability? Not at all.
In his autobiography he has a throwaway line where he says, “I
know I should have kept shooting underhanded, but I just felt like a
sissy.” He goes on to say how much he disliked feeling that way in
front of his team. His surrogate family. 
2
When the author and journalist Malcom Gladwell tells this story, he
concludes that even though Wilt knew the right thing to do, he
couldn’t do it because of the pressure that he felt from those closest
to him--whether that pressure was real or imagined.
It is this kind of pressure Jesus is warning us about when he speaks
of hating one’s own family. Any kind of pressure that causes us not
to do the right thing--no matter who that pressure comes from--
even from our families.
And I know what you are thinking--you’ve been thinking it since
you heard the scripture reading. “Hating one’s family is strong
language, especially on Labor Day weekend. Surely, Jesus doesn’t
actually mean that. I’m pretty sure one of the 10 commandments
says to honor mother and father.”
And yes, it sure does. It’s actually good for us to look at that so we
can better understand what Jesus is saying.
In the first century world, land and vocation are passed down from
father to son, father to son, and so on- meaning that whole families
would live together on the same piece of land for generations.
There are no hospitals or nursing homes so when mom, dad or
even grandma get too old or too sick to work, then the
commandment to honor one’s father and mother becomes
increasingly important. It is a commandment meant to protect the
most vulnerable members of the community and it seems to be
saying that even though this person can’t contribute in the same
way that they did for years, they are still to be treated with dignity
and respect--to be given a home among you.
So, pretend with me that you are a person living in this world with
your extended family with you on the land that’s been in your
family for a very long time. Land that your ancestors even called
the Promised Land. The land you believe God gave just to you. And 
3
now, this land is not only threatened, but occupied by a pagan
Roman army.
You, along with your fellow citizens and the rest of your family,
dream of an uprising. You dream of an anointed one, like David,
who will come and lead you in open revolt to overthrow Roman
rule.
Romans are the enemy; they are threatening your way of life. They
have their hands on the priesthood threatening your religious
liberty. You have no freedom of speech because most everyone
who openly speaks out against it, or attempts to raise a resistance
is silenced by the state in the name of peace. You are not free as you
believe you ought to be free.
This is the story that your grandma believes. This is the story that
your father believes. This is the story that you were raised to
believe. But then something happens that threatens to change you
forever.

One day you follow a crowd outside of town to see the man who
has the whole countryside in an uproar. His name is Jesus, and
sitting on the side of a hill, he begins speaking to the whole crowd
but it feels like he’s speaking directly to you: “Blessed are the poor
in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who
mourn, for they will be comforted.”
Not a person present makes a sound as Jesus continues, “You have
heard that it was said, ‘you shall love you neighbor and hate your
enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who
persecute you…”
It’s as if a lightning bolt has shot through your heart. ‘Love your
enemies’ is the last thing you wanted to hear, but you know in a
mysterious and unexplainable way that this is a word from God. 
4
These words rattle around in your head in the days and weeks to
come “Love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you--even
those who occupy us, you wonder? Could God be calling me to love
even the Romans?”
Imagine how hard it would be to love your enemy when you live in
the same home as grandma and grandma is deathly afraid that this
enemy is going to hurt her, that they threaten everything she
believes in. What kind of person could subject their grandma to
that? Surely, if you did, then your grandma would think that you
hated her.
Or imagine trying to sell all of your things and give to the poor, as
our scripture passage suggests, if your grandchildren live in the
same house as you and share those same things. It’s not at all
unlikely that your children would think of words as strong as ‘hate’
to describe your actions. If following Jesus comes at such a cost,
then who can pay it?
The way of Jesus is almost always more demanding than we realize,
and the danger of preaching a text like this is that most of us
preachers want to make it softer. We want to try to protect you and
our own selves from the text, but it is a radical text that was just as
provocative back then as it is today.
Now, when Jesus says “hate your father and mother,” I don’t think
Jesus is making a declaration about the way things should be as
much as he is making an observation. Following Jesus’ way of life is
demanding and costly, and not many are able to do it, especially
those tasked with caring for the needs of their family.
How can we love our enemy when our spouse may be in danger?
How can we sell all that we have and give it to the poor when we
have our children’s college funds to think about?
I’m sure many of you can think back on your lives or your own
conversion experience and remember times when you felt that 
5
special tugging on your heart. A time when you were filled with a
desire to give more of your money, more of your time, to go
somewhere and help those in need but something or someone held
you back.
Your parents guilted you into staying closer to home. Your spouse
talked you down off the ledge before you gave away the retirement
fund. You thought of your children before you traveled to that
dangerous place or quit your day job.
These are the tensions we live in and the difficult choices that we
must make.
There are also other times though, where we might be like Wilt
Chamberlain. We know the right thing to do, but won’t do it. We
know the enemy we ought to love or the help we need to give
others. Yet, we feel pressure-whether real or imagined-that keeps
us from doing what we know to be right.

This is the obstacle that I think Jesus observed in those genuinely
trying to follow him, who got caught in the crossfire of social and
even family pressures, and were unable to see it through to the
end. And we risk getting caught in that same crossfire.
Here is the most interesting thing about the Wilt Chamberlain
story: It would have actually been much better for his team if he
had continued to shoot his free-throws underhanded. Even if the
pressure he felt was real, and even if they would have laughed at
him and made fun of him. So be it. In the long run, what his team
really needed was for him to do it anyway.
Likewise, the most loving thing that we can do for our friends and
family is to love God and follow the way of Jesus. It may mean that
we do or say things that they don’t always agree with. We may see
some things differently, and that’s ok, because in the long run, it’s
what our team needs also.

Mark Yaconelli, a pastor and author tells a challenging story about
receiving a call from committed Christian woman. The woman was
clearly distressed after talking with her college-age son. She told of
how her son had decided to leave his studies to join a group of
Americans going to Iraq to be with Iraqi civilians during the
bombing and occupation. The group was going to work in a
children’s hospital and hoped that by being a visible presence as
American citizens they might be able to protect the lives of Iraqi
civilians, as well as increase awareness about the suffering of those
civilians back home.
The mother was upset and told her son he had made a commitment
to college and this was no time to engage in radical politics. The
pastor on the other end of the phone asked her how her son
responded. She sighed, and there was quiet over the phone for a
moment.
Then she answered with a sob in her voice, he said, “but mom, this
isn’t politics. This is about following Jesus. We’re going as a
Christian group. Didn’t you and the church teach me that Jesus was
always befriending people who were weak and suffering?”
The pastor waited in silence as she cried. Then finally the mother
said, “He’s right, you know. I know he’s right. But if I knew he was
going to do something like this I would have taken him out of the
church and put him in boy scouts instead.”
Jesus said to them, “Whoever comes to me and does not hate father
and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even
life itself, cannot be my disciple. Whoever does not carry the cross
and follow me cannot be my disciple.” ",Jakob Topper,"Dallas, TX",9/4/2016,
"I often hear the argument about the church’s relationship to culture—
whether we and other churches are getting too cozy with the values and
attitudes of worldly people and losing our biblical perspective. As this
view goes, the Bible offers us clear instructions about how to live and
think, and most of the time that will be more conservative than the
liberal culture we are surrounded by every day. Now, aside of the fact
that we are also a part of the wider culture—which makes it hard to
distinguish us against them—I simply say that when we do so, we seem
to focus on things we care about in other people’s behavior that the
Bible backs us up on and not so much on things inconvenient to us that
the Bible says we should care about anyway.
For instance, our text today nails most of us for the way we reflect the
values of the culture, and you don’t ever hear us say boo about this issue
because it would fall into the category of things that would loosen us up
rather than tighten us down. Jesus gives us new rules of social etiquette
that disturb our comfortable patterns: like whom we invite to weddings,
where we sit at banquet, and how we go about deciding our social
calendar.
Right off, we hear that Jesus goes to a Pharisee’s house for the Sabbath
meal. Shabbat shalom, Jesus. But then Luke slides in this little ditty: they
were watching him closely.
Pause here. I tell our pastoral residents that they had better get used to
being watched. It goes with being a paid Christian. Everyone’s an expert
on how you ought to live. And most of the time you will hear what they
think. And most of the time you will hear it from someone other than
them. It is what it is. Get used to it and figure out how to be your most
authentic self as a public person. The hardest thing about this is not
making the safest choice every time in order to avoid criticism. Criticism
goes with the job, because if we only needed managers of the status quo,
we could all memorize Miss Manners instead of Matthew, Mark, Luke
and John. But I digress, sort of … .
Back to Luke. He starts with a social occasion, and Jesus tells a parable 
2
that makes it a spiritual occasion. In other words, he’s interested in
showing us something about the difference between the way we
organize our lives by our own ego needs and how we would organize
them if we were submitting to the coming reign of God by the way we do
church now.
The parable has two parts—the first dealing with guests at a party, the
second dealing with a host. The first part is hard enough; the second
part is downright difficult. Let’s take the first part first.
Jesus notices how all the guests compete for the places of honor at the
dinner party. They want to be considered important by where they sit,
which is usually closest to the host or to the most esteemed member of
the community. This is natural. It’s culturally understandable. But it can
be harmful to our spiritual health.
What happens is that we start jockeying for honor as a way to boost our
egos and make ourselves feel important. And that means we are giving
human beings too much power over our souls. We are making our
proximity to people—our association with the “right kind of people”—
the measure of our worth. We’re always striving to be like the main
characters on the old TV show The Jeffersons. Remember the theme
song: We’re movin’ on up, to the east side. To a deluxe apartment in the
sky. Movin’ on up. To the east side. We’ve finally got a piece of the pie.
Whatever the situation, we all seek to move on up. We always compare
ourselves to people who have more. If we ever associate with those who
have less, it’s a sacrifice. We really want to be in the superior seat.
Jesus knows that if we continue this way of living, we will be completely
unprepared for the coming reign of God. For all who exalt themselves
WILL be humbled, and those who humble themselves WILL be exalted.
Notice, it’s WILL be, not MAY be. If we think we’re going to get a pass,
Jesus makes it clear that we won’t pass.
But if he had left it there, we might be tempted to feign humility and still
harbor hopes that the host would call us up to the front table. We might
make humility a strategy for exaltation. Wouldn’t it be just like us to
game the system? Jesus goes on to say that we shouldn’t even play the 
3
payback game. He says that when we give a party, we shouldn’t invite
those who can repay us in this life. If we really want an eternal reward,
we should invite those who can’t repay us: the poor, the crippled, the
lame, and the blind.
I don’t know about you, but I can’t remember the last time I took this
part of the Bible literally. It seems so natural that we would want to eat
with our family and friends and rich neighbors. These are our people.
What is Jesus getting at here?
I was in San Antonio a few days this week. My granddaughter Finley just
started first grade. Kim and I and Finley’s sisters went to have lunch
with her on Thursday. She was excited to tell us about her new friends:
Poppy, Paloma and Hannah. They had decided to form a girls’ club—
invitation only, don’t you know?! Well, the plan went haywire the very
next day. At recess, the girls got their club together to play, and some
other kids wanted to play with them, too. One of the girls in the club told
them to shoo. They weren’t in the club. They told the others that they
should find their own friends to play with. Suddenly, Finley had a Jesus
moment. She didn’t like that at all. What she thought at first was a good
idea—to be able to have an exclusive club of friends—turned out to
offend the values she had learned at home and church. So Finley quit the
club and joined the excluded girls on the playground.
This example gets to the heart of what Jesus wants us to see. There are
lots of ways to move toward others that get us into the ZIP code of Jesus’
priorities.
One of these ways is to address the inequalities between schools in our
own districts. These inequalities are partly a reflection of inequalities
generally, but also partly because of decisions we have made to make
our schools a close reflection of our neighborhoods. Wilshire member
Paula Woodbury has shown us a way to rebalance a bit. She was at a
meeting of Lake Highlands PTA presidents and sat next to a
kindergarten teacher at Thurgood Marshall Elementary. That teacher
described her calling to work in a high-needs school and what that
entailed.
Here are Paula’s words from Facebook: I had trouble going to sleep. I
woke up early. Her story just didn't sit right with me. These stories never 
4
do. This is our community. These are our kids. There shouldn't be such
disparity. I can’t do everything. But I can certainly try and do something.
She then invited other friends to join her in a school-supplies drive that
netted hundreds of glue sticks and construction paper and scissors and
the like. It isn’t everything, but it’s something. And every something like
that draws us closer to one another and to the reign of God, where there
is only one neighborhood and only one ZIP code.
But too often this is where we end—when it’s where we should begin. If
we want to get into the one neighborhood itself, we have to go ahead
and move there—literally or figuratively. We have to get into real
relationships with the poor, the crippled, the lame and the blind—with
those who are marginalized, excluded or left behind. What Jesus seems
to be saying to us is that we have to move from doing for others to being
with others. We have to move from charity to solidarity, from kindness
to friendship.
An Oak Cliff parent wrote an op-ed piece for The Dallas Morning News
this week, talking about his family’s decision to send their children to
their neighborhood DISD school. In the past, most middle-class families
in the Bishop Arts District just requested a transfer to Rosemont
Elementary School, which is the least economically diverse school in the
area. But with the revitalization of the area, Rosemont is overcrowded,
and now middle-class parents are sending their kids to private schools.
Here’s what Rob Shearer said: I came across research that concluded the
one thing schools can do that has made a consistent difference in
improving performance, that actually cut the achievement gap in half,
was integration. Specifically, income integration. And yet it is rarely
discussed or attempted. … I realized that the best thing I could do to
support the elementary school in my neighborhood is to enroll my kids
there. Not everyone thinks this is a good idea. If you think I’m
experimenting with my children's future, you and my mother have that in
common. But the research I’ve read in the past year indicates that my
children will have success in life regardless of the schools they attend. Both
my wife and I are college educated and we are comparatively upwardly
mobile. And regrettably, those two factors are the biggest indicators of 
5
educational achievement in America today.1
I’m not saying every parent has to make that same choice, but I am
saying that as Christians we have to be more intentional more often
about putting ourselves in relationship with people who are below us
on the social and economic spectrum. Actually, that’s not what I’m
saying; it’s what Jesus is saying.
And this ends up being good for us, too. Instead of insisting on the right
to divide (which seems to be the mantra of too many Christians today),
we should be practicing the right to unite. Against such there is no law!
When we go on mission trips, when we support gospel efforts around
the world, we almost always do so in the poorest and neediest places.
And we do that because we have a sense that our humbling ourselves
and our exalting those who are lowly are not just a key to their
salvation; it is also a key to ours.
That can start right here at home. Invite someone to church who doesn’t
fit our demographic. Invite this person to your Sunday school class and
then to lunch. What would happen to them and to you if you did? What
would happen to our church? I don’t know if we would grow
numerically, but I know we would grow spiritually.
We saw a beautiful example of this commitment to leave no one behind
at the Olympic Games in Rio. In one heat of the women’s 5,000-meter
race, New Zealand’s Nikki Hamblin fell and tripped U.S. runner Abbey
D’Agostino, who also went down. While Hamblin was wondering what
happened, D’Agostino got to her feet, and instead of running on, she
stopped to help Hamblin. [S]uddenly [I felt] this hand on my shoulder, like
‘get up, get up, we have to finish this’ and I was like, ‘yep, you’re right.’ This
is the Olympic Games—we have to finish this.
I’ve never met this girl before, and isn’t that just so amazing, such an
amazing woman. Regardless of the race and the result on the board, that’s
a moment that you’re never ever going to forget for the rest of your life, that girl shaking my shoulder, like ‘Come on, get up.’
It turns out that D’Agostino was injured in the fall and could only hobble
to the finish line. But here’s the kicker: for their sportsmanship, the
women were subsequently both given places in the 5,000 m final.
D’Agostino couldn’t run, and neither would medal; but both of them won.2
So maybe that’s a parable in itself with a Jesus ending: You will be
blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the
resurrection of the righteous. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",8/28/2016,
"If only Jesus would have stuck to teaching. Everybody loves a good
teacher. It’s when that teaching goes to healing that it disrupts the
fellowship and things get tense.
Like the story Luke tells of Jesus teaching in some synagogue, when
some bent-over woman catches his eye, and then some man who
was the leader of the synagogue starts fuming because Jesus should
have known better than to do things the way he did when there would
have been a better time or place to have done it—if it really needed
doing at all.
Oh, my, do we understand why Luke doesn’t name these people? He
names people in other stories. He names all the key players in the
birth narrative—we have Mary and Joseph, Elizabeth and Zechariah,
the Angel Gabriel, and so on. The two sisters from Bethany—namely,
Mary and Martha. The tax collector who was the wee little man,
Zacchaeus. But here we have a powerful story of all unnamed
people. I wonder why. I wonder whether Luke just wants us to crawl
into this story and find ourselves in it, name ourselves—our church
even. Just wondering.
He also doesn’t tell us why this woman in the synagogue that day
was so bent over. He says she couldn’t stand up straight for 18 years.
She was so bowed from the waist that she looked like a walking
jackknife.
After our children’s moment this morning, I got to thinking it might
have been a condition of backpackitis. I live across the street from an
elementary school. I see kids getting out of their parents’ cars every
school day, and they hoist their heavy backpacks filled with books
and other burdens. I sometimes worry that they’ll fall over backwards,
except for the forward lean they use to balance their march to school.
After 18 years of bent-over walking like that, maybe they won’t ever
be able to straighten up again. What do you think? Be careful, kids.
To everyone else’s eye, this woman suffered from a physical ailment.
She was so bent over that she probably leaned on a cane and would 
2
have gotten used to talking to your knees. Today we might call it
ankylosing spondylitis—a condition that causes people to be locked
in a bent-over position. I’ve seen people who suffered from this in
their later years. I always think, why can’t some doctor do something
about that?
Then it occurs to me: I’m a doctor. When my kids were little and their
friends found out that their daddy was a doctor, they were often quick
to clarify: yes, he’s a doctor, but not the kind that can do you any
good. But that’s usually because we think of illness mostly in physical
terms. Luke was himself a physician, and he tells us that this woman
had been crippled by a spirit for 18 years.
Now that may conjure up some scary movie about demonic
possession that makes you spill your popcorn in your lap just thinking
about it. But even now, when we talk about people who suffer
emotional or psychological trouble, we say things like, she struggles
with personal demons. And those demons can become squatters in
your life that make themselves at home without your permission.
They become hard to live with. They reside in your head or heart, and
you can feel powerless over them: helpless, hopeless.
But here is the Great Physician, Jesus himself, untrained in the
medical sciences but with a keen eye for what ails people from the
inside out. Something spiritual is crippling her more than something
physical. Even that has a medical name now: conversion disorder. In
other words, sometimes something we have done, or something that
was done to us, or something that just is us and we have a hard time
accepting it, becomes so paralyzing that it affects us physically.
I know a woman who has a hard time looking any man in the eyes
because of what one man did to her against her will—let’s just say—
18 years ago. I wonder about that woman in Luke’s story. What
happened to her?
Truth to tell, lots of us in this room today know how this woman might
have felt. Let’s do an experiment, shall we? Are you up for this? All
right, now—let’s see whether we can imagine how this woman felt
when she went into—let’s just say—church that day. Stand up if you
are able. Good. Now bend over at the waist. Go ahead. Now hold that
position. How does it feel? Vulnerable? Humiliating? Painful? 
3
Now, let’s say that a spirit has you in that position. Mostly I’m thinking
of a spirit inside you that makes you feel like you are bent over all the
time. What is it? Are you bent over inside because of some memory
that brings you shame and you don’t know how to look people in the
eye because you feel dirty or unworthy? Have you done something
you can’t forgive yourself for? Is anger just tearing you up on the
inside? Are you depressed for reasons you don’t understand? Have
you just wanted to be some definition of normal all your life and you
don’t know how to deal with your difference? What is your bentness
about?
All right now, before you sit down, I want you to imagine that Jesus is
here right now. He is. He sees you as you are from the inside. He
sees the spirit of infirmity that keeps you crippled. Now listen:
Woman, man, you are free from your ailment. Boom. Mic drop. Did
you hear that? You are free. Now feel his hands on your back,
straightening you up. Straighten up right now.
There. Beautiful. How do you feel? Listen, this is no parlor trick. And,
no, we’re not going to pass the plate again. This is the good news.
God does not want you to be knotted up with guilt, bent over in
shame, torn up with worry or fear about who you are in the eyes of
heaven. Jesus is the liberator of all things that bind us and keep us
from knowing that we are children of promise.
That’s why when Jesus had to deal with the synagogue leader about
this. He reminded the man that this woman was a daughter of
Abraham. That means she is a child of promise. And so are you.
Don’t let anyone tell you any different. When Jesus finishes telling
you the truth about yourself, you are free. Now don’t start bending
back over again to any evil spirits. Stand up in the sanctuary. Throw
your heads back in gratitude. And praise God from this point on.
Of course there’s more to this story. Action and reaction. It’s
Newton’s third law of motion: For every action, there is an equal and
opposite reaction. We didn’t need a genius physicist to tell us, if we
were just paying attention to life. Here we see it again. Jesus sees
someone in need of healing on the Sabbath day. He has compassion
on the person, and he heals her. Immediately the guardians of all
things religiously proper throw a fit. In this case it’s the leader of the 
4
synagogue. He knows the Law of Moses, and the law of the Medes
and Persians, and I wouldn’t be surprised if he hadn’t memorized
Robert’s Rules of Order, too, don’t you know?!
He is right in everything he says. And he is wrong in the most
important way. He never takes time to take in what it might mean to
this woman to feel like a full and dignified daughter of Abraham again.
He doesn’t run right up to her and sing harmony in her hallelujah
chorus. He won’t let himself cry tears of joy for one who is able to
hold her head high now among the people of God. He goes straight
into fixing blame and finding fault— not, mind you, with what was
done, but instead it was all about how and when and why. Sigh.
What Luke wants us to see, I think, is that while the woman needed
straightening up, the man needed straightening out. The woman
needed less humiliation; the man needed more humility.
Let’s look at the man’s argument. Work is forbidden on the Sabbath
day, according to the law. Healing is work. Therefore Jesus is guilty
of working on the Sabbath. He is sinning, in other words. And, maybe
what’s worse, he is messing with the orderly rules of the community
that the leader is sworn to watch over.
But before we get to what Jesus says, please note that the man
doesn’t actually accuse Jesus himself; he blames the woman for
putting herself in the position to be healed on the Sabbath. Here we
go again—it’s as old as the Bible and older: always blame the
woman. Can we just stop that now, people? I mean, really, once and
for all.
Jesus reminds the man that the law may be strict but that
accommodations are made for reasons of mercy. For example,
feeding your animals on the Sabbath is work, but you get excused for
that. And aren’t people more precious than pets? Apparently not to all
of us. Jesus is telling the church where to focus.
People. The focus is people, people! We are to be a healing
community that seeks the full dignity of every child of God, every son
and daughter of Abraham in our midst. Compassion is the hallmark of
a spiritual community that invokes the name of the All Merciful God of
Jesus Christ. We can be so right sometimes that we’re wrong. We’ve 
5
got to straighten out our hearts so that people can straighten up and
claim their places of honor.
The 1958 book The Ugly American tells the story of an American
engineer, Homer Atkins—a man with an ugly face—who was sent to
the fictional Southeast Asian country of Sarkhan to build dams and
roads for the military. Atkins refused to build the dams and roads until
the military first solved some of the everyday problems of the people.
At the suggestion of his wife, Emma, he designed a bicycle treadmill
pump to get water up to the hillside paddies on which the people
depended for food. For centuries this water had been laboriously
carried by pails.
Emma was also curious about the fact that every woman over sixty
had a bent back. Then she noticed that after the monsoon season,
the sweeping of debris from the streets was done by older people
who used brooms with short handles. Since wood for longer handles
cost too much and was in short supply, Emma found a long-stalked
reed and planted shoots from this reed by her door. She tended these
reeds carefully. One day, when neighbors were in her house, she cut
a tall reed, bound coconut fronds to it and began to sweep with her
back straight. When the people questioned her concerning the reed,
she told them where they could find them growing.
Four years later, when Emma and Homer were back in Pittsburgh,
they received a letter of thanks from an elder of the village. The letter
read: In the village of Chang Dong today, the backs of our old people
are straight and firm. No longer are their bodies painful and bent. You
will be pleased to know that on the outskirts of the village we have
constructed a small shrine in your memory . . . at the foot are these
words: 'In memory of the woman who unbent the backs of our
people.’1
Would that they could say about Wilshire someday that because of
our acts of compassion, the backs and the souls of many people
have been unbent. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",8/21/2016,
"“I swear to fulfill to the best of my ability and judgment this covenant and
share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.
I will apply, for the benefit of the sick, all measures which are required. …I
will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that
warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh the surgeon's knife or
the chemist's drug. …I will not be ashamed to say ""I know not,"" nor will I
fail to call on my colleagues when the skills of another are needed. … I will
prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure. … May
I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I
long to experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.”
Doctors all over the world stand together believing in this oath, trusting that
this will be true in their practice. The Hippocratic Oath was written between
the 5th and 3rd century B.C. by Hippocrates. This “Father of Western
Medicine” was known for having precise techniques and a hospitable
presence. He believed that this oath was not just for those practicing
medicine, though it is directly related to practitioners, but an oath for
humanity to be well-kept, honest, calm and understanding. In his original
oath, Hippocrates made this promise not just to humanity but also to his
Greek gods.
For many in this room, we too have taken an oath. It may not directly be the
Hippocratic Oath, but similar.
Do you remember?
Whether you did the long walk down the aisles or recited it at confirmation
class. You pledged your heart, your mind and soul to loving God and
humanity. Promising to believe in one God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
Confessing Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior through his redeeming.
Pledging to turn from sin and follow Christ, to live within the fellowship of
the church and serve Jesus Christ in the world!
Whether you were sprinkled or dunked down under the waters in the
baptistery, you found yourself confessing to the dying of self: buried with
Jesus by baptism into death, not so that you can continue in sin but in order 
2
to abound and share the newness of life.
Through your words and your actions to God and humanity, you took an
oath!
Yet, in our passage for today Jesus tells us, “It seems that we have forgotten
this oath.” It seems that once we were like Hippocrates, holding on and
believing the promises and commitments we once made, yet now we have
become hypocrites.
We claim to believe, but fail to act.
What was a small gathering of lessons for the disciples turned into a
gathering of thousands. People were climbing and trampling over each other
in order to hear what Jesus had to say. While they were words for the
disciples, they were words that neither created a secret nor were closed off to
just the twelve. What Jesus had to say could be meant for all so they might
know what it means to be a disciple.
Maybe the thousands in the crowd thought this was going to be another of
Jesus’ uplifting messages or maybe they would get a glimpse of a
performance, or a saving.
Yet they failed to realize that Jesus was walking to his death in Jerusalem.
After giving parable after parable, smiling in their faces and patiently
answering questions when they didn't understand, Jesus finally goes off.
“I came to bring fire! If you thought peace was the goal, you haven’t been
listening because division is to come!” Now, one could say Jesus’ words in
this passage are descriptive rather than prescriptive. It is not his purpose to
set children against parents, but this very well may happen when the work of
Christ is stirred up.
Divisions occur because of our decisions. Decisions that we ultimately make
in response to Christ or even for ourselves.
But Jesus isn’t done yet. He says, “You can interpret the weather but you
can’t interpret the present time.” I imagine someone leaning to his or her
neighbor saying, “We live in the Middle East; it’s hot. It is always hot!
That's not hard to know.” 
3
All of a sudden Jesus yells out, “You hypocrites!” And they began to look
around in the crowd to see if tax collectors, politicians, Sadducees, Pharisees
and some televangelists were around because Jesus had only used that word
when referring to those people. And I wonder how long it took the crowd to
realize those other people weren’t there, but Jesus was talking about them.
Jesus is not reprimanding the crowd for their inability to understand the
world through the lens of Christ. But reprimanding them for their
unwillingness to do so.
They were unwilling to acknowledge the character of Christ within the
world, the presence of salvation, the action of God which demands a
decision from God’s people, whether it creates divisiveness or not. They
were unwilling to hear the voices of those marginalized. They were
unwilling to hear injustices because they are not directly related to them and
at times even unwilling to hear the hearts of those in their own congregation
and community. Unwilling but not unable.
Does it sound familiar? It makes me wonder how often do we fail to realize
that we are included in the hypocrite group Jesus is talking to. We love to be
the ones looking around in the crowd searching for the real hypocrites and
not see ourselves as the guilty party.
Like the crowd, we find ourselves coming to church and may be a little
surprised by the passage that is before us. When I first read the passage it
made me want do the fourth sermon in the series Life in the Commonwealth
of Christ, an encore after George’s series. Then I remembered I have too
many student loans and that would be a worse sermon to preach!
Jesus’ message sounds harsh, aggressive and rather uncomfortable to hear.
But here’s the question: Is that Jesus’ fault or ours? Maybe Jesus is right, we
have failed to interpret the present time. We have failed to live in the ways
we have promised.
See, we live in a time where schools and libraries have banned books such as
Catcher in the Rye and To Kill a Mockingbird because they are harmful to
youth, but our laws also allow someone to own a semi-automatic weapon.
Generalizing and marginalizing become honorable acts. 
4
Living in a time where many agree to justice as long as it’s my kind of
justice and allows me to keep my comfort. Because it appears justice served
as food to those who can’t afford it, clean water for those who need it to
survive, education for those to partake in this country’s system, or equality
for every citizen seems too costly.
A time where children are told no matter your race, gender, how rich or poor
you are, you can be or do anything you want. Then watch as the world
denies, belittle, and tells many of them to succumb to another. Words that
were once laced with hope become words of betrayal.
If this present time were represented as weather, I would say we are in the
midst of storm. It’s partly cloudy but the sun is still peeking out from behind
the clouds.
How do we interpret a time, such as this?
Theorists and philosophers have made it clear: time and space correlate with
one another. We can measure time only by space and space only in time.
Therefore, in order for one to interpret their time, they must realize and
understand their space. Space is more than land, but within space is
everything that once created “beside-each-otherness.”
Influences of race, class, gender, education, politics, and location greatly
negate or validate how we interpret our time. These aspects regulate how we
perceive our world and even how we act within the world. Whether
consciously or unconsciously we all have our own perspective. Due to that,
there are things we do not see and choose to ignore.
However, I must remind you, none of those aspects make up your identity.
They may be features, but they do not create who you are and how you are
to be. For our identity is placed with the living God--God coming through
Christ reconciling the world unto God’s self. A God that places the Holy
Spirit in each believer to stir up, lead, and move within this world. And
God’s space is limitless and made up of all.
We do not interpret the world through any worldly features or aspects, but
through the lens of this God. When you joined this church, you married into
a family that believes in being a bold witness to the way of Christ in our
time. 
5
Joining together builds a community of faith shaped by the Spirit of Jesus
Christ.
It is who Wilshire is and who we continue to strive to be. Wilshire is a place
where God’s grace abounds and where our love is shared among all. It is in
our DNA to make space for grace. To make space for all, even a young
minister like myself, to stand in this pulpit.
We are a fellowship of believers who seek God’s love, Jesus’ grace and the
community of the Holy Spirit. We devote ourselves to love God with all our
hearts, souls, minds and strength. We commit to loving our neighbors as
ourselves. This is our language. Our vision. Our mission. We strive to
realize the kingdom of God on earth, seeking justice, loving mercy and
walking humbly with God.
Wilshire—children of God—we must live into that. Therefore, we cannot
observe our time just from our small spaces that make us feel warm and
fuzzy. For when we live into our mission, when we understand and act in the
ways of Christ, the tension it holds and the crosses we must bear, we accept
that God’s worldview is not just for our comfortable small spaces, but a
mission to stand beside and love all, no matter what and no matter where.
We must not only believe it but act within it.
The movie Clear and Present Danger is a 1994 American spy thriller. Jack
Ryan, played by Harrison Ford, is appointed Acting Deputy Director of the
CIA. While in this position he discovers his colleagues are conducting a
secret war against drug lords in Colombia with the approval of the President
of the United States. In one of the scenes, Ryan goes to see a colleague,
Admiral Greer, played by James Earl Jones.
Ryan tells of his fear and the hardship of digging deeper into this work. If he
continues, his colleagues, the president, and those within his small space
would not be happy. Admiral Greer, who is on his deathbed, looks into
Ryan’s eyes and says, “You took an oath, if you recall, when you first came
to work here. And it wasn't an oath to the National Security Advisor of the
United States, I mean to his boss... and I don't mean the President. You gave
your word to his boss and you gave your word to the people of the United
States. Your word is who you are.” 
6
As Christians, we stood before God and entered into a covenant, we stood
with each other and took an oath. Confessing to believe in the truth and to
act upon the truth, no matter the consequences.
Because not only do we live by the Word, but the living word is who we are.
It is up to us, those who have witnessed the grace of God, to also carry the
burden of pursuing the will of God. Together, we must read the signs of the
times, not just the weather, but civil rights of people, politics, and social
injustices and must respond appropriately.
If the kingdom of God is to come on earth as it is in heaven, we as the
church must understand the events of the earth and pursue how best to
respond with a message of heaven.
We gave our word to the boss. Do you remember?
Amen. ",Timothy Peoples,"Dallas, TX",8/14/2016,
"A greedy man was more in love with his money than his wife. He
made her promise that when he died, she would bury his money with
him. The man died and the widow was at the graveside, dressed in
black, sitting next to her best friend as the casket began to be
lowered into the earth. Suddenly she said, “Stop!” She pulled out an
old shoebox and asked for it to be put into the casket with her
husband.
Her friend was aghast. Surely you aren’t crazy enough to bury that
stingy man’s money with him. The widow replied, I am a good
Christian and I cannot lie. I promised him I would do it, so I did. I
gathered it all up, deposited it into my bank account and wrote him a
check.
We all know the old saying, You can’t take it with you. But most of us
live like we can because we aren’t intentional about what happens to
our wealth after we’re gone, or even before that.
I believe in and practice financial planning, and I think you should,
too. Kim and I have wills, and although our kids get the majority of
what will be left, the church is also included as a beneficiary because
you are our family of faith, and as with our family of blood, we want to
be a blessing to generations to come. We each have some life
insurance, and we have long-term care insurance in the event that we
live long enough to move into one of those places where some of you
already live and that provide increasing levels of care that we might
not otherwise be able to afford. We have retirement accounts we’ve
been paying into, along with the church (and thank you for that, by
the way) for many years. We are hoping to have planned well enough
to someday live modestly well without relying on our children.
Wealth management is a booming business in the financial sector.
Private wealth management took off in the early 1980s as a way to
help high-net- worth individuals make good decisions about their
accumulated possessions. Investment strategies, estate planning, tax 
2
avoidance: these are just a few of the many things that private wealth
managers do for the wealthy. And now wealth management has
trickled down to the masses. The lessons learned from the rich can
be applied to average people because in some ways F. Scott
Fitzgerald was wrong in saying, The rich are different from us.
Managing wealth is a wise and responsible Christian practice. But
according to Jesus, it may also be dangerous to our souls. Take care!
Jesus says. Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life
does not consist in the abundance of possessions. He wasn’t just
talking to rich people; he was talking to you and me.
We have reached the last of three sermons on Life in the
Commonwealth of Christ. We have looked at defeating debt,
practicing generosity, and today managing wealth. There’s a
progression here, and I hope you have heard all these sermons or
will revisit them all as a matter of spiritual discipline. All three together
address something that we know in our hearts is crucial to who we
are and how we live. All three ask us to put our trust in God to provide
everything we need when we need it so that we can experience the
abundant life that Christ promises us.
What I want you to think about is this: Jesus is your primary wealth
manager. He is the one we need to listen to first and last, for time and
eternity both. Our text today gives us a picture of what is at stake.
A certain man was concerned about his future. He wanted his brother
to share his inheritance with him. Now in that culture, they operated
according to the law of primogeniture. That is, the bulk of a father’s
estate passed entirely to the eldest son. This didn’t sit well with the
younger brother, who wanted his older brother to do the right thing
and share the father’s inheritance with him. We don’t know whether it
was a common practice that the older brother would share his
inheritance with his younger brother. It seems fair, even if the custom
didn’t require it.
But Jesus tells the man he’s not prepared to spend his messianic
authority settling financial disputes. Rather, he points to a deeper
spiritual concern: whether the man is allowing his possessions to
possess him. 
3
This is a problem we all have to guard against. Do we manage our
wealth, or does our wealth manage us? Money can own us instead of
us owning it. We start figuring that we are what we have. And that
ends up taking our eyes off the real prize.
This is why Jesus tells us to make purses for ourselves that don’t
wear out, treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not corrupt
and where thieves can’t break in and steal. No matter how secure
your earthly investments are, there is always risk. The only safe
investment is heavenly.
Jesus tells a parable about a farmer who had a magnificent harvest.
He saw windfall as a way to secure his own future. And that future
was qualitatively different from what he had known to that point in life.
He came into a great deal of money, and his first instinct was to think
of how to use it to make his life easier. I know what I’ll do: I’ll tear
down my barns and build bigger ones in order to protect my assets.
From now on, I can live off what I have accumulated. I don’t have to
work or worry anymore. I don’t have to depend upon the earth or the
rains next year or any year. I don’t have to concern myself with
neighbors who don’t have enough to eat. I can just sit back and enjoy
life. Eat, drink and be merry.
But look at what this experience did to the man. It changed him.
Money always changes us—for good or ill, don’t you know?!
That quotation from Scott Fitzgerald I cited earlier: it came from a
short story he wrote in 1925 called The Rich Boy. Here’s a fuller
version of it. Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different
from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does
something to them, makes them soft where we are hard, and cynical
where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is
very difficult to understand. They think, deep in their hearts, that they
are better than we are because we had to discover the
compensations and refuges of life for ourselves. Even when they
enter deep into our world or sink below us, they still think that they
are better than we are. They are different.
Some years later, Ernest Hemingway responded to that in a short 
4
story of his own. Here’s what he said: The rich were dull and they
drank too much, or they played too much backgammon. They were
dull and they were repetitious. He remembered poor Scott Fitzgerald
and his romantic awe of them and how he had started a story once
that began, ‘The very rich are different from you and me.’ And how
someone had said to Scott, Yes, they have more money. But that
was not humorous to Scott. He thought they were a special
glamorous race, and when he found they weren’t, it wrecked him as
much as any other thing that wrecked him.1
Jesus doesn’t want riches to wreck us. Wealth, honestly gained, is a
gift from God to be managed in a way that brings people together in a
great economy of common prosperity, not a way to make one person
look down upon another as if we have nothing in common.
Maybe the man who approached Jesus was right about his brother.
Maybe his brother was guilty of hoarding his wealth and not sharing
it. But we can’t work on other people; we can only work on ourselves.
The wealthy have to guard their hearts against greed, but those who
are not as wealthy have to do that very same thing.
You can be greedy with a lot of money or a little money. It’s not a
question of how much any of us has; it’s a question of how each of us
uses what we have.
Does the way you look at your possessions deepen your faith in
God’s faithfulness or create greater fear that you will not have enough
unless you act in your own interest? Does the way you manage your
wealth bring you into richer relationships with other people or become
a means of measuring your value over against others—whether they
have more than you or less?
The antidote to this is Jesus’ counsel: Sell your possessions and give
alms. Notice first that he talks of possessions, not just income. Most
of us give our tithes out of our income stream. But here Jesus
challenges us to use our accumulated wealth in giving. Almsgiving is Jesus’ directive. That is, giving to the neediest for their
own sake, not to bring glory and honor to you. If you give to others—
especially to the needy, you give them an opportunity to share in
God’s abundance through you.
Now, I don’t know why God set the world up this way? I suppose God
could have created a world in which everyone always received
exactly what everyone else did. I suspect it has to do with God’s
desire for us to learn how to deal with our desires. It may just be
another way in which we are tested at the heart of our humanity—
whether we will reflect the image and likeness of God by being
generous with our neighbor, or whether we will break faith with God
and our neighbor by taking care of only ourselves.
The great Jewish sage, Maimonides, saw the truth about how
almsgiving affects the giver as well as the receiver. He created a
ladder of giving in which the lowest rung on the ladder is to give as an
obligation, grudgingly; and the highest rung on the ladder is to give in
such a way as to help the receiver become self-reliant and thereby
also learn to share in the grace of giving. In between are rungs on the
ladder that address the attitude of the giver and whether the giver is
even known to the receiver. The point is that as we mature in our
managing of our wealth, we are changed for the better, too.2
I saw a remarkable movie this week that is soon to come out in wider
release. Gleason is the story of Steve Gleason, a former NFL player
with the New Orleans Saints who contracted the dreaded disease
ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.
When Steve received his diagnosis, he knew that his life would be cut
short and that the decline before his death would be an awful reality:
being trapped inside a body that wouldn’t respond to his brain.
Steve and his wife, Michel, were trying to conceive a child when he
received his diagnosis. They decided to go ahead, and their son,
Rivers, was born in October 2011. Right away, before Rivers was
even born, Steve began a video journal for his son. He wanted him to
know that he was loved, and he wanted him to know his dad while his dad could still communicate with him. He believed that the most
important thing he could do with his remaining life was to pass on to
his boy the wealth of wisdom he had accumulated.
That video journal became a movie, and if you go see it, my only
suggestion is that you take a hanky—or better yet, two.
Managing our wealth—whether accumulated wisdom or
possessions—is a spiritual act of love if it is directed toward holy
purposes. It’s certainly true that you can’t take it with you, but what
you leave behind will forever define your legacy. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",8/7/2016,
"What If Everybody Did That? That’s the title of a children’s book by Ellen
Javernick. It’s the story of a young boy who has to learn the consequences of his
irresponsible behavior. The boy feeds popcorn to the bears in the zoo, he throws
an empty soda can out the car window, he licks frosting from a wedding cake,
and he interrupts the librarian during story time. Each time, a scolding adult asks
him, What if everybody did that? Of course we adults know the answer from
experience: we’d have lots of sick animals, littered highways, ruined cakes, and
library chaos. The boy learns that his actions have consequences for the world
we live in together. He learns what we all have to learn but don’t always learn,
because while we all grow old we don’t all grow up: It’s not about “me.”
We’re in week two of three weeks of looking at Life in the Commonwealth of
Christ. Last week we focused on defeating debt, and next week we will consider
managing wealth. Today we need to address the spiritual discipline of generosity.
When we talk about generosity, we should first consider the larger context of our
lives together, in which all our actions matter beyond ourselves.
Some states in our Union call themselves a commonwealth. The terms are
interchangeable, but the language of commonwealth is more suggestive than
state. A state may describe little more than boundaries on a map. Yes, each
state has its own history and cultural identifiers, but a commonwealth speaks
more about people’s lives together. It suggests the ways we organize ourselves
for a healthy and prosperous life for all citizens.
And that goes to the point of economy. The word economy literally refers to the
rules or laws of a household. A commonwealth is a household of sorts—a large
civic family. Just as in a household, everyone has to pitch in to make the family
work, so a commonwealth also needs the gifts of each to contribute to the
wellbeing of all.
We pay taxes in order to create safe and healthy public spaces where we can life
together well. Likewise, we pay tithes and offerings in the commonwealth of
Christ in order for our spiritual community to be safe and healthy as we grow in
grace and impact our world.
The church is the commonwealth of Christ. We share life together. Each of us
has gifts to be used for the sake of all. Some of these gifts are financial. A
healthy church requires the strong financial participation of all of its members if it
is to thrive in its mission. 
2
It might help for you to ask yourself at this point: What if everybody did that? That
is, what is your level of financial generosity, and what if everybody did what you
are doing? What kind of church would we have?
Now, if you are laden down with personal consumer debt, it is difficult to be
generous. Last week we talked about making that Job 1. Defeat debt so that you
can share in the blessing of giving.
Someone asked me after the sermon last week if I thought that getting out of
debt should come first, followed by beginning to give after that victory is won. I
know that some experts recommend this approach, and I won’t quibble about this
strategy being given the priority of becoming free of consumer debt in the interest
of becoming a more-generous person. But my own counsel is that you work on
both things at once: begin to give something as a way of slowly developing your
generosity quotient, while you make a bigger contribution to eradicating debt.
It’s like the process of getting physically fit: you don’t just cut down on calories in
order to lose weight, and then when you hit your target goal begin to add
exercise into your routine. You cut calories and begin to walk right away so that
you can boost your metabolism, too.
Today let’s look at the biblical imperative of giving. We begin in Malachi 3. God is
speaking through the prophet to call Israel on the carpet about their lack of
generosity, which is starving the community of God’s designed resources for
wellbeing. It’s a sin against God and the community that people are not paying
their tithes. Will anyone rob God? Malachi asks. And the people respond, How
are we robbing God? In your tithes and offerings, Malachi says.
When Israel was suffering economic distress, the diagnosis was that they
themselves were responsible. God has set up the world in such a way that God’s
power to bless is unleashed by our faithfulness. We experience the curse of
communal poverty by our failure to be generous. If we want God to bless us, we
have to participate in giving in the way God has prescribed. Otherwise we are
robbing God of the satisfaction of God’s design work for the world.
Now the tithe is simply this: giving one tenth of our income to the Lord through
the community of faith. That money is entrusted to “the storehouse”—that’s the
church in our case—in order to care for the commonwealth and to bless the
world. Withholding our gifts harms our relationships and impairs our global
mission.
Richard Stearns is the president of World Vision, a Christian relief organization
we partner with. He says it would take $65 billion a year to eliminate world
poverty in one generation. Think of that. And get this: if American Christians were
all to tithe, we would have $435 billion left over after eliminating worldwide
poverty! That is, after providing clean water for everyone in the world. After 
3
ending severe hunger. After defeating malaria. After providing a basic education
for all children in the world. After creating 250 million new jobs. The churches in
America would have 435 billion dollars left over each and every year to tackle
their own problems.1
That is God’s ingenious plan for the planet. But apparently we have a better idea.
It’s just that our idea isn’t working. So maybe we should go back to God’s idea
and give it a try.
Now some of you might say, Well, isn’t that being a little legalistic, George, and
maybe a lot self-serving? I mean, don’t you always warn us about taking the
Bible too literally? But now that it suits you to be legalistic. … Well, yes, it’s true
that a tithe is a fixed percentage, an Old Testament standard. But if we look at
the New Testament, we aren’t given a lesser standard based on grace instead of
law; we’re given a higher standard. Everything belongs to God, and we belong to
each other. The New Testament emphasizes proportional giving just as much as
the Old Testament does.
A tithe is not a legalistic rule; it is a benchmark for generosity in the Christian life.
Benchmarks in the financial world are ways of measuring ourselves against
others. If you own a mutual fund, you might want to know how it’s doing against
other funds. Let me ask you, do you want to do at least as well in your
investment earnings as other funds are doing? Or do you just want to do your
own thing, even if it doesn’t measure up? The tithe is a benchmark for spiritual
generosity. It’s aspirational for some of us who aren’t yet giving that much, and it
is a baseline for giving for those of us who are doing more.
Take a spiritual inventory right now of your index of generosity. How are you
doing? If you are giving nothing, begin to give something. If you are giving only 2
to 3 percent like most American Christians, look at the tithe as your giving goal
because, really, do you want to be only an average American Christian? Start
increasing your giving right away in order to reach the biblical benchmark. And if
you have been giving a tithe for many years, good for you and thank you. But is
that the end of it? Do you want to settle for being average in God’s eyes? Move
on from tithing to offerings on top of that.
This habit of tithing is one of the greatest gifts my parents gave me. They were
generous givers all their married lives. Now that my dad is gone, my mother has
told her financial advisor that she wants to continue to give her tithe to her church
and offerings on top of that to missionaries around the world. Think about that.
On a lesser income, she is willing to live on less in order to keep up her giving.
She doesn’t want others to suffer loss just because she has less due to loss. When Paul is challenging the church at Corinth about their participation in giving
to the needs of the saints, he uses the example of the Macedonian church. This
church was much poorer than the Corinthian church. And yet they gave
themselves first to the Lord and then to the cause of relieving the poverty of
others.
Friends, by any measure we are a rich church. All you have to do is to look in the
parking lot to see that. (I say that because Kim got a new car yesterday, don’t
you know?!) Our cars tell us we have enough money to tithe and to give beyond
the tithe. But the offering plate says something else. If only the active resident
members in this church made the median income for Dallas of about $60,000 per
year, and if all of us tithed, we would give more than $6 million annually. Now
what do you think our church’s median income really is? And what would that
mean for our life together as God designed it? What would it mean for our
mission partners if we had several million more dollars per year to change the
face of our community and the life of people across the globe? Why, it would be
such a phenomenon that the media would be here for something other than the
Ebola crisis, race relations or sex.
I believe that the greatest moral and spiritual problem the church in America has
is a generosity problem. Not race. Not sex. Money. Jesus said that where our
treasure is, there our hearts will be also. In other words, we become more
generous not by waiting for our hearts to be moved, but by moving our treasure
first. And then we might start seeing other things differently because these things
won’t be about power and control; they will be about love and respect.
Kim and I were out to dinner the other night with a couple of deacons. When the
bill came, we decided to split it, but because we had ordered a little more than
the others, I said I would cover the tip for both of us. He said okay, but that this
amount depended on how much I tip. If it wasn’t enough, he would add to it. I
love that. That’s his spiritual nature. He is a generous person after years of
practice. His tithing has spilled over to his tipping instead of the other way
around, which is what most people do.
At the end of the book What If Everybody Did That? there’s a surprising twist.
The boy comes home and gives his mother a hug. The story points to the
positive effects of our generous and responsible individual decisions on everyone
else.2
Here’s my question to you today. What if we all learned the joy of generosity and
set the benchmark for other churches by our giving? What if everybody did that?
Just imagine",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",7/31/2016,
"Today is the Lord’s Day, but it also falls right between the two big
political conventions that are crowning their presidential nominees and
offering a vision for America, and to some extent the world. I shouldn’t
have to, but let me remind you that our citizenship and loyalty are first
and finally to the kingdom of heaven. Before and after being Americans,
we are members of the commonwealth of Christ. The way we live in the
world and the values we bring to the world must come from the way we
live together as the church.
We have two passages of Scripture today that keep us tethered to that
vision of life in the commonwealth of Christ—a phrase I am using to refer
to the church as we see it in the Book of Acts, which is inspired by the
mission of Jesus in Luke 4. For three Sundays we are going to look at
aspects of our economic life together as Christians: defeating debt,
practicing generosity and managing wealth.
When Bill Clinton ran against George Bush the Elder in 1992, his
campaign manager, James Carville, kept reminding him that voters
cared about only one thing. So he kept repeating to himself: It’s the
economy, stupid. And he won. Now, that may be good politics, but it’s not
good theology. Economics is one important aspect of life. Having enough
money to live on and having some hope of prosperity are key staples of
human flourishing that God cares about. But there are many other
things that matter, too: like love and friendship, music and art, health
and hobbies. But money matters, too, so we need to address it rather
than avoid it in the church.
Today we need to talk frankly about the threat of financial debt: how it
can depress the human spirit and prevent people from experiencing the
freedom and joy of their God-given humanity.
The average American household’s credit-card debt has increased by 52
percent in the last decade. The average household has $5,700 of
consumer debt, and if that household carries a balance on the credit 
2
card from month to month, the average jumps to $16,000.1 That means
that they are so far behind that they can’t get ahead. The pressure and
stress of that are constant, embarrassing and debilitating.
I may be talking to some of you. And if I am, I want to tell you that
because you are part of this church, because you are living in the
commonwealth of Christ, we are here for you and with you. You are not
alone. We want you to be free from debt and free to put your resources
to use for the wellbeing of others—to move from being a debtor to a
giver. But the first step is to defeat whatever debt has you in bondage.
The whole biblical narrative of God’s salvation story begins in Egypt,
where the children of Israel are in debt slavery to the Pharaoh. Before
we can even begin to see that debt slavery has become for us Christians
a metaphor for sin, we have to see it as a problem in itself that God cares
about. When we talk about redemption from sin, that language is rooted
in the realm of debt slavery. Someone is owned by someone else. There
is a debt that enslaves that person to a master, and it must be paid or
forgiven if the person is able to go free.
When Jesus says in the Nazareth synagogue at the start of his public
ministry that the Spirit of the Lord is upon him, and that his mission as
messiah is to proclaim release to the captives, to let the oppressed go
free, and to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor, that vision comes right
out of God’s deliverance of Israel from slavery in Egypt and the practices
of the beloved community of Israel that from then on would not allow
any to ever be enslaved again. In fact, that last phrase, the year of the
Lord’s favor, is a reference to the year of Jubilee, in which every 50
years, all debts in Israel were cancelled. Get this: God would not let
families suffer generational poverty because of the bad decisions of one
generation or the exploitive practices of lenders.
So we should begin at home and talk about the spirituality of debt in the
Christian life. Owe no one anything except the debt of love, Paul says in
Romans. And that’s a beautiful place to start. We should begin with the
foundation of Christian love, which says that all debt has to do with
some kind of relationship. What should characterize our relationships:
freedom or servitude? Should our relationships in the church be respect among equals, where everyone may be counted on to contribute
something to others, or are they perpetually unequal because some are
always in the position of need?
Our duty of love toward one another is to help each other thrive. And
that may mean helping some get out of debt slavery so that they may do
the same for others later. This is what the early church did in addressing
financial needs among members: they looked at their assets and saw
them as resources to help others rather than as private property to be
protected from others. Some even sold property in order to help their
sisters and brothers in need. And I am telling you today is that if you are
in debt despair of any kind, your church is kind. We are not a bank, but
we are a family of faith, and families help family members. Let me be
clear, though: we will expect you to do your part. We are not here to
enable perpetual neediness. We are here to help you attain responsible
financial freedom.
Let’s quickly distinguish among types of debt. Not all debt is equal or
evil. Debt can leverage growth that can profit many. If you have a
business that employs people and wants to expand, you may need a loan
to do that. That debt may create conditions for prosperity that build the
wellbeing of many. Bankers or investors will want to make sure that
there is a reasonable chance of your paying back that debt so that
neither they nor you are left holding the bag. Similarly, because of our
tax code, housing debt is often a positive aid in building generational
wealth. A home mortgage—as long as it is within reason—can be
positive because it helps you build equity over time. Similarly, student
loans can enable you to get a low-cost education that will produce many
times more earnings over a lifetime than those without a college or
graduate degree. Even these loans can become oppressive and need to
be retired. But the biggest problem is consumer debt. That is personal
debt that is often put on credit cards, or— worst of all—loans taken out
at payday or auto-title lending stores, which charge exorbitant interest,
mostly through fees.
If you owe debt on a credit card that you can’t pay off in full each month,
you’re in trouble. It is the interest you’re paying that is enslaving. Too
many people can’t pay off their balances because they can afford to pay
only the interest each month—which is just fine for the credit-card
company, but it is never fine for the debtor. If you are in that position,
that debt is a slavery that robs you of freedom to use your work and 
4
your resources for others. It has to end if you are going to know the full
meaning of God’s redemption.
Now it may be that you had a terrible life circumstance that required
money you didn’t have, so you had to borrow it: it could include
extended unemployment, a medical emergency, or a household or car
repair that got you under water. There’s nothing shameful about that,
even if you might have prepared better for it by creating an emergency
fund. But sometimes consumer debt is a product of wanting things
today that are beyond your means to pay for them now. That will kill
you financially, hurt your spirit and harm your relationships with
others.
So first you should stop all unnecessary spending. Second, you should
systematically pay off your debt and get it to zero as quickly as possible,
no matter how hard it is. If you need counseling and advice, we can help.
Come to any of our staff privately, and we will work with you
confidentially and protect your dignity. We can also refer to you those
who will walk you through a plan. There are also free consumer-credit
services in our community that will help.
God doesn’t want some to be masters and others slaves. That seems
obvious to us when we think of whether it’s moral to own people to pick
your cotton. But most slavery in the history of the world is debt slavery
that creates masters and slaves out of neighbors and partners.
Once we take care of our own personal business and our church, we also
have a duty to join Jesus in his jubilee work in the world. Our advocacy
for those who are trapped in debt slavery by unscrupulous lenders is an
act of Christian love. Who else in our society has no other vested
interest than to see those who have been enslaved by exploitive loan
sharks become free?
Most people who take out these loans are trying to be responsible. They
don’t want to go to family or friends for help; they are willing to pay, but
because of bad credit they have to go to these storefront sharks.
Predatory lenders charge our poorest and most desperate neighbors
400 percent or more interest on short-term loans. The Bible calls that
usury, which is a sin against God and humanity. They defend their 
5
business practices by sounding like philanthropists who are helping the
most vulnerable in our society who have poor credit and need shortterm
help. But their actual practices are designed not to help but to
entrap. They do everything in their power to keep debtors enslaved, and
the result is crushing to families and ultimately destructive to the
economy, too. What’s worse, some politicians defend this practice in the
name of free- market capitalism. But if they were so reputable, the
industry wouldn’t need to line the pockets of politicians to stay in
business.
Defeating debt that enslaves people is a spiritual duty in the
commonwealth of Christ and for the sake of our neighbors. Happily, our
efforts are bearing fruit, as Kathryn Freeman has told you today. And
you can help by your prayers and advocacy. Some of you can even help
in your own world of business, such as a friend of mine who told me that
he is buying a strip shopping center that has a payday lending store.
Because of what he has learned about their business practices, he will
not renew the store’s lease at any price.
What we all should want is for there to be no want. There wasn’t a needy
person among them, Acts says. Well, that will depend in part on the
decisions of those in need but also on the deeds of their brothers and
sisters.
There’s a story about a man walking to his Cadillac in a parking lot when
he saw a boy about 10 years old staring intently through the windows.
Wondering what he was up to, the man asked him what he was doing.
The boy said he was interested in cars and had read a lot about different
models. The owner talked with the boy, explaining details about this
particular model and style. After a while, the boy asked, Mister, how
much did you pay for this car? The man replied, Nothing. My brother gave
it to me. The boy responded, I wish ... but stopped without finishing. The
man chuckled, You were going to say, ‘I wish I had a brother like that.’
No, I was going to say, ‘I wish I could be a brother like that. You see, sir, I
have a brother who is crippled, and I’d like to do a lot of things for him.
Let’s be brothers and sisters like that to one another. Let’s defeat
crippling debt and strengthen the ties that bind us in Christian love. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",7/24/2016,
"If you have spent much time in church, you have probably heard about the sister
act of Mary and Martha. Sibling rivalry shows up in the Bible, and it shows up in
our families even today. No matter how much brothers and sisters love each
other, there are times when it feels more like competition. The story of Mary and
Martha serves Luke’s purpose by contrasting the sisters. But how?
One track of interpretation contrasts their personalities. Martha is the doer; Mary
the thinker. Parents sometimes favor one personality over another: Why can’t
you be more like your sister? Right? And we resolve all this by saying that there’s
no one personality that Jesus affirms. He’s not so much criticizing Martha in for
being in the kitchen doing things natural to her personality; he’s simply affirming
that Mary’s personality is also acceptable to him.
But that’s mostly our reading modern psychology back into Jesus’ interest. These
days we have all sorts of instruments to test our personalities and make it easier
for us to accept ourselves and our family members or coworkers. There’s the
Myers-Briggs test, the Birkman, the Enneagram, the Strength-Finder, to name a
few. These can be helpful, but that’s not what Luke is doing here.
Then there’s a more spiritual interpretation that says that Martha and Mary
represent two kinds of discipleship: the active and the contemplative. Martha
represents an action-oriented brand of faith that emphasizes service. The church
needs activists who will step up and serve. The church also needs pray-ers,
people who begin in a more passive posture, sitting at the feet of Jesus and
offering ourselves in prayer for the world.
If the house represents the church and the sisters two kinds of leadership in the
church that centers around Jesus, churches need both—servers and pray-ers.
There are churches that tend to be all about mission; they go and do. They are
ready to join the protest line, to stand up for justice, to go halfway around the
world on their vacation time to bear witness to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Those
are good things and I want you to do them. But churches can’t run ahead of their
Lord. We have to sit at Jesus’ feet in worship and be still before we move. We
have to listen and learn in order to get our orders. The church is a spiritual
movement in the world that addresses the way the world is organized. Unless we
listen first to Jesus, we are liable to pursue our own agendas and then ask Jesus
to bless them. We are enlisted in Christ’s service, not the other way round. This
is getting us closer to what Luke wants us to understand.
The key to Luke’s story is the story before it, as well as many stories after it. You
have to ask why Luke alone inserts this little episode in praise of Mary. She has
chosen the better part, which shall not be taken away from her, Jesus says to 
2
Martha who wanted Mary to do what was expected of her as a woman. But Jesus
praises Mary’s pluck and makes her a model of faith. This comes right after Luke
tells us about a surprisingly “good” Samaritan—as if there could be any such
thing. The Samaritan was a model of faith because he too had chosen the better
part, which was to cross the social boundary of Samaritans and Jews to teach us
what it means to love our neighbor as ourselves. In this case, Luke uses Mary as
a model of faith to show us how to love God with all our heart, soul, strength and
mind.
Mary also violates a social and religious boundary. That’s what Martha is upset
about, not that she needed two more hands in the kitchen, even if that’s what she
says. Jesus unmasks this with his response: Martha, Martha—it’s never a good
thing when someone repeats your name like that, don’t you know?! Martha,
Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things; there is need of only one
thing.
So what are the many things she is worried and distracted by, and what is the
one needed thing? The one needed thing is Jesus himself, or more broadly the
reign of God that he himself embodies and is calling the world to. The one
needed thing is a needed way of life that conforms to Jesus’ way of life. And that
way of life calls into question the way we have organized it ourselves. What
Martha is worried and distracted about is the violation of roles for men and
women that she believes are fixed, just like the roles of Jews and Samaritans.
Women were assigned the role of hospitality in Jewish society. They took care of
home and children. Men learned Torah. Men studied. Men were spiritual beings;
women were servants. One strict first-century rabbi, Eliazer, said: If a man gives
his daughter knowledge of the law, it is as though he taught her lechery. Better to
burn the Torah than to teach it to a woman. Lechery? Really? Mary violated a
clear cultural norm by joining the men around Jesus.
If only we had seen the real rub of this text earlier. Maybe we would be closer
today to the kind of church where women and men are considered equal in
spiritual leadership. Yes, we have seen progress in our lifetime. Many women
now answer the call to ministry, and some of our churches bless and encourage
them. That is, until those churches go searching for a new pastor. Then time and
time again we hear the same refrain about how they aren’t sure they’re ready for
that—aren’t sure they can allow a woman to lead spiritually. Martha, Martha!
Mary is rolling over in her grave every time the church uses that logic.
Listen, Mary showed us the way. She showed us that listening to the Lord is like
eating with your ears. Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that
proceeds from the mouth of God.
And when we say man does not live by bread alone, we mean woman too. It’s as
if Luke is telling us that Women’s Lives Matter in the community of Christ. It’s not 
3
that only women’s lives matter; it’s that women’s lives matter too. It’s never been
a question about whether Men’s Lives Matter; so don’t dismiss this by saying that
saying Women’s Lives Matter is divisive since All Lives Matter. All that does is
repress the liberation Jesus is trying to bring and keep the social privilege of
patriarchy in place. No, we need Mary’s defiance in sitting at the feet of Jesus to
see that women’s lives matter equally in the community of Christ, and that they
too are spiritual beings capable of learning to eat with their ears.
There’s nothing wrong with Martha being in the kitchen. There’s nothing wrong
with men being in kitchen too. But we live by food for the belly and food for the
soul both, so we all need to gain nourishment by devouring the word of God. We
eat God’s word by listening to Jesus.
And we listen to Jesus not only by prayer and study, but also often by listening to
one another instead of trying to “Martha” them into our own image. Listening is a
radical spiritual act. It’s a confession that we don’t know everything yet. But
here’s the big truth: listening is also a radical spiritual act because it is always a
betrayal of some sort.
The Samaritan betrayed his people by being a neighbor to the Jew who had
been assaulted by robbers. Mary betrayed her gender by listening to Jesus as if
she were more than the help. No great social change that comes from Jesus will
happen without some courageous act of betrayal.
Kim and I visited Hyde Park in New York on a recent trip. That’s where Franklin
Roosevelt’s homestead and presidential library are. Kim was especially taken by
a wall of letters in the atrium of the library, some of them terribly harsh in
criticizing FDR’s poverty program known as The New Deal. FDR betrayed his
class in advocating for the poor. In the same way, Lyndon Johnson betrayed the
South by signing civil rights legislation. These men listened to the suffering of
others and no long could be complicit in systems that marginalized them.
The church needs to listen as well as talk. When we listen to those who are
suffering or caught in systems of stigmatization, we will be listening for the Jesus
who continually sides with those whom society—including religion—has silenced
or sidelined.
Every time the church has attempted to challenge tradition, those who support
the change are accused of some level of betrayal. And those who can’t support it
sometimes admit that even if they see the point in their head, they can’t bring
themselves to stand up to their parents or friends, or answer to those from other
churches who would criticize them for doing so. And yet, the church does not
begin to look more like the kingdom of heaven that is coming by remaining loyal
to the ways of this world that are passing away. It sometimes takes a courageous
betrayal to be faithful to Christ. 
4
We’ve seen some beautiful examples of that in the past week. Last Friday night
at a prayer and solidarity service at Concord Baptist Church in South Dallas, the
pastor of Watermark Church, Todd Wagner, made the confession that he had
been guilty of not listening to the experience of black people in this country. He
had heard Black Lives Matter as an unnecessary and divisive call. And then he
listened to a black friend and realized he was wrong. He realized it was no
different than his pro-life position in saying that unborn lives matter. He doesn’t
mean by that that already born lives don’t matter, only that unborn lives matter,
too.
Then we heard from Black Lives Matter movement people. They grieved with the
police who had lost five officers. And they acknowledged that their protests
should be directed only toward abusive officers and not all law enforcement.
Then at the memorial service for one of the slain officers, Sgt. Michael Smith, an
undercover officer whose face was concealed, said these remarkable words to
African Americans: I’m so very sorry that you felt as if your voice, your opinion
and your life did not matter to us. I am sorry for the misdeeds and wrongs of the
few in my profession over the years that have caused and created this distrust,
fear and anger towards law enforcement... We cannot fight the criminals and also
the people we have sworn to protect. You do matter.1
And then you may have heard about the protest and counter-protest near
NorthPark Mall last week in the wake of the shootings. Two groups faced off
across the street from one another for more than an hour—Black Lives Matter
and a group waving American and Texas flags, at least one man wearing a
Confederate flag shirt. They shouted at each other. And then the leaders decided
to meet each other and talk. They actually listened to each other. And after a
while they embraced and declared their mutual understanding and love. Then
they invited the police to join them, and they huddled together and prayed for
each other.
In every case, those who listened were risking accusations of betrayal from their
Marthas. But Jesus would tell us they chose the better part, because they had
learned to eat with their ears. And the world is a little closer to peace because of
it. And a little closer to Jesus. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",7/17/2016,
"We have a saying in the pastoral residency program: This is what
we do. What we mean is that we don’t get to choose what we do
most of the time. The times choose us.
This is one of those times. I tried to choose. My dad died last week. I
switched preaching weeks with Matthew Broyles last Sunday so I
could grieve with my family. Then when I realized that the assigned
gospel text today was The Good Samaritan, I remembered that I
preached my candidating sermon on that topic 27 years ago this
month. I pulled the file and titled the sermon the same as then. I
figured I might reuse some words from then so that I could find
some new words for my dad’s memorial. No such luck. The times
choose us.
We are wordsmiths, preachers are. And sometimes the weight of
the times pushes our capacity to produce them. But as Shakespeare
had Edmund say at the close of King Lear: The weight of this sad
time we must obey. Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
I’m really not sure what I ought to say in this moment, so I’ll just go
with what I feel. With this caveat: it really doesn’t matter what I feel
or you feel in the end, since we can all privilege our feelings and
remain as far from eternal life as the lawyer who questioned Jesus
about who his neighbor is. What matters, Jesus tells us, has less to
do with what we feel than with what we do.
Do this and you will live, Jesus says. DO this—not FEEL this.
Let’s probe more deeply. The man came to Jesus and asked an
existential question. I won’t question his sincerity. Lots of people
asked Jesus insincere questions designed to trap him, but there’s
no indication of that here. He wants to know what we all want to
know: What must I DO to inherit eternal life?
Now, it will not do for us to say, Oh, that’s the wrong question, sir.
You don’t have to DO anything to inherit eternal life. That would 
make your salvation about works, not faith. All that’s required is to
change the way you feel in your hearts. Faith is about the heart, not
deeds. It’s about a change in attitude, not a change in action. It’s
more us than Jesus. Jesus is closer to his brother James here, who
said, Faith without works is dead. Show me your faith without your
works and I will show you my faith by my works (Jas. 2:17-18).
And we know this problem this week, don’t we? I can’t tell you how
many times I’ve heard the question asked by people, including
reporters, Ok, now that you black and white ministers and churches
have gotten together in a big show of unity after this tragedy, what’s
going to be different? How will things change? What they’re asking
is sincere. We can have all the kumbaya, feel-good moments of
prayer services and press conferences, and we can profess our love
and unity to one another, but where are the works that go with that?
Is loving our neighbor only a feeling of sweetness and light, or are
there genuine relationships being built that are based on deeds that
produce respect and that show up in changes in the way we do
government and school and business and family and
neighborliness?
Well, yes, I have said this week time and time again that there is
something different going on in Dallas. What I have seen in race
relations this week and in relations of law enforcement and the
public they serve is different. That difference is not about what just
happened, though; it’s based on what has been happening.
What’s truly ironic and therefore doubly tragic about the murders of
those five police and DART officers the other night is how civil and
respectful the police and protesters were toward one another. The
Dallas Police Department was tweeting photographs of officers and
protestors with their arms around one another, demonstrating
mutual respect and unity.
The reason for the protests was not so much local as national. And,
frankly, that’s also the reason behind the shooter’s motives. We no
longer live from local to global; we live “glocally,” to coin a Bill
O’Brien word. We live in a glocal village where whatever happens
anywhere is felt everywhere. 
3
It’s not that we don’t have lingering problems of racism and white
privilege here in Dallas; we do. What’s different is that we have been
acknowledging it and working on it. We’ve been doing more than
just giving the superficial nod of brotherhood while leaving in place
structures of division that keep us passing by life on the other side of
the road.
Police Chief David Brown has modeled for the nation these past
three years all sorts of training in the use of lethal force, in sensitivity
to diversity, in community policing. He’s taken lots of criticism for
overdoing it, but when we saw Thursday night a black woman with
two little children in a stroller protesting on the street, a white police
officer bent over and gave her little girl a white rose. Soon after that
the shooting started, and the woman was interviewed, telling her
story about how she wants her child to remember the rose more
than the bullets because most of the time that’s what characterizes
the relationship between people and the police. That’s different.
When you have a mayor who faces things like this head on, makes
no attempt to justify himself or our city’s history, but instead
encourages programs like Dallas Faces Race, that’s different. When
you have a city council that pays attention to preserving the integrity
of middle-class neighborhoods and doesn’t want to make the
mistakes of the past, such as where we place our roads and
highways, and a council that cares about South Dallas as much as
North Dallas to the extent that after agreeing to a $3 million tax
subsidy for Costco in the north, a councilman from the north insisted
on the same amount being designated to bring a grocery store to
the food deserts of the south, that’s different.
And when it comes to pastors and churches, the only reason we’ve
had this kind of turnout for unity is that it’s been a work of respect
and trust that’s been underway for several years now. Churches
black and white, north and south, have joined for worship and
community action, and it is changing Dallas. This is what our New
Baptist Covenant relationship with Friendship West Baptist Church
has been about. Its pastor, Freddy Haynes, and I do not want to
pretend we are brothers if we do not work together on something
that matters to the man in the ditch. We don’t want to sing and pray
while we pass by on the other side, ignoring the battered and the 
4
bruised and the broken and the bitter. Our members have reached
out to one another in friendship and action. We are all being
changed by that.
But it’s more than feelings being different. We are seeing the
predatory practices of payday lending being changed, too. People
who have been exploited, like that man going down the Jericho
Road who fell in among thieves, have been cared for and protected
against future abuse. We have a long way to go, but it isn’t just
about feeling all warm and fuzzy toward our neighbor.
And get this—it isn’t about charity that reaches out to the man in the
ditch after he’s been robbed and maimed; it’s about seeing to it that
it doesn’t happen again to him or anyone else. It’s about working on
the conditions of that road, the policing of it, the guardrails and soft
shoulders and emergency telephones on it. It’s about building a
community that is safe and courteous and provides opportunities for
people to succeed on their own merits. That last part takes an
honest assessment of whether the assets for success are fairly
distributed to all by our common decision-making, and without
regard to where or to whom you were born or where you live. There
are things people have to do for themselves—things we all have to
do for ourselves. But there are things we have to do together, too, to
make sure the efforts of individuals, families and businesses can
thrive.
And what I am telling you is that these things have been happening
and are happening and will continue to happen because we none of
us want to be the villains in the story Jesus told. We none of us want
to pass by life on the other side of the road. We want to experience
eternal life, and we are discovering that we can’t do that alone; we
can only do that together with our neighbor.
Remember who these two were who passed by on the other side.
They were a priest and a Levite. They were pastors and deacons,
don’t you know?! They were people who were scrupulous about
their religion, who paid most of their attention to the “loving God”
part of the Great Commandment. The loving neighbor part—now
that was more complicated. 
5
Here’s why it was complicated— because as human nature would
have it, we like to define neighbors as people like us. The closer
they are to us, the more neighbor they are. And over time, Israel had
come to narrow its definition of neighbor to fellow Israelites. It was a
common debate among rabbis of the day: Who is my neighbor? And
Jesus weighs in with the most extreme definition in his story of the
Good Samaritan.
The man in the ditch is presumably a fellow Jew, but not a very
bright or responsible one. The man was walking alone on the
notoriously dangerous Jericho Road. What happened was
unfortunate, but he should have known better. The priest and the
Levite probably thought as much when they saw him. They saw a
fellow Israelite, but hardly one worthy of their compassion. They saw
him, but they really didn’t see him. They saw someone who should
have known better, who should have done better, who shouldn’t
have been needing their help. See what they were doing? What we
are all prone to do in times like these: blame the victim. In other
words, they saw him as other than them instead of seeing him as
another of them.
We do this all the time. Micah Johnson “othered” all white law
enforcement. Ironically, he did the very thing he was angry at white
people and police for doing—generalizing about black people, not
seeing their common humanity. The problem cuts in every direction
in our society. Whoever you are, you have to ask whether you can
see yourself in someone else or only see the else in someone.
The Good Samaritan saw the man, and by seeing him he saw
himself. He himself was acquainted with being despised and
rejected; he knew what it meant to be other. Samaritans were
considered dirty traitors to Jews. They had intermarried with pagan
locals in Palestine after being left behind in the Babylonian Exile.
And they returned hate for hate. Just 30 years earlier, Samaritans
had terrorized the Temple in Jerusalem, breaking into the Holy of
Holies, carving their initials in the walls, and leaving a pile of dead
human bones on the floor.
Samaritans were others to Jews, and Jews to Samaritans. But
instead of trying to justify himself, the Samaritan was justified 
himself by showing mercy. Here’s what he said: There is no other;
there is only one another. Or as Frederick Buechner puts it: There
can never really be any peace and joy for me until there [are] peace
and joy finally for you too.
If you want to inherit eternal life, don’t pass by life on the other side.
Side with one another on this side; and when you get to the other
side, you will have inherited eternal life for sure. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",7/10/2016,
"For freedom Christ has set us free.
With Independence Day weekend upon us soon, we’ll be hearing a
lot about freedom. However, those seven short words from Galatians
have become a virtual motto for Baptists since our beginnings. In fact,
freedom by itself is the one word that could stand in for the name
Baptist.
Many of us just returned from the annual General Assembly meeting
of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. It was held in Greensboro,
N.C., this year. We celebrated our silver anniversary—25 years of
CBF. Hard to believe for those of us who were there at its creation. A
book of brief commemorating this milestone essays has been
published. I contributed a chapter that talked about how freedom has
been our watchword from the start. Yet we have come to a richer and
riper understanding of what freedom means during our quarter of a
century of life together.
At the start, freedom meant for us liberation from slavery to a way of
being Christian that had been infected with legalism. Fundamentalism
had stormed the gates of every agency and institution of the Southern
Baptist Convention. Fundamentalist leaders knew exactly what every
true Baptist should believe and how every true Baptist should
behave, and they weren’t shy about saying so.
They required allegiance to their brand of believing and behaving, or
Baptists like us were no longer welcome in that branch of the family
of faith. They claimed they believed the Bible and that those who
disagreed with them about certain things didn’t just disagree with
them; they—and those who didn’t, don’t you know?!—disagreed with
God.
To give you a sampling of what was going on back then, here are
some of the things we disagreed about: women, divorce, pastoral
authority and religious liberty, to name just a few. And amazingly,
these are still some of our disagreements. They say that wives have 
2
to submit to their husbands’ authority over them; women are not
permitted to teach men in adult Sunday school; a church cannot
ordain a woman to ministry, call a woman to be its pastor, or even
allow a woman to preach from the pulpit. Divorced persons are
automatically disqualified from leadership in the church; the pastor is
the ruler of the church, and each member submits to God’s authority
by submitting to his authority; and finally, the separation of church
and state really applies only to the state not interfering with the
church, whereas the church is free to politic as much as it wants to
and still retain its tax-free status.
Many of us couldn’t abide by these interpretations of our Baptist faith,
and we didn’t agree that this point of view put us at odds with God.
We believed that it was an example in our time of how we were in
danger of giving up the freedom for which Christ had set us free. We
could not allow ourselves to be enslaved to certain leaders and their
teaching. The Apostle Paul made it clear that this was not the
direction of freedom. Stand firm, therefore, he says, and do not
submit again to a yoke of slavery.
In Galatians 5, Paul is addressing a similar circumstance. Gentiles
had come to faith in Jesus and were thereby freed from slavery to
idolatry and to ridiculous notions of how the gods of nature controlled
their lives. The gospel allowed them to see their great worth and
dignity as beloved children of the one and only true God who loved
them—listen to me now—just the way they were. The grace was
unconditional. There was no deal to be made by which they had to do
something first. God wanted nothing from them except their love in
return, and their turn toward their neighbor in love. Period.
Then along came the Judaizers, and the music changed. At this point
in the story, if it were a TV movie or a motion picture, the musical
score would let us know that something foul was entering the picture.
Judaizers said it was great to know that Gentiles had accepted their
acceptance in Jesus Christ, but rules are rules. They just can’t go
changing what the Bible says to suit themselves. They couldn’t pick
and choose what they liked and didn’t like. So if Gentiles were going
to be accepted among the people of God, they would have to be
circumcised and also change their eating habits by keeping kosher.
They would have to become Jewish converts in order to be 
3
Christians. They would have to follow all of the laws of Moses;
otherwise they couldn’t know the salvation of Christ.
Mark Wingfield captured this contemporary Judaizing spirit in the
church with this immortal phrase in a column about transgender
persons: We say come as you are, but we really mean come as we
are. Paul said a long and loud NO to that. Being Christian sets us free
from putting anything else before grace.
Likewise, Cooperative Baptists’ first understanding of freedom was
freedom from slavery to a legalistic and restrictive way of
understanding our faith. Freedom meant freedom from a
fundamentalism that told everyone what they had to believe and how
they had to behave in order to be in fellowship with Christ and his
church.
This is the first move of freedom. We are welcomed by God as
beloved children of God, not because of what we do or even because
of who we are in ourselves. We are welcomed because of who God
is. And Christ is the one who liberates us from slavery to rules and
laws and traditions that squeeze the life out of us. This is what the
preacher King Duncan calls the tyranny of bad religion. Religion is not
a cage to keep us in so that we will do no wrong; it is a way of life that
changes us from within so that we can do what’s right.
Radio commentator Paul Harvey once told about a group of scientists
who were determined to teach a chimpanzee to write. For fourteen
years, the scientists labored diligently and patiently with this
chimpanzee, providing things in its cage to enable it to form certain
syllables. Finally, the day arrived when it seemed that the
chimpanzee was actually going to construct a sentence from the
symbols it had been learning. The word went out, and other scientists
crowded into the room and gathered around the cage. The scientists
could hardly contain themselves as they pressed around the cage to
read the history-making sentence. Here is what the chimpanzee had
written: “Let me out!” When you come to faith in Christ, you should first get the feeling that
you’ve been let out of a cage of sorts. You are no longer imprisoned
by the dehumanizing powers of those whose human judgments hold
power over you. But you are not just freed from dependency to
others, making you an independent self with no obligations to others.
That is a kind of freedom that our society often celebrates, but it ends
in a slavery to self.
Paul went on to say that we should not use our freedom as an
opportunity for self-indulgence. Dependency can be external or
internal. Freedom from the tyranny of sin is also a part of freedom.
Christ has not set us free simply to gratify our selfish instincts. The list
of sins of the flesh that we read in our text is about self-indulgence
with no thought about their impact on others. And those very things
actually end up undermining our ability to love ourselves as God
loves us. They take hold of us and won’t let us go. We are not truly
free until we are able not to do what will hurt us and others. Christ’s
freedom works within us to give us the courage and the strength to be
whom God has made us to be.
It’s interesting to note that while the works of the flesh are plural, the
fruit of the Spirit is singular. Paul lists all these ways in which we
gratify ourselves, and in doing so we tear ourselves apart. But he
doesn’t consider love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity,
faithfulness, gentleness and self-control to be nine things; they are all
one fruit of the Spirit. They are not fruits; they are fruit. All of these
things characterize the freedom of life in the Spirit.
I love the line that follows this list of the fruit of the Spirit: There is no
law against such things. That’s because such things spring from a
freedom that transcends law. They come from love, and they all focus
on loving others.
Independence can be only another kind of dependence.
Independence from the rule of others can turn into a dependence on
the rule of self. And that is not the direction of true freedom.
Paul says that the whole law is summarized in this single
commandment: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. So here’s a
handy rule: If your religion somehow drives people away from you or 
5
drives you away from people, you’d better check to see if you have
left Jesus out of your religion. Said another way, if your freedom is
used to deny or diminish the freedom of someone else, you’d better
check to see whether it’s authentic Christianity.
If we are loving our neighbor as ourselves, freedom is neither
dependence nor independence; it is interdependence: I need you and
you need me. Martin Luther King, Jr., said: Justice denied anywhere
is a threat to justice everywhere. We could paraphrase him this way:
freedom denied anywhere is a threat to freedom everywhere. I am
only as free as you are, because our lives are tied together in the
body of Christ. This means, in the end, that my freedom depends
upon your freedom, and your freedom depends upon mine. I can’t
conceive of my life as being my own because, as Paul says, Those
who belong to Christ have crucified selfish desires. We live now by
the Spirit and are guided by the Spirit. And that Spirit does not
engage in competition in which there are winners and losers, but
rather we live for each other.
This is why our language has changed over the years in CBF. Instead
of only talking about freedom, we have come to talk about being free
and faithful Baptists. We care about freedom from legalism and
freedom from sin and self, but our focus now is on what we do with
our freedom. And the answer is that we use it rightly. We use it to
advocate freedom for others. We use it to love and serve our
neighbors here and abroad. We care most about freedom for and
with others. This is why missions has always been and always will be
at the center of Cooperative Baptist life.
Ed Freeman was presented with the Medal of Honor in 2009 by
President George W. Bush for his heroism during the Vietnam War.
Ed was a helicopter pilot during a particularly fierce battle. Troops on
the ground were running out of ammunition and many were injured
and believed they were facing the day of their death. The machinegun
fire of the enemy was so devastating that the medicalevacuation
helicopters were told to stand down. Ed Freeman couldn’t
live with his own personal safety while his dying and injured brothers
were trapped by the Viet Cong. He flew by himself into the midst of
the battle 14 times, taking heavy fire but rescuing dozens of men who
would otherwise have died. When those abandoned men heard the 
sound of those rotary blades overhead, they heard in their whirling a
song of salvation and freedom.2
I tell you, unless we are standing for and serving with those who do
not yet know the full freedom of faith in Christ or welcome in the body
of Christ, we ourselves are not yet free.
The direction of freedom is found in the face of your neighbor. 
",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",6/26/2016,
"“What are you doing here?”
It’s a simple question that feels like a right hook to the soul standing
before the God of the universe. Going toe-to-toe with God is more
terrifying than boxing with the late Muhammad Ali.
This morning we find the Prophet Elijah on the ropes. What was he doing
there in that sanctuary-like cave? He just contended like a champ against
the priests of Baal. He should be speaking truth with confidence, not
hiding like a scaredy-cat.
But right now he feels helpless. He has thrown in the towel. He’s tired of
fighting for change.
Elijah has been a prophet for a long time but even in his fatigue and
frustration he is still hungry for change and angry at the broken world
around him.
Have you ever been so hungry that you became angry?
This can happen in worship on Sunday mornings. Sometime around
11:45, you start to get hungry, even starving, for Sunday lunch. Then you
start getting angry at the preacher who still has another ten minutes left in
her sermon.
This painful experience has a name; it’s called “hangry.”
Urban Dictionary defines “hangry” as “when you are so hungry that your
lack of food causes you to become angry, frustrated or both.”
“Hanger” is a reality we all face but know this, you are not alone.
This morning, the prophet Elijah is “hangry.” But this is not a superficial,
first-world “hanger.”
He’s not sitting at a restaurant, waiting impatiently, getting angry at the
poor food service.
No. He is hungry like a boxer hungers for an upcoming fight. Before the
boxers enter the ring, they must weigh-in which means they have to fast
for several days in order to get into their weight bracket. Elijah is fasting in the desert and goes to bed hungry. Then an angel of the
Lord wakes him up and gives him food for the long fight ahead.
But his hunger runs deeper than his stomach. He is starving for justice
and furious at what is happening in his country. The Israelites are
worshipping their wealth, ignoring the helpless and closing their ears to
the cries of victims stuck in cycles of poverty and injustice.
This outspoken prophet finds himself a victim on the run, hiding from King
Ahab and his deadly wife Jezebel.
But this is nothing new--victims being forced into hiding, voices crying for
justice silenced by the aggressors of the world.
The world has been broken and bullied for a very long time. Every country
and culture is full of predators who are always devouring their prey for
more power.
This morning, let’s look at two power hungry political leaders who are
currently on all our minds…King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. Oh, you may
have been thinking of two different politicians...
The stories of the prophet Elijah are interwoven with the political and
religious history of the Israelite people.
Following the death of King Solomon, son of King David, the kingdom of
Israel was split into two pieces, the north and the south.
King Ahab has been ruling in the northern kingdom at this time and has
already made several poor political decisions. One major choice was
cementing his alliance with their Phoenician neighbors by marrying their
king’s daughter.
Her name was Jezebel, meaning “a wicked or shameless woman.”
Jezebel is a name every father wants to give his daughter. She brought to
Israel her zealous religious piety towards the fertility god, Baal.
At this point in the story she has left a trail of victims who were a threat to
her power in the world.
But let’s be real. Elijah isn’t an innocent victim here. No, if he hadn’t been
in that part of the kingdom at that moment wearing his long wool robe,
flashing his prophetic power around, Jezebel would not be attacking him.
Then again, victim blaming is a low blow, a sucker punch used to silence
the innocent and distract us from the guilty. These deceitful statements twist truth, harm souls and are reasons why
the voices of victims need to be heard.
This story of Elijah is about people of faith trying to find the way, the truth
and the life in a boxing ring culture where power is given to loudest voice.
Watching those who use power like a weapon, brutally beating down the
weak with violence, should cause a visceral reaction within us.
Sympathy is a nice way of acknowledging a person’s pain from a distance.
But empathy requires a deep, intimate connection that moves us towards
another human.
This deep connection grips our inner humanity. Horrifying events like we
watched occur in Orlando a week ago should knock us out of our
everyday realities. We cannot be numb hearing about shootings and rape.
We need to be angry and hungry for justice and peace.
With all the violence and brokenness in our world, we need to embrace
some “hanger” management.
In my experience the way to work through “hanger” management is
learning how to box. And the best boxer to learn from is the late
Muhammad Ali.
Ali was the ultimate fighter. He was a genius talent who started his training
at age twelve and won his first Light Heavyweight gold medal in the 1960
Olympics in Rome. He was an American Olympian, a professional boxer
and an activist for civil rights.
Every good boxer has a deep hunger that inspires everyone around them.
Ali fought with a ferocious appetite inside and outside of the ring. He stood
up for the helpless and projected the voices of the voiceless. His hunger
for justice in the world made him a legend.
As people of faith, we hunger for justice.
This week, when you scroll through Facebook or when you turn on the
nightly news, take an honest look into yourself.
When you hear about rape, child hunger, another shooting--what happens
deep inside of you?
Hearing devastating news can be paralyzing. The shock and horror of it all
can catch us off guard leaving us standing still with our mouth wide open. Several years ago, my therapist encouraged me to find a healthy outlet for
my anger. I decided to take boxing lessons. Being part Irish, I figured I’d
be a natural.
My second lesson with a very enthusiastic, muscular woman made me
realize this boxing thing may have been a bad idea.
Half way through a class learning proper punching form and the ‘bob and
weave’ technique, I’m ducking as the trainer swings her glove over my
head. Then all of sudden my bobbing and weaving stops working and I
take a right hook to the jaw.
The punch shocks me and knocks me back. Then I remember my TMJ
problems as my jaw locks open. For the rest of the day I sat on the couch
paralyzed with my mouth locked open.
When the world gives us a good right hook we can either lock up or learn
to roll with the punches. This requires training your soul.
Soul searching is great training that leads us out into the wilderness, like
the prophet Elijah, for spiritual direction.
The wilderness is important for soul health. The desert is a spiritual detox
flushing out our steady diet of adrenaline and busyness that only creates a
coma of spiritual apathy. A good detox causes deep hunger.
Our very beings are created in the image of God and crave wholeness, a
holiness that heals and nourishes.
Elijah must feast on divine food in order to have strength for the next forty
days. God’s peace is the only sustainable meal that nourishes us for the
long road towards justice.
But feasting on peace is harder to digest than the easy servings of fear we
get on the news every day.
We want peace to pop out of a vending machine whenever we feel the
first pains of hunger. Unlike fear, peace is not some prepackaged snack,
rather peace is more like a Texas peach tree.
Once you plant your peach tree you have to not only wait for it to grow but
you have to wait another six years after the first fruits bloom before the
peaches are even edible.
Waiting for justice to grow and fruits of peace to produce seems painfully
slow. This is frustrating and maddening. It makes us angry.
Just as a peach farmer fights for every peach, as people of faith we fight
for every person with a righteous anger. But we don’t fight alone. We are not the sole beings in this universe
ushering justice into the world.
Elijah was not the first prophet to experience God on that mountain.
Moses was there hundreds of years before leading the Israelite people to
the Promised Land. Elijah won’t be the last prophet. Elisha is already
preparing to take his place.
When Elijah finally decides stops his pity-party, God speaks.
The hurricane winds blow against the mountain, splitting rocks. Elijah
huddles in the darkness of the cave. The earth begins to shake and he
clings to a wall. Fire erupts like a volcano and he shields his face from the
sweltering flames.
Then a stillness settles, the air hangs heavy and Elijah opens his eyes.
Silence.
A faint whisper tickles his ears.
A fiery, flashy God is restrained and understated. Now, God has a silent
message.
It’s difficult to hear the silence. Silence feels nauseating in a loud, chaotic
world. You know, for such a noisy culture we do a good job of silencing
people.
But then we remember that the Spirit of God hovered over the chaotic
waters, that the Creator God spoke out into the darkness and that the Son
of God descended into the depths. This God uses the silence to bring forth
peace into the world.
Silent voices are often heard loudest in the midst of death.
Billy Crystal delivered a eulogy at Muhammad Ali’s funeral a few weeks
ago. He spoke highly of his dear friend who even after he was stripped of
his title still fought for justice and peace.
One day Ali invited him to go workout early in the morning at a certain
country club. Crystal told him, “I can’t go there. That country club has a
reputation for being restrictive, meaning no Jews are allowed.” Ali was
furious. He said to Crystal, “I’m a black Muslim and they let me run there. I
am never going to run there again.” And he didn’t. Crystal said, “Throughout his life, Ali was a silent messenger of peace. He
taught us that life is lived best when you build bridges between people, not
walls.”
Ali was one of the most powerful people in his time and he chose to be a
silent messenger, living in peace in the midst of violence.
The violence of this world screams at us every day. But then the silent
messengers from heaven give us encouragement and direction.
God encourages us out of our sanctuary-like caves and back into the
world. In verse fifteen God says to Elijah, “Go, return on your way.”
Go. Get back out there in the world.
As the messenger from heaven offered Elijah bread for the journey, I am
reminded of Billy Crockett’s lyrics to his song Traveling Mercies:
Take bread for the journey
And strength for the fight
Comfort to sleep through the night
Wisdom to choose at the fork in the road
And a heart that knows the way home.
God offers us all traveling mercies as we remember that peace is not a
call to be silent but a silent call to go.
This morning as you go on your way,
Go in peace. Live in grace.
Trust in the arms that will hold you.
Go in peace. Live in grace.
Trust God’s love. Amen.",Erica Whitaker,"Dallas, TX",6/19/2016,
"I’ve always thought it awkward when I go to other churches. When
we say the Lord’s Prayer and come to that part where we ask
forgiveness, what do we say after forgive us our – do we say
trespasses, debts or sins? Ever have that experience? Episcopalians
say trespasses, and that figures, since they were often the landed
gentry back in the day. Presbyterians say debts, and they often were
the bankers, so that would fit. Here at Wilshire we say sins, because,
well, Baptists are common folk, just plain old sinners.
Our story today from Luke’s Gospel has Jesus making a connection
between sins and debts. So we need to look more closely at it to get
the sense of things.
Jesus has been healing the sick and raising the dead in the episodes
just preceding this one. The question is whether he is a prophet, and
Luke keeps showing us that while he may be a prophet in people’s
eyes, he is much more than that. This story drives home the point
when Jesus boldly declares a woman forgiven of her sins.
The scene is scandalous. Simon is a well-respected Pharisee who
invites Jesus to his home for a dinner party. Jesus doesn’t turn away
an invitation to a meal. He’s just been criticized for eating and
drinking with sinners. Now he goes to eat and drink with a man
whom no one, including himself, would consider a sinner.
So there they are at table. Actually, it wouldn’t be a table with chairs;
the food would have been spread on the floor with cushions all
around. Everyone would recline on the floor with their left arms, with
pillows supporting the weight of their bodies and eating with their
right hands. Their legs would have been sprawled out behind them
away from the table.
Although this is a private dinner party, the house is likely open, and
people are crowded around outside, looking in on the proceedings. All
at once a woman appears, uninvited. A hush comes over the room.
She’s a woman they all know—a woman of ill repute, as we say. She 
2
takes her place at Jesus’ feet, let’s down her hair and begins to weep
with such force that her tears wet Jesus’ feet. She dries his feet with
her hair and begins to pour perfume on them as an act of lavish love.
This is not how the host saw the evening going, and he is aghast.
Simon thinks Jesus must not be a prophet after all, because if he were,
he would have known what kind of woman she was and would never
have let her near him or touch him, lest he be contaminated by her
impurity. A true man of God would have avoided people like her. And
yet Jesus sits there and lets her do her thing. Admittedly, this action
would have looked bad. This woman knows how to make men pay
attention to her, and she is doing just that to Jesus. Simon makes it
clear that she’s a sinner, and that’s when Jesus tells the parable of the
two debtors.
Now, there’s an easy way to look at this that’s too easy. At first
blush—and there was probably some literal blushing going on there,
don’t you know?!—we might say, Well, there goes the Pharisee being a
Pharisee. He’s judging her the way the hypocrite Pharisees always
judge. Jesus doesn’t judge. He accepts her as she is and doesn’t turn her
away. That’s what we have to do in the church. We have to stop judging
people and pointing out people’s sins and just accept all people as they
are.
But is that fair? I mean, Jesus doesn’t deny that she’s a sinner, and the
church isn’t judging people just because we acknowledge that people
are sinners. This is a common fallacy: suggesting that the church is
either supposed to always be talking about sin or never talking about
it. The church should care about being a holy people; we’re not trying
to be a permissive body in which anything goes. The whole thing
about not judging is a secular critique of the church by people who
think we should give up the business of naming sin and just live and
let live. But the New Testament idea of not judging doesn’t mean that.
It means that we shouldn’t be looking to write people off because of
their sins. We want righteousness, but everyone has to start
somewhere, and no one ever arrives. We’re all in process. We all are
always sinners. All of us.
And that’s where Jesus’ parable is going to take us. But before we get
there, let’s think about who this woman is. The story makes it pretty 
3
clear her sin is sexual. She isn’t the town gossip. She’s a harlot. And
sexual sin is for some reason always a preoccupation with us religious
people.
But how did she become a harlot? Do we ever really think about that?
Did she wake up one day and say to herself, You know, I really like sex,
and I think I can make a pretty good living giving men what they want.
I’ll become a prostitute. Yeah, that’s it; I’ve found my calling.
In that day, as in ours, most women who resort to a life of prostitution
do so because they think they have no other viable options. Women in
Jesus’ day were under the care of either their fathers or their
husbands. If they were on their own because they were kicked out of
the house or their husbands had abandoned them, they had no real
choice but to sell themselves. Even today, most prostitutes and porn
actresses do so because they have been sexually abused, and/or they
are runaways, and mostly they are desperate. The average American
girl who enters the sex trade is 13 years old. She spends no more than
48 hours on the street before she is approached by a pimp who
promises to take care of her in exchange for her selling herself. In an
article in this month’s Advocate magazine in Dallas, we are told that
about 400 girls are trafficking on our city streets each night. They are
expected to bring in about $1,000 a night to their slave masters. It’s a
seedy and dangerous life. And stopping it has become a constant
problem for law enforcement.
Recently, Jimmy Carter wrote a piece for the Washington Post
proposing a change in the way we address the matter: he offers the
so-called Nordic model, which is practiced in places like Sweden, that
treats women caught in this web of sleaze as victims who need a hand
getting out rather than a handcuff leading to jail. This proven way
goes after the men who pay for these girls and those who profit from
them—in other words, the johns and the pimps. If you like marketbased
solutions to problems, this makes sense. If demand dries up,
things will change. But we always blame the women, not the men who
engage in these demeaning tricks or those who treat them as sex
slaves.
There’s a beautiful ministry in Dallas called New Friends, New Life,
that is helping to rescue girls from this life and give them back their 
4
sense of dignity and hope for a better tomorrow. Christians have an
opportunity to challenge human trafficking and live up to our calling
of giving good news to those who are trapped in these terrible
circumstances.
Now back to the story in the Scripture. Jesus tells Simon a parable
about debts. Sex and money are the two things we most closely relate
to when it comes to sin. The woman is associated with sex, but the
rich male Pharisee would have related more closely to money. So
Jesus asks the man whether the debtor whose great debts are
forgiven or the one whose small debts are forgiven would be more
grateful. The one whose debts are greatest, he replies. And he’s right.
Notice what Jesus does. He doesn’t deny that she is a sinner, but he
implies that Simon is, too, but that he doesn’t see himself as a sinner
at all. Just because his sins are fewer than hers in his cultural and
religious understanding doesn’t mean she’s a sinner and he isn’t. It
just means that she understands her sinfulness and he doesn’t.
Here’s the telling question from Jesus to Simon: Do you see this
woman? And of course he doesn’t see THIS woman. He sees a sinner,
not a person. He sees someone messing up his dignified dinner party.
He sees an embarrassing emotional fit that needs to be dealt with by
whisking her away. Jesus sees her. He doesn’t see her sin so much as
he sees her love and her tears.
Vicki Collins is an English professor at Oregon State University. At a
luncheon conversation about the teaching profession, she shared a
story about a teacher who changed her life during high school. Her
teacher’s classroom was located on the side of the building where a
main thoroughfare of the city ran. Traffic was constant, including the
sound of emergency vehicles, throughout each day. At the beginning
of each class, he would complain to the students about the noise. The
sirens of emergency vehicles especially annoyed him.

Then one Monday the teacher addressed the class at the beginning, as
he usually did. This time he apologized to them. He told them that on
the previous weekend, his pregnant wife had had a medical
emergency. The service that the ambulance provided saved her life 
5
and their baby’s life. He told his students, I want to apologize because I
was listening to the noise instead of thinking about the lives.
This is what should concern us about the church. We should be more
worried about whether great sinners feel welcome here than we are
about making sure lesser sinners who look more respectable and will
keep up appearances feel comfortable here. Frankly, both should feel
welcome—and neither comfortable. If you want comfortable, join a
social club. If you want to grow into the likeness of Christ, join a
church and give up the sense of entitlement that you should be
comfortable.
Grace works only on sinners. And sinners of the flesh and sinners of
the spirit are both sinners in need of grace. It’s just that sinners like
this woman know they need grace, and sinners like Simon too easily
forget that they do, too.
In theory, we all want to welcome women and men whom we may see
as great sinners to come to church and find the Lord. But in reality we
tend to want more Simons like us. We want sinners who tacitly and
quietly confess that their small debts are forgiven more than we want
those loud and bawdy types whose great debts are forgiven.
But look at the cost of having a church of mainly Simons: we
experience too little love. Love isn’t easily controlled. It’s a bit of a
bother. There may be tears. There may be scenes. There may be
physical hugs that go on uncomfortably long. Through this woman’s
lavish love—let’s be clear—Jesus is praised.
At the end of the day the real question is whether the church is
primarily in the sin-avoidance business or the sin-forgiving business.
If you go with the former, good luck seeing any great sinners like this
woman showing up among us. She showed up not because Simon was
there, but because Jesus was there. She knew she could count on his
grace. If you go with that “Jesus approach,” get ready for your heart to
be touched and for the love to be touching.
What kind of church do we really want? ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",6/12/2016,
"Two young boys are raised from the dead in our Bible passages
today—one from the Old Testament and one from the New. Both
were the only child of widows. In both cases, the mothers of the
boys are overcome with grief and loss. They face an uncertain
future for themselves. And in each case a man of God steps forward
and brings the dead to life.
Stories like these make us wonder. Did they really happen, because
we don’t see the same thing happening in our day? If they did, why
did they happen then and not now? Sometimes even pastors who
believe the gospel so much that we have committed our lives to
preaching it wonder, Do the dead still rise?
When I was a very young minister, about 25 or so, I was serving as
the singles and college minister at First Baptist Church in Arlington.
A couple I worked with in the singles ministry had an only child, a
boy named Curtis. They had married later in life, and this young boy
was everything to them. And then he got sick. I don’t remember the
diagnosis, but I remember my visit to the hospital. He was in the
intensive care unit. His life was hanging in the balance. His mother
came out to the waiting room to see me. She was raw with emotion.
She told me about his bloated body, about his critical condition and
what the doctors were telling them. She knew her Bible. She told me
she was claiming this story about the prophet Elijah, who lay upon
the dead boy of the widow of Zarephath. She had a charismatic
streak about her faith, believing that if you have enough faith, God
will do whatever you ask. You just have to name it and claim it. She
looked at me and said she believed I was the man of God who was
sent to go into that room and pray over her son to be brought back
from the brink of death. But there was one stipulation. She asked
me whether I truly believed that if I prayed for him, God would raise
him up. She didn’t want me going in there with any doubt in my
heart or praying any weak prayers for comfort or peace. She wanted
her son to rise from the dead. And if I didn’t have enough faith to do
that, she would understand, and I could go my way. 
2
I gulped. I was wishing in that moment that I had had CPE training
with Joe Gross. He would have known what to do. I thought about
trying to talk to her about her theology, but it didn’t seem like the
right time. I considered walking away, since I didn’t think the power
to raise the dead depended upon the amount of faith I had in that
moment. Finally, I told her I would go in there and pray over her son
in faith. I would ask God to raise him up and heal him. That was
good enough for her, I guess. So I did.
I remember the room like it was yesterday. The distraught parents.
The precious little boy and his distended body. The tubes and
machines hooked up to him. The nurses scurrying around. The
feeling of fear and the smell of death. I prayed with all my might. I
claimed the power of the living God and the resurrected Christ.
Curtis died shortly after that. I did his funeral. I consoled myself with
the thought that I had done what I could, and that God still raises the
dead after we die, even if we don’t see that happening miraculously
in the way we want to—where God gives us the life of our loved
ones back when we want it, no matter how much faith we have.
I do a lot of funerals and memorial services in my work. I often begin
them with the words of Jesus from the tomb of Lazarus: I am the
resurrection and life. Those who believe in me, though they are
dead, yet shall they live. And whoever lives and believes in me shall
never die. And yet we do die.
So what about it? Do the dead still rise? Is there a way to think
about this that does justice to the power of God, the stories of Elijah
and Jesus raising the dead and our hopeful yet halting faith?
C. S. Lewis suggested that miracles are not exceptions to the laws
of nature; they are God speeding up nature to do instantaneously
what God is doing all the time over time. In other words, God is
always turning water into wine. It takes water to grow a vine, to feed
the grape, to ripen it and age it after harvesting and processing.
Jesus just accelerated the process in the miracle of Cana. In the
same way, God is always healing the sick and raising the dead.
When Jesus healed some people and raised this boy from Nain, it
was done to reveal that God is at work in the world of sickness and
death to bring health and life all the time. W proclaim in our faith the 
3
resurrection of the dead at the end of all things. We know that Jesus
was brought back for a time to be among us after being raised, so
maybe that and these other times were a matter of God allowing the
end to poke back into our time to give us a hint and to point to how
all things are going to be.
When you think about these Bible stories, you might also consider
that the widow of Zarephath and the widow of Nain lived in a time
when there was no one to call on to prevent their boys’ dying or
even to resuscitate them when they did. Today we have an
incredible legacy of science and medicine to call upon. You call 911,
and an ambulance arrives in minutes. Paramedics may rescue a
dying boy before he stops breathing or do CPR if he has stopped.
And who is responsible for that? We too often think of medicine and
miracles as different things. Sometimes we get well, or a patient
who has died on the operating table is brought back to life, and we
just take it for granted that we brought the person back to life, as
science has given us the tools. Or we thank God for the miracle, as
if God did it without any help from us, when of course, all the right
people and all the right knowledge and all the right technology were
available at just the right time. It’s not one or the other; it’s both.
The sick are healed and the dead still rise. And who is to say that at
Zarephath and Nain that this is not just what happened. The God
who would slowly teach us the mysteries of God’s universe over
millennia of discoveries might have sped up time or anticipated the
future in those two moments to bring life to those boys who had only
the presence of two men of God on the scene—the one a prophet,
the other the very Son of God himself.
I know it might beg the question a bit for you about why those two
boys were raised and Curtis wasn’t, or why your son or daughter or
other loved one wasn’t. And like so many other things in the life of
faith, I haven’t got an answer for you that will satisfy completely. I
wish I did. There are many questions I don’t know the answer to. But
it does seem that faith plays a role after all in all of this, but maybe
not in producing healing on demand or raising the dead when we
want to. Faith is normally the result of miracles like this rather than
miracles being the result of faith. 
4
When we get deeply involved with God in the suffering of others, we
are then in a position to see the dead raised to life in many ways.
Sometimes we ourselves are the dead who are raised.
In Yann Martel’s new novel, The High Mountains of Portugal, the
lead character, Tomas, has lost his only son and the boy’s mother to
a deadly virus. He feels as if he has died himself. In fact, from the
time of their death, he begins to do something strange: he walks
backward everywhere. He can’t face life forward because he feels
as if his life is in the past. Some of you may have felt this way.
In the midst of his grief, he finds the diary of a medieval missionary
priest, Father Ulisses. This man has been sent to a godforsaken
island where there is nothing but sugar cane fields worked by
African slaves. For a long while he sees them like a man of his time,
as something less than human. But in a moment of revelation by
observing their suffering up close, he sees them differently and
realizes his calling to serve them. This doesn’t go over well with the
church authorities, who think he is there to serve their masters. In
one passage he writes: I was summoned by the Bishop today. I told
him that I had met the unequal & in meeting them found them equal.
We are no better than they, I told him. In fact, we are worse. He
yelled at me that there are hierarchies of angels in heaven and of
the damned in hell, so there are hierarchies here on earth. The
boundaries are not to be blurred. I was sent off, struck by his
harshest thunderbolt, excommunication. In his eyes I am no longer a
man of the cloth. But I yet feel the Lord’s hand holding me up.1
The Lord’s hand holding me up. There it is. He was dead to the
church, but the dead were being raised by the hand of the Lord. And
only when he knew himself to be dead in that way did he truly come
to life. From that moment on his life was different. He had a
purpose. A mission.
Isn’t this what happens to us all when God gets a hold on us?
Though we were dead, yet shall we live. And those of us who live
and believe in Christ lose all fear of death because we know we
shall never truly die. The hand of Lord will always raise us up.  Jim Forbes is the pastor emeritus of The Riverside Church in New
York City. He delivered the Lyman Beecher lectures some years
ago at Yale on the Holy Spirit and preaching. Forbes grew up in the
Pentecostal tradition, which believes in the ministry of raising the
dead. But he became well educated and found himself wondering
whether he still could imagine his ministry like that. During a time
when he was a hospital chaplain, he was listening to a description of
clinical death. Phrases like “cessation of mental activity,” “no
apparent signs of life,” “no viable hope of continuing existence” were
tossed around. And then it occurred to him that he saw this every
Sunday when he looked out into the pews. He thought about how
the proclamation of the resurrected Christ brings new life to people
who were dead in their sins. He thought about how lives are
changed and how people are born again in faith. And he realized
that, yes, the dead still rise.
I’m here to tell you today that that is so. There’s a lot I don’t know,
don’t you know?! But I do know that. I have seen it. I have seen it
happen to you. It has happened to me many times, too, as God has
raised me up because you were there for me. Even lately. The dead
still rise.
And so I say to you today, in the name of the risen Christ, rise. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",6/5/2016,
"She never really had an easy life. Being a misunderstood, smart and
dominant girl of emerald-green skin did not help her situation at all. Through
most of her childhood, her father hid her from the public because he was
embarrassed of what she looked like.
It wasn’t until her first semester in college that she and many others around
finally figured out her identity as a witch and this, years later, would gain
her the once-in-a-lifetime chance to meet the Wizard of Oz.
However, Elphaba’s visit to the palace would not go the way she planned.
While the entire Land of Oz was in love with the Wizard, she realized that
he was not who she or Oz thought he was. What she came to know was that
the Wizard was not actually a wizard but a machine created by an ordinary
man who had no real magical power. In her effort to share with Oz who the
Wizard really was, she was shunned, cast out, and deemed the Wicked
Witch of the West.
She continued to be a misunderstood woman, but this time not just because
she was green and dominant, but because she was defying the gravitational
understanding and beliefs in all of Oz.
Yet, for the people of Oz, the Wizard cast out the fear that once seized their
minds. To the people of Oz, the Wizard’s plans were effectual and necessary
for their lives and livelihoods. It didn’t matter to Oz who the Wizard actually
was; he met their perceived needs. And nothing could or would damage their
belief in the Wizard and his power until he stopped meeting their needs.
The famed musical Wicked mainly focused on Elphaba going against the
‘powers that be’ and the fight between good and evil. Yet it is important to
notice the declaration by the citizens of Oz to be happy rather than righteous,
choosing to stand by the Wizard no matter the circumstance.
There is some truth in that we have all found ourselves believing in the
Wizard, haven’t we? Any wizard will do when you’re scared enough or
desperate enough. Even if they are not real or do not actually contribute to
our well-being. We believe in the things and people who promise to fulfill
our wants and desires. And that is not a problem that is new to us. The Israelites found themselves
in the midst of one of the worst droughts of their time–crops failing, animals
dying, their livelihood tested. Their needs were becoming great and their
resources were becoming scarce.
Ahab is known as the worst ruler according to the author of Kings. Jezebel
finds enjoyment in ending the lives of prophets who do not support her god.
These two held political power and continuously expressed to the Israelites
to reject the God of Israel because “he has hidden his face” and instead to
embrace Baal, the “rider of the clouds” and the “god of the storms and
weather.”
What is ironic about the Israelites turning their faith to Baal is that the
Ugaritic text, where we find most information about religions in ancient
Israel, indicates that during times of drought in the land, Baal was dead.
Even Baal’s press agents said he was of no use at the moment Israel wanted
to use him.
Yet, even in spite of all evidence, Israel still believed that Baal was the only
one who would meet their needs. Isn’t that the irony of all people across all
time? We put our faith into worldly idols that have no power to help us. And
we keep chasing after them long after it ought to have been clear that we are
on a fool’s errand.
The good news was there was a prophet in Israel. See, no matter how crazy
we get, God gives us a sane and healing word. Elijah stood on the top of
Mount Carmel watching and waiting. He was standing on Baal’s home turf,
the place where the pagans offered sacrifices and committed religious acts.
Here stood Elijah hearing the worshippers and prophets cry out to Baal,
hoping that he will answer or at least open his ears to their cry. Here stands
the troubler of Israel, creating trouble by putting the god, prophets, and the
believers within Israel to the test, but he stands knowing truth and the power
of the God of Israel.
This scenario not only foreshadows the continuous relationship of the
Israelites and God but also conveys an underlying theme that’s seen
throughout the entire Hebrew Bible and other literature–the relationship
between humanity and the Divine. It is easy to see when other people have gone crazy, isn’t it? Other people’s
problems are easy to solve. Your problems are so easy. My problems are
hard. What is hardest is seeing our own craziness while we’re doing it.
It is easy to ask: “Why can’t the Israelites go “steady” with God? They are
like a high school couple! What makes the Israelites continuously neglect
God and lack faith in God’s ability?”
It is easy to ask but harder to answer those same questions for ourselves.
Because aren’t we like the Israelites, too? How often do we find ourselves
wondering and asking the same questions for our lives? Asking questions of
our own faith: “Will I try to control my fate and my faith?” “Will I make
commandments for God or actually follow God’s commandments?”
Let’s just be honest. Whether Conservative, Moderate, or Liberal, we want a
god we can control and mold to our customs, to make sure the god is for us.
We cry out like Israel, “Give us a god like all the other nations have! Let us
worship like all the others!”
Just as the people of Oz needed to worship someone they believed was a
wizard, throughout time humanity has sought to worship gods who they
believed would work in their favor.
If God is not working for us or meeting our demands, we begin to question
not God’s existence, but God’s essence.
We want a god that serves us and solely meets our needs.
In the early 1930’s, Abraham Maslow moved his family to Wisconsin so that
he could begin study at the University of Wisconsin. While there, he became
interested in psychology and spent time working with Harry Harlow, who is
famous for his experiments with baby rhesus monkeys and attachment
behavior. One of the many interesting aspects that Maslow noticed of this
monkey business was the importance of needs and how some needs take
precedence over others. Maslow figured if this is the case for monkeys, then
surely it is the case for humans.
In 1954 Maslow published Motivation and Personality. In his effort to know
what motivates people, he came up with the theory known as “Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs.” He believed that people possess a set of motivation
systems unrelated to rewards or unconscious desires. He defined a need as
the lack of something or as something we desire. He figured out that within
all people is a drive that motivates them to satisfy their needs which then
becomes their essential goal.
Maslow states, “it is quite true that man lives by bread alone — when there
is no bread. But what happens to man’s desires when there is plenty of bread
and when his belly is chronically filled? At once another need [desire]
emerges.”
For many of us today, all our “needs” have become wholly, as if they
contained the whole of existence within them. We work and toil and spend
tireless efforts to gratify our “needs.” We worship not one but a whole
pantheon of needs and have come to view them as moral and spiritual norms
but they are nothing more than personal desires in disguise.
Humans are the subjects of needs.
Therefore, we look to our god(s) as the object, the supplier of our needs.
And if the god we worship does not supply our needs, we seek out a god
who will. Like the Israelites and the people of Oz, we too turn to worldly
idols without actual power, authority, or the ability to bless. We turn our
focus on self and our own ability to satisfy our desires. We become tempted
to give our loyalty, commitment and worship to pagan gods, alongside the
God of Israel, as if we can get through our lives limping with two different
opinions.
The problem with this arrangement is who we worship is not based on our
devotion, but what they will do to make us happy.
This is great if the heart of Christianity is all about God working for us.
What I instruct God to do, God does. Our American society is built on what
I can obtain (You built that!), what I can get out of life. And our culture has
made its way into our Christian lifestyle and even into our worship. The
question for us has become “What will I get from God?” rather than “What
will God get out of me?” Hear me when I say our God is not appeased by our self-image/self-worth,
our loud voices and demands, our desires. God’s action is not about meeting
our desires but revealing himself in the world through us.
At the heart of our relationship with God is knowing we are not the subject
of needs and desires, but we are the object of God’s revelation and even
God’s concern. We are workers in God’s field and agents of his mission, not
the other way around.
We relate to God when we realize greatness is not within our ability to
please our ego or satisfy our needs; greatness comes when we stand above
these needs. We identify with God when we sacrifice self for the sake of
being holy.
And would you rather be happy or holy? Sometimes holiness leads to
happiness and sometimes it doesn’t. But for every circumstance, choosing to
be holy is always the right answer.
In the finale of Wicked’s first act, Elphaba and Galinda sing the awardwinning
song Defying Gravity. Galinda tries her hardest to dissuade Elphaba
of fighting the wizard and his evil plans. But in the midst of the going back
and forth, Elphaba invites Galinda to join with her. She tells her the work
they could do together would be unlimited if they worked in tandem. The
work would not just change their lives but all the lives in Oz. It was an
invitation to join forces together for the benefit of what is good, for what is
right, and do I dare say, for what is holy.
In the same way Elijah offers a plea to God to reveal himself, and also an
invitation to Israel to reject Baal and turn “their hearts back to God” so they
may work in tandem. It is an invitation to stop limping and start living.
And the same invitation has been extended to us.
I know it is hard to hear the voices that tell us our worldly gods are not God.
We can demonize them. We can ignore them. But Elphaba and Elijah are
trying to help us. And the one true and living God is calling to us. Amen.",Timothy Peoples,"Dallas, TX",5/29/2016,
"I didn’t intend to preach a series on the Holy Spirit. Really. But
that’s the Holy Spirit for you—full of surprises and sometimes
delight in just seeing where we’re being led.
Two Sundays ago I preached on the Ascension and noted Jesus’
words about how when he went up into heaven the disciples were
to stay in Jerusalem until they received power from on high. That
staying power had to do with Jesus’ continuing presence in their
lives through the gift of the Holy Spirit that would come just ten
days later at Pentecost. Last Sunday we attended to the gift of the
Holy Spirit at Pentecost that enabled the disciples miraculously to
proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ to people from all over the
Mediterranean region in their own languages. Staying Power had
become Saying Power. Communication led to community, and the
church was born.
My son remarked over Sunday lunch about these two sermons on
staying power and saying power. So Dad, what’s next week,
‘Slaying Power’?
Now, we preachers can get clever by half now and then, but it did
get me thinking about this Sunday, which is called Trinity Sunday,
because we think about how the gift of the Holy Spirit rounds out
our understanding of the God who was and is and always will be
triune. God is three persons—Father, Son and Holy Spirit—yet
one God. God is God alone, but God is not a lone God. God is
personal and relational at the core of God’s being.
So, what about it, George? Slaying power? My first response was
to think about how the Pentecostal movement uses the phrase
“slain in the Spirit” to describe how some people experience the
Holy Spirit’s power to possess them and heal them. People fall flat
on the ground as if they’re dead—slain by the Spirit that takes all
the life out of the person in order to put new life back into the
person. Now that would be a way to go with this, but while I 
2
believe in the Holy Spirit, I don’t see that metaphor of slaying
being the usual way God works.
The other reference to slaying power struck me as cultural.
Beyoncé’s song Formation, which she debuted at halftime of the
Super Bowl, has her repeating again and again the phrase, I slay.
Now, I’ve watched and listened to the song, and I’ve read black
women see it as an anthem of empowerment. The idea is that
black women need to stop depending upon black men—or anyone
else for that matter—since their black lives matter regardless of
other people. They matter period. But when she says I slay, she
means she succeeds because of her own hard work that pays off.
I’m okay with that, but at the end of her song she says that the best
revenge is the paper—meaning money.
For all the good empowerment language of personal
responsibility, this can lead to another distortion of the Holy
Spirit: the idea that God provides us slaying power, which in
essence is winning power measured as material prosperity.
Despite the extra need in the black community for empowerment
overall, the prosperity gospel is not more acceptable for black folk
than white folk. Neither Beyoncé nor Joel Osteen is what I’m
saying. The Holy Spirit is not God’s gift of personal power for
worldly success.
Looking closer at what Jesus said—and that’s always the right
thing to do, don’t you know?!—we might think of the Holy Spirit
as Swaying Power rather than Slaying Power. And we can see this
in several ways in our text.
First, Jesus is the one who gives us the Spirit. The Spirit Jesus
gives works within us to keep us aware of Jesus’ continuing
presence in the world. His resurrection means he is not a dead
figure to remember with reverence and fondness. He has been
raised from the dead and lives at the right hand of God. His work
is not finished in the world. But now it will be accomplished
through the swaying power of the Holy Spirit.
Jesus says that the Holy Spirit will not speak independently from 
3
Jesus or the Father. The Spirit is privy to their eternal
conversation. The Spirit will only share what God wants revealed
to us. And that will always involve glorifying Jesus as God the Son,
just as Jesus always glorifies God the Father.
The most important work, then, of the Holy Spirit is to sway us
into believing in Jesus. No one is slain into believing in Jesus as if
we have no part in it but to play dead. Yes, the Spirit gives us the
power to believe, but we still have to believe. We are empowered
to believe, enabled. But we don’t do it on our own. We don’t slay,
so to speak. Belief is not an achievement. It is a response to the
wooing, prompting, swaying power of the Holy Spirit.
I don’t know how many people you have ever successfully argued
into faith in Jesus Christ. My record isn’t good. No matter how
compelling the evidence is for him being the Messiah, no matter
how well the evidence is presented, there is always enough doubt
in human terms that people will have a plausible case for unbelief.
We can respect that. When Peter declared that Jesus was the
Christ, the Son of the Living God, Jesus said to him, Flesh and blood
has not revealed that to you, but my Father in heaven. In other
words, the Father reveals the Son through the swaying power of
the Spirit. That was true for Peter and it is true for any of us and
all of who come to believe in Jesus. The question is whether we
are willing to be swayed. Let me put that more pointedly if you are
struggling with faith today: Are you willing to be swayed?
The second thing is this: The Spirit continues to lead us into all
truth. Jesus tells us there is more truth to come that he could not
share with the disciples in his time. His Spirit, however, will be
with them and will lead them into all truth in times to come. Jesus
will still be at work through the Spirit to lead the church.
Our church’s mission statement says as much: The Wilshire
mission is to build a community of faith shaped by the Spirit of Jesus
Christ. We believe the Holy Spirit will lead us and guide us as we
consider the ways of Christ for our time. And that’s why our vision
statement says that we will be a bold witness to the way of Christ in
our time. Every church must rely on the work of the Holy Spirit 
4
among us, not on our own understanding. Every church must be
willing to think and study and pray for the leadership of the Spirit
in finding our way in our time.
When the Pilgrims sailed for the new world in 1620, their
minister, John Robinson, gave them a final charge. Here’s a
portion of what he said: I charge you before God … that you follow
me no further than you have seen me follow the Lord Jesus Christ. If
God reveals anything to you by any other instrument of His, be as
ready to receive it as you were to receive any truth by my ministry,
for I am verily persuaded the Lord hath more truth yet to break
forth out of His Holy Word. For my part, I cannot sufficiently bewail
the condition of those reformed churches which … will go, at
present, no further than the instruments of their reformation. The
Lutherans cannot be drawn to go beyond what Luther saw;
whatever part of His will our God had revealed to Calvin, they will
rather die than embrace it; and the Calvinists, you see, stick fast
where they were left by that great man of God, who yet saw not all
things. This is a misery much to be lamented, for though they were
precious shining lights in their times, yet God had not revealed his
whole will to them; and were they now living … they would be as
ready and willing to embrace further light, as that they had
received.1
This is a remarkable word, and I’ll try to remember to tell you the
same thing someday when the pulpit is passed. I can only imagine
The Reverend Robinson was thinking about our text from John 16
and our Lord’s words about how the Spirit will lead us into all
truth, truth that couldn’t yet be known in that time. There is virtue
in honoring those who have gone before us and listening to their
witness even from the grave. But there is virtue, too, in standing
on their shoulders and listening to the Spirit in our time even as
they did in theirs. This is no easy work, but the Lord has promised
to be with us in it, guiding us into all truth by the Spirit’s swaying
power. But there is one more nuance to this that I am loathe to admit. The
Spirit will lead us into all truth in our time, but our time is not
necessarily my time or your time; it is our time together. And our
time may or may not be right now even if you or I want or don’t
want that to be the case. We have to discern the truth the Spirit is
leading us to, and we also have to discern the time as well. Some
of us are always in a hurry for the new, and others of us are
always content with the old. Some are ever ready to move and
others just insist on being unmoved. It turns out none of us is
given a perfect sense of timing on behalf of everyone else. Which
can only mean we need to honor each other in that tension.
When the Pilgrims left Leiden for England, some of them stayed
behind, including their pastor. (Which may be the first time in
history a Protestant pastor has led from behind.) The others
sailed first for England on a ship called the Speedwell to meet the
Mayflower in Southampton, where they would sail on together to
America. On the way to Southampton, the Speedwell was leaking,
so they had to spend a week patching her up. When they finally
sailed, she started taking on water again and they returned to
Dartmouth for repairs. Then they sailed 300 miles out to sea and
she started leaking again, so they returned to Plymouth. Some of
the Pilgrims were so discouraged that they couldn’t get there
quicker, they gave up altogether. The rest boarded an overloaded
Mayflower and headed out again.
The first half of the 66-day voyage was smooth, but then they hit
Atlantic storms that threatened to undo them. Five passengers
died on the journey. Sometimes the weather was so bad, they had
to drift in the wind and waves because they couldn’t use the sails.
They had to be patient and just wait out the storms. They finally
were able to regroup and head for Northern Virginia, but even
then they found their destination wasn’t exactly what they had
planned. They landed instead on Cape Cod and called it Plymouth,
in honor of the place from which they launched.
The journey of faith is never easy. It is fraught with danger on all
sides. And like those first disciples who feared the future without
their Lord, we are prone to worry our way forward. But we have 
6
been given the gift of Christ’s presence through the Holy Spirit
who will never mislead us. Things may not turn out like we plan
or when we plan, but it’s the Spirit’s swaying power we depend
upon to lead us in our time.
The challenge before us is always the same: to listen carefully and
to journey faithfully, together. Amen. 
",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",5/22/2016,
"What we’ve got here is failure to communicate. That’s one of the
most memorable lines in all of the film. In Cool Hand Luke,
Strother Martin plays the prison warden that Paul Newman’s
character calls the captain. Luke hates being in prison and is
always trying to escape. After one such failed attempt, the captain
says: You gonna get used to wearing them chains after a while,
Luke. Don’t you never stop listening to them clinking, ’cause they
gonna remind you what I been saying for your own good. Luke
replies: I wish you’d stop being so good to me, Cap’n.
The Cap’n doesn’t take to that sass. He applies a good beating to
Luke and then addresses the other men, saying: What we’ve got
here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can’t reach.
Something extraordinary happened on Pentecost Sunday in
Jerusalem just a short while after Jesus went up into heaven. What
happened is that heaven came down. The Spirit of God descended
in a new way and reached men who otherwise couldn’t have been
reached. The gift of the Spirit at Pentecost was a miracle of
communication and community both, and it continues to this day.
Last Sunday was Ascension Sunday in the church. As we
remember, it’s the day we remember that Jesus was going from
this visible earthly realm to the right hand of God in the invisible
heavenly realm. He promised, though, that if he were going from
them, he would come again to them. The down payment on his
promise was the Holy Spirit, who would be his powerful presence
in the world, his special agent of love and grace that would give
them staying power.
Jesus would be with us always in order that we would always
have the power to persevere in anything we stand for that Jesus
stands for. So when we stand with and for those who can’t stand
for themselves or who would otherwise only stand alone, we will
always have staying power. But when we stand for ourselves 
2
against those who can’t stand for themselves, we are left only to
ourselves; we can’t count on Jesus’ staying power. The church that
lives for itself will die, but the church that lives for others will
always live.
But staying power is only one gift of the Spirit. Pentecost shows us
that we also receive saying power. That is to say, we receive the
power to overcome all barriers that keep people from knowing
one another deeply and being together fully. So there it is again,
don’t you know?! The link between communication and
community is the Holy Spirit.
Luke tells us that when the day of Pentecost came, Jews were
gathered in Jerusalem for the Festival of Weeks. That is the second
of the three great feasts of Judaism that are tied to harvests. The
first is the Feast of the First Fruits, which is connected to the
Passover. The second is Shavuot, which is the Feast of Weeks—
the word Shavuot means “weeks”—and it occurs exactly 50 days
after Passover. The word Pentecost means “fifty.” And the third is
the Feast of Tabernacles. Although these feasts are connected to
the agricultural cycle for the purpose of making sacrifices at the
Temple, they are more deeply tied to the story of Israel itself.
Passover celebrates the
deliverance of the children of Israel from slavery in Egypt.
Pentecost commemorates the giving of the Law—the Ten
Commandments—on Mt. Sinai. So here we are at Pentecost, and
Jews have gathered from all over the Mediterranean region in
Jerusalem to make their grain offerings and renew their faith.
Because they are all from different places, they speak different
languages, and they don’t fully understand each other. They go to
the Temple to make their offerings, but they don’t know each
other as one people because they can’t communicate in one
language.
Then all of a sudden, the Spirit shows up as a mighty rushing
wind. Tongues of fire appear over the heads of the disciples as
they begin to speak. And these disciples, who speak only Aramaic
with a Galilean accent and never even took Spanish in high school,
all at once start speaking in different languages so that everyone 
3
can understand the good news of Jesus Christ for the first time. All
at once all of them feel that they belong, no matter who they are
or where they came from. The God who gave the Law of Moses on
tablets of stone now has given the Law of Love to tender hearts.
They hear a new love language that draws them together.
This is what happens when the Spirit gives the church saying
power. When we speak the gospel of Jesus Christ to people in their
love language, that is, in the language of their hearts that most
moves them, something powerful happens between us.
Some of you are familiar with the five love languages of
relationships. Gary Chapman is a Christian psychologist who came
up with this notion of how we are all wired toward receiving
affection from others in one of five ways. Some feel loved when
we receive gifts, some with quality time, some with words of
affirmation, some with acts of service or devotion, and some with
physical touch. If you want to have a close relationship, you can’t
simply love someone on your own terms and expect them to
adopt your language. You have to learn to love them in their own
language.1
This is the spirit that spawned the movement in Christian
missions to translate the Bible into every native tongue. Whereas
some religions believe that people need to learn the original
language of those who first came to believe and thus wrote their
holy books in that language in order to create a single culture,
Christians have always believed that the gospel of Jesus Christ is
transcultural. God is not worried about the diversity of our
cultures keeping us apart; God celebrates our differences as if
they’re a source of enrichment for us all and a sign of the new
creation that God is bringing to pass.
Debie Thomas was born in India but raised in the United States.
Her parents insisted that the children speak English in public but
their native tongue at home. That bilingual experience served to
keep Debie linked to her place of birth, but it also made her feel somewhat out of place in the U.S.
Then one day an American girl named Sarah came to visit. She
was blond-haired and blue-eyed, in her early thirties. Her aunt
and uncle had called the family together, and about thirty of them
gathered in a living room. Her uncle turned things over to Sarah,
who spoke to them, saying: Namaskaram, ningalay ellavarayum
kandathil ennicku santhosham ondu. (“Hello, I’m so happy to meet
all of you.”) She spoke to them in Malayaham, a language spoken
by 38 million people who live in South India. Seems Sarah and her
parents, who were journalists, had lived in Delhi for some years,
and the family frequently vacationed in Kerala, where Debie’s
family was from. Sarah was so taken by the culture that she
moved back to South India after college and worked to learn the
language. It was hard work, she admitted, and sometimes
embarrassing, making mistakes and having to learn all sorts of
new ways of forming her mouth to bring about new sounds. But it
was all worth it. She learned that that were new insights to be
gained. She discovered new ways of understanding God and the
world that were unsayable in her own language.
When Sarah left, Debie said that something had happened to her.
Something became possible for the first time—an alliance, a
bridging, a new kind of empathy and friendship. When my family
experienced the unprecedented pleasure of hearing “an American”
speak our language, we realized that the many distances separating
“us” from “them” were not, in fact, un-crossable. Sarah—the
stranger—had taken a risk, made herself vulnerable, and entered
our world. In doing so, she had rendered us less strange. Less
alien. Less Other.2
Think about this: God is the most Other being to all of us, even
though we are created in God’s image. When God became human
and lived among us in Jesus Christ, God learned our love language
and communicated in terms we could understand. We were no
longer alienated from God. God crossed the divide between us. We
found out that we were loved and accepted by the one who is over us all and beyond us all because that God came to be with us all.
In the last couple of years, Wilshire has been part of the New
Baptist Covenant movement, working in partnership with
Friendship West Baptist Church in South Dallas on publicadvocacy
issues like payday lending reform. The heart of our
work, though, is racial reconciliation. We have gotten to know one
another better—white Baptist Christians in North Dallas and
black Baptist Christians in South Dallas. And what we have
worked on is not trying to get them to speak our language but
learning to speak theirs. And they have worked to do the same
with us. We both speak English, of course, but we all have a
language of the heart that comes from our different cultural
experiences.
By listening and learning about each other, we have begun to
break through the sense of being alien or other to each other. The
more we do this, the more we find ourselves seeing each other as
sisters and brothers in Christ. We are not trying to be colorblind,
which is a strategy that ultimately tries to make the other into
ourselves. We see black and white, but now as beautiful
expressions of our diverse family of faith. Nothing the federal
government or the courts decree can do compares to what the
Holy Spirit can do in bringing us together.
One mark of a church that is being shaped by the Spirit of Jesus
Christ is that it learns to communicate with people of different
experiences in a way that brings us together as one people. And
every church has to decide whether it wants to look more like an
affinity group or more like the kingdom of God.
Suzii Paynter is the executive coordinator of the Cooperative
Baptist Fellowship. She loves to say that we can be alone, or we
can be a Fellowship. I know this, she says, I alone cannot be your
church. And you alone cannot be mine. We are already membered
through time in a timeless love. … This is our Fellowship, and we can
be woven together. Can I hear an amen?
The gift of the Holy Spirit gives us saying power, and that saying 
6
power communicates heart to heart and soul to soul. But as it
does so, it does something else: communication becomes
community. We become a community, a community of faith. We
are no longer Other to each other. We are each other.
Failure to communicate keeps us apart. Successful communication
makes us a part.
It seems that the world is divided in every way today—our
neighborhoods, our schools, our politics, our religions, our races,
our nationalities, our sexual orientations and gender identities.
You name it, we are divided by languages that threaten always to
separate us. But look what happened at Pentecost: the end result
of the Holy Spirit being among us is that everyone who calls on the
name of the Lord shall be saved. Everyone. Every last one.
That, my friends, is what church is for. Are you in? ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",5/15/2016,
"If you’re inclined toward romance—and I hope you are— you can find
no better musical friend than that smooth soul crooner, Barry White. In
one of his signature songs, he sings:
I’m not goin' nowhere
I'm stayin’, baby. I’m stayin’
You know why?
I’ve got staying power.
Just when you think it’s over
I’ll come right back again.
I’ve got staying power.
Just when we thought it was over, Jesus came right back. He had
staying power. Staying power allowed him to cast out demons when no
one else would confront them at all. Staying power sent him from his
home state of Galilee to a hotbed of conflict in Jerusalem. Staying
power gave him the courage to speak the truth to power in the Temple
and to the Roman authorities. Staying power bore him up under the
lashes of the whip and nails on the cross and gave him the grace to
forgive his enemies while on that cross. Jesus stayed strong through it
all because he had the power from on high that filled his heart with
love in the face of hate, with peace in the face of violence, and with
strength in the face of pain.
Jesus had staying power all the way to the grave. But after God raised
him from the dead, he wasn’t staying. He was going to his Father in
heaven. He was leaving. Sort of.
At the end of the Gospel of Luke, Jesus tells his disciples: These are my
words that I spoke to you while I was still with you. … “Wait a minute,
Jesus; you’re still here,” they must have thought as he spoke to them
from Jerusalem. “Why can’t you stay with us now? As long as you are
with us, we’ll be okay. Why are you leaving us now?”
Today is Ascension Sunday in the church, a day on which we celebrate
Jesus leaving this earthly plane and going to to be with God. The 
2
disciples didn’t know where he was going, but by ascending to his
Father in heaven, he was doing something important for the work of
God and for the disciples. As long as he was with them, he himself
possessed the staying power of the Spirit. But by leaving them visibly
and going to be with God in the invisible realm, he was making room
for the same staying power of the Holy Spirit to be with them.
Wherever Jesus is, there is the Holy Spirit. But by his leaving them,
what was local could become global. What was his could become
theirs, too. The church would need the same power of the Holy Spirit
that Jesus possessed in his mission in order to fulfill its mission to take
the good news of God’s redemptive love to all peoples.
Jesus knew that if the church were to continue his work on earth, we
would need the same staying power he had for his mission. We can’t do
what he commissions us to do on our own. On our own we fold under
pressure. We give in to fear. We act to save ourselves instead of giving
ourselves for the sake of the world.
During the Great Depression, there was a run on the banks. People
were lined up for blocks trying to take their money out of the banks
because there was no Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to
guarantee the safety of their money. When President Franklin
Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, he spoke plainly to the
people by reminding them that the only thing they had to fear was fear
itself. Things got worse. So on March 6, he closed the banks for a full
week so that the people would have time to think about what they
were doing. He gave a radio message called a Fireside Chat, and he
urged hoarders to put their money back in the banks for the sake of the
nation. That week of waiting gave people time to renew their spirit.
And when the banks reopened, the lines were nearly as long, as people
returned their cash to the banks. The stock market had the largest
single-day gain in history.
Staying power first requires the obedience of patience that allows us to
gather ourselves for a bigger purpose than ourselves. That’s why Jesus
told the disciples to go into Jerusalem and stay there.
The word stay means “sit still.” Anyone have trouble with that? I mean,
when you are anxious and worried, sitting still and waiting on God is
one of the hardest things to do. 
3
But that’s what the evangelist Charles Finney preached during the
Second Great Awakening in America in the early nineteenth century.
Finney preached to people who were experiencing enormous social
chaos on the frontier of western New York in an area that came to be
known as the “burnt over district.” Things were changing so fast that
people felt they couldn’t cope. Finney knew that any great social
change for the better would have to come from spiritually changed
people. He conducted revivals in which people came and waited on the
Lord. Like the early disciples who went into Jerusalem and prayed and
praised God in the Temple while they waited, these people came to
tent meetings and sang and heard the gospel preached. They felt the
Holy Spirit come upon them in a new and powerful way. And then the
effect on them was more than personal. They went from there to create
powerful reforms that cleaned up society. Educational reforms and
prison reforms came from this movement. The temperance movement,
the women’s movement, and the abolitionist movement all have roots
in this transformational time of waiting on the staying power of the
Holy Spirit.
So there’s the kind of staying power that starts out with waiting in
order to receive power from on high. But then there’s a kind of staying
power that stands up to worldly power in order to do good. Staying
power begins by sitting still and ends by standing up.
Physicists talk about two kinds of energy: potential energy and kinetic
energy. Potential energy is stored energy. It is stationary, so to speak.
It’s like the water at the top of a waterfall. It’s like an iPhone being
charged overnight before using it. Kinetic energy is energy in motion.
It’s the water going over the falls. It’s the phone accessing data.
On this Mother’s Day, think of staying power as the waiting period of
pregnancy that yields at last to the staying power of the birthing
process. First there is the storing up and nurturing of life in the womb;
then there is the movement from the womb that gives new life to the
world.
Potential energy in the church is the stored energy of the Holy Spirit
that we receive by waiting upon God. But that waiting isn’t all passive;
it involves putting ourselves in the obedient position of prayer and
praise that allows God to fill us for what is to come. When we come to
worship or Bible study, we are storing the energy of the Spirit. We 
4
come and stay in order to receive power. When we leave this place and
go into the world, we then have power to live out our mission the way
Jesus did.
It’s worth remembering that going back into Jerusalem was dangerous
for the disciples. That’s where Jesus was killed. That’s where they
feared that they too would be tracked down and killed by those same
authorities. But staying power means going obediently into the fray
and waiting on God for power.
Coming to church is not running away; it’s running to. Here we
confront our fears with faith. Here we remember Jesus’ promise to be
with us wherever we go. Here we prepare ourselves for our mission.
But we don’t stay here. Faith is a verb more than a noun. It is only
passive in order for it to become active. It’s a gift we have to spend.
Courage is seen only in the face of threat. And so we have to put our
hearts into challenging the powers of death that threaten God’s
children and rob them of the life God intends.
You have already heard from Jolly Okot today. If her story doesn’t
move you, you should find a cardiologist immediately, don’t you
know?! Jolly’s faith and work are beautiful examples to us of staying
power. She could have done what most people would be inclined to do
when she escaped from Joseph Kony and his murderous thugs in
Africa: she could have stayed away instead of staying in. She could
have protected herself. But instead she went back into the fray, seeking
to rescue and protect women and children from his terror.
Most of the time, this is how we find our mission in life. We pay
attention to our own experience. We determine to be good stewards of
what had happened to us so that it will save or help someone else who
is going through similar ordeals. We become witnesses in this way.
When Jesus had explained to his disciples the meaning of all that had
happened to him, he said that they were witnesses to these things. And
he meant not only that they had been eyewitnesses to them as they
happened, but also that they should become witnesses to these things
from that day forward. They should tell others what they had seen and
experienced. They should bear witness to how the suffering of the
Messiah had opened the tomb and thus opened the world to a new way 
5
of living. Now repentance and forgiveness would be the marks of the
life that is possible through the Risen One.
But it will require staying power to stay in there when times get tough.
The powers that act to rob people of their freedom and dignity at every
turn are not going to go away when you show up the first time and ask
them nicely to stop stomping on God’s children. The word for witness
in the text is martyres, which gives us the English word martyr. A
witness doesn’t back down, even if it is personally costly. A witness
does the right thing and says the right thing in order to bring about the
right outcome.
As we think about mothering today, I am always mindful of the shadow
side of any celebration. We don’t want to take anything away from
mothers today, but we should also remember those who wish to be
mothers but aren’t, those who have lost a child to a miscarriage or an
abortion or a stillbirth, those whose children have been taken from
them by thieves or traffickers or by bitter spouses after a divorce, and
those whose children have been abused in horrendous ways by a
parent or other relative. Those who have known this suffering and loss
are witnesses who can speak and act for good. They often make
wonderful foster parents or adoptive parents of children cast aside, or
advocates for a more- humane system of caring for and protecting kids.
Usually, like Jolly’s story, the best way to find your mission in life is to
go into your own pain and let it lead you to relieve the pain of someone
else. Become a witness. Stand up for someone who needs an advocate.
Don’t waste your pain on yourself. Use it to relieve the pain of others.
The good news is that the same staying power that sustained Jesus is
available to you and me even now. You can stay with it, because when
you stand up for those who are weak and vulnerable, those who are
shut in or shut out, you will have Holy Spirit staying power. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",5/8/2016,
"“Sometimes I feel like a motherless child, a long way from home.” This
Negro spiritual has been sung for centuries and like most spirituals, the song
tells a story that’s much deeper than the few words we sing. This spiritual is
an illustrative story that is unique to the individual who is singing.
See, on the one hand it could represent the feeling of isolation the slaves felt
as they were stolen from their motherland of Africa. Because slaves were
forced to leave their families, they formed new communities from a variety of
African tribes. As a result, they formed a new people, a new culture and they
often needed to figure out how to survive in a world that didn’t see them as
human.
On the other hand, it refers to the devastation that children born into slavery
felt as they were torn away from their parents and sold to another master.
Most times when the child was sold, their parents would give them a tangible
item to remember them by.
This spiritual is not just a tune meant to entertain or pass the time; it’s the
story of a child who has been separated from those who have protected him to
the best of their abilities and those who have provided for him with the little
they have. It is a sigh from the heart, an exhaling of the soul giving expression
to the deepest grief. “Sometimes I feel like a motherless child.” Yet, even in
the darkest hour the clause suggests that sometimes I don’t! Sometimes, I feel
strong, sometimes I feel there is hope, no longer lost, ready to go on.”
Sometimes. Sometimes.
In our passage, as Jesus announces his departure, it seems that the disciples
are working through these “some-timey” feelings. Wouldn’t you if you got
the news that Jesus was leaving?
A host of emotions must have flooded the hearts of the disciples; questions
must have quickly rushed to their minds “How could he be leaving so soon?”
“What am I to do now?” “You instructed me to leave my family, friends,
belongings and because of my decision to follow you, I am an outsider to the
mainstream world. I can’t easily slip back into society.” “I know you have told us story after story and said a few fragments, but Lord we need you to tell
us what we are going to do because right now I feel like I am being torn apart
from my parent.
We must recognize that the circumstance the disciples were in was much
different than slaves in the Antebellum South. But, if you think about it, the
disciples were a group of people from different backgrounds. They, in many
ways, became a part of a counterculture, beginning a new culture, and created
a new family with those who were once strangers. They, too, had to figure out
how to navigate in a space that didn't want them. And in the midst of finally
figuring out how to do that, they find out their protector, provider, professor
Jesus is leaving.
In their weary state, Jesus looks at his babies and says, “I won’t leave you
orphaned, but here is what I leave you to remember me by.”
Jesus moves the disciples beyond this present moment in which they are
living, into the future that is grounded in the confidence of the resurrection
and in the gift of the spirit. The same spirit the creator breathed into them.
The same spirit that hovers over the chaos of the seas and imparts wisdom to
all humankind. This Advocate will clarify all that remains hidden. With this
spirit, a vision of a future shaped by the promises of God is offered.
Jesus is speaking to them at a spiritual level, but the disciples are grieving.
They don’t understand all of that; they never have.
I imagine Jesus in the midst of his farewell speech, realizing this as he looked
out over the disciples, seeing their heads hung low and tears in their eyes.
This is where he changes the conversation.
Jesus reaches deep inside himself and shares one of the most important
aspects within his life. He shares the virtue that equipped him to withstand the
powers of Rome and helped him decide to take up his cross and die, the virtue
that allowed him to deal with his own grief. He leaves Peace.
“Jesus, we have the Pharisees criticizing everything we do. People are out to
get you! ISIS is on a rampage, there are mass shootings happening almost
weekly, the economy continues to fluctuate, inequality continues to flourish, brutality bombards the land, there are continuous political fights over things
that don’t matter, the church is in conflict, families are going to bed without
food and shelter and you’re talking about peace. This ain’t the Miss America
Pageant.”
If this is what you’re leaving us, Jesus, how can you say you will not leave us
orphaned?
But let’s be honest, what makes the promise of peace difficult for us to
fathom is that peace is what we feel like we are missing right now. In a world
of conflict and hate, we ask the question, “Where is this so-called peace that
you are leaving us?”
For many of us, peace is understood to mean the ceasing of conflict, end of
turmoil, and even the termination of worry. The first definition in the
dictionary validates this view: “peace is the freedom from disturbance.”
For the disciples, peace came at a time in Roman history known as the Pax
Romana, which lasted for 200 years. Essentially, it meant that the Roman
Empire had so much power over individuals that fear of the state was enough
to make citizens do good rather than wrong. Slogans such as “My legion lives
in your home, the sword at your throat, and my sandal on your chest” gave the
imagery of what the empire was capable of doing and the amount of power it
had over its citizens.
Yet, neither the cessation of conflict nor the power of the empire equates to
the peace that Jesus is describing in this passage. What Jesus leaves does not
only challenge our definition of peace, but also challenges our faith.
This is the first time that the word peace, ??????? (eir?n?n), is used in the
Gospel. By its very definition it means “the tranquil state of a soul when
assured of its salvation.” It is an individualized state, not one that is secured
by an empire or the world, but secured by our faith in God and even the
promises of God’s future. Peace is not simply the absence of something but
the very presence of something. Not a peace that abolishes the conflict, the
hate, and the struggles within the world, but the peace that Jesus gives is
nothing less than the consequence of the presence of God. Charlotte, a mother of two, would often go into her children’s room and pray
for them as they were sleeping. Her children would constantly wonder why in
the world does Mom stop in at 3 am some nights mumbling words as tears fell
from her eyes. After years and years of doing this, the son decided before he
left for college he would ask his mother, “What was the point of all those
prayers in the middle of the night?”
The day finally came for him to leave. The car was loaded, there was food
and drinks for the road trip, everything was ready to go and as he stepped into
the car, he remembered the question for his mother. So he unbuckled his seat
belt and ran back into the house and said, “Mom, what was the point of all
those midnight prayers?”
With tears in her eyes, she looked at her baby who was about to take a long
journey away from home and said, “You’re a black child in a white world.
There will be times that the world will only see your difference. Some in the
world will be demeaning toward you; some will hate, degrade, and humiliate
you, all because of what they see as a difference. And the sad part is Momma
won’t always be there with you, be there to protect or guide you. So those late
night prayers were prayers for what may seem like the darkest moments in
your life, that the peace of God would reign in your heart. Prayers that the
presence of God would be there to protect and guide. When the hate of the
world only sees your difference, may peace remind you of your value and
your purpose.”
I never told my mother of all the issues and problems that I dealt with while
living in a small town, but in some ways I think she already knew and also
knew that in going to college a long way from home, there would be many
more issues.
This is what we have to understand. We are far from our home and we are
resident aliens to this world. Therefore, the world will notice who we are,
what we base our identity in, and hopefully how we love and this in itself will
create divergence. The world realizes that material security, conformity,
indifference, and denial of conflict and suffering do not offer peace, and will
probably condemn our ways. This is because our basic society sees difference
to create conflict. If you thought Jesus’ peace was all calming and comforting, you thought
wrong.
Yet, the backside to the peace Jesus offers moves us out of the false illusions
of the world and even out of ourselves. Though peace is not the abolishment
of conflict, this peace pushes us to work in finding resolutions to the conflict.
It secures our value, maintains our calling, and precedes our purpose and
mission. “It helps us believe that life has meaning somehow, that I am useful
here sometimes, and that I make small differences somewhere.""
When we are open to the peace that Christ passes, we leave open the
possibility for God to work. The trusting that his redeeming is a present and
future event and not something that has been finished in the past, will change
our lives and all the lives around us.
This past week, Erica, Matthew, Geri McKenzie and I went to an Enneagram
workshop. It is a personality assessment that helps you better understand
yourself and also how to act and react toward other people. Well,
continuously throughout the workshop, Susan, the workshop leader would
say, “One thing we cannot change about ourselves is how we see. But we can
change what we do with what we see.”
And as I look around, I see a body of people, like the disciples, who have
come from far and wide to follow Jesus. I see a body of people who are
grieving over loss, troubled over the state of the world. I see people who are
anxious and unsettled about disagreement in the church. I see people who are
distressed over wounded friendships and hurt by family members. I see a
body of people who are broken and vulnerable. I see people who, like the
disciples, only focus on the point that Jesus is leaving, ignoring what he has
left us. I see people focused on the aspect that sometimes I feel as if he doesn't
walk or talk with me or even that I am his. I see people that may sometimes
feel like motherless children.
Like the tangible gifts that were given to the slave child to remember their
parents, Jesus gives us peace for those exact moments. While I realize that
peace is not tangible, it works through tangible people. It works through us so our needs, wants, shame, brokenness and vulnerability
won’t define us. It works through us so that in the midst of adversity and
hardship we can still prevail in love. It works through us so that we can be his
disciples and most of all, the church.
Here is what I decided to change and do with what I see. Like Jesus, I pass
peace. So, may the Peace of the Lord always be with you. Amen. ",Timothy Peoples,"Dallas, TX",5/1/2016,
"I give you a NEW commandment, that you love one another.
That’s the line that jumps out of our text today. But did you stop to
think about what Jesus said there? I hope you are biblically
literate enough to have said to yourself, Wait a minute, what’s
NEW about that?
I mean, isn’t the commandment to love one another as old as the
Old Testament? Didn’t Jesus himself quote Moses when he
brought together the two great commandments into one; that is,
love God with all your heart, soul, strength and mind, and love
your neighbor as yourself? Okay, so I know that was something
Jesus said only in the synoptic Gospels, not in John. Is this just
John making another one of his uncomfortable statements that
seem to distance Christianity from Judaism?
No, I am always reminding you that Jesus never converted to
Christianity, as strange as that sounds to us now. He was always a
Jew, as were all his closest disciples. It is true that by the time the
Gospel of John was written, Jewish believers in Jesus been thrown
out of the synagogues and were forced to organize themselves
into the church, since their spiritual kinfolk had pushed them out.
So if at times it sounds as if John has a chip on his shoulder about
“the Jews,” be careful not to read too much into that. Christians
are never to give in to the idolatry of our own religion by
condemning people in another religion on the basis of their worst
actors. We wouldn’t want them to do that to us, and we shouldn’t
do it to them. In fact, that’s part of what loving our neighbor as
ourselves is all about.
All right, back to the point, George. You’re always getting off on
tangents about how we should treat other religions and what not.
What’s that got to do with what’s new about this supposedly new
commandment to love one another? Well, a little, if not a lot. 
2
The first thing, then, is that the new commandment to love one
another is not new in that we are not commanded to love but that
we are commanded to love one another. I know this sounds
simple, but it’s not. The entire commandment to love our neighbor
is hard enough on its own, so hard that the Jews debated over and
over about who their neighbor was. That was the question that
gave rise to Jesus’ parable of the Good Samaritan. The point of the
question was to establish limits on the command to love.
And most of us want to do that if we’re being honest. Loving is
hard. It’s a lot easier in theory than in fact. It’s like the Charlie
Brown cartoon in which Lucy stands with her arms folded and a
resolute expression on her face while Charlie Brown pleads with
her. Lucy, he says, you must be more loving. The world needs love.
Make this world a better place, Lucy, by loving someone else. At that
Lucy whirls around angrily and Charlie goes flipping over
backward. Look, you blockhead, Lucy screams. The world I love. It’s
people I can’t stand!
Anyone? Well, Jesus doesn’t tell his disciples to love the world in
general, and he doesn’t even define what it means to love one’s
neighbor as oneself in this case. He turns them on each other and
tells them to love each other. The new commandment is that they
love one another.
Here’s the truth we all know from experience if we are honest: it’s
sometimes easier to love the world from a distance or even to love
our neighbor across the street whom we see only when we wave
as we get the newspaper in the morning than to love the people
closest to us. And if you don’t know that, you were probably
hatched from a pod, not born into a family.
The people we know the best and love the most are often the
people we hurt the worst and forgive the least. We vest so much
in the people who are closest to us. We trust them with our
secrets. We let our guard down with them. We share our most
frightening fears and our wildest dreams with them. And when
they betray or disappoint us, the pain is double or treble that of a
stranger. To love your sister or brother, your mother or father,
your son or daughter after a soul-rending rift is not natural. It
takes a commandment from Jesus to get us to accept our duty. 
3
And that is true in the church, of course. Jesus was talking to his
disciples, who always represent us. He wasn’t talking to James and
John about their blood- brother relationship. He was talking to
Peter and James and John and the others who were spiritual
brothers. Love one another. That’s the new commandment.
Does anyone in this room have a hard time loving anyone else in
this room? I’m talking to you, Wilshire. I’m talking to you, George.
If this were supposed to be easy, it wouldn’t be a commandment.
Jesus knows we need help loving when it’s hard. Loving when it’s
easy is no big deal, as when you first join the church and
everyone’s so nice to you. The members look after you, they pray
for your cousin with cancer, and they invite you to their Sunday
school class. They make you feel that you belong. And then one
day you open your mouth in class and say something that hurts
someone else’s feelings or offends the way someone else
believes—and, boom, following is the cold- shoulder treatment, or
the anger, or the tears.
Or let’s get right down to the present: you think the church should
hold your position on the extent of privileges we extend to gay
and lesbian Christians whom we all already welcome as members,
and someone you have always respected thinks differently.
Someone has perhaps said something harsh or offensive to you
about your view. And now you aren’t sure how you feel about
them or the church at all. What then?
Jesus said that the way we love one another as the church will be
the way the outside world will know that we are his disciples. He
didn’t say that it would be about whether we all agreed on the
right interpretation of the Second Coming or whether Calvin or
Arminius was right about the atonement or whether it’s more
moral or more immoral to perform same-gender marriages. He
said it would be the manner in which we love each other—even
when we are deeply at odds with each other over these important
things.
Think of when Jesus gives this new commandment. The passage
begins by saying, when HE had gone out. … Do you know who the
“he” was? Judas. Jesus has just told Judas that he would betray
him, Judas has left the table and gone out to do just that, and 
4
then—right then!—Jesus says that they are to love one another as
he has loved them. And right after this, Jesus tells Peter that he
will quickly deny him. In other words, sandwiched between two
kinds of betrayal, Jesus says that the disciples are to love one
another as he has loved them.
That’s the other qualifier of what’s new. What’s new is that they
are to love one another—the church is to make love the mark of
its life, no matter how hard it is. But how to do that is the other
part of the new: AS I have loved you, Jesus says.
And how has Jesus loved the disciples? He loved them all in order
to love each of them. He didn’t sacrifice some for the sake of
others.
John likes to say that he was the one whom Jesus loved. That’s fine
and dandy. We should all think Jesus loves us. But we shouldn’t
get into the game of which one of us he loves the most. Jesus loved
Judas as much as he loved the others. Jesus loved Peter as much as
he loved John and James.
In the church we have to be careful not to make it seem that we
have a hierarchy of whom Jesus loves or whom we deem more
worthy of love. As Michael Eric Dyson has put it: If God doesn’t love
all of us, [God] doesn’t love any of us.
But that doesn’t mean that we love each other in the same way. If
it’s true that Jesus loves them all in order to love each of them, it’s
also true that he loved all of them by loving each of them.
My oldest granddaughter, Finley, is almost 6. She’s the typical
always-wanting-to-do-the-right thing-and-please-her-elders
oldest child, don’t you know?! So her grandmother, Kim, whom
the kids call Giddy, was telling Finley that when she draws with
the colored pens, she needs to be extra sure to push the caps back
on them until she hears a click, so that the ink won’t run. Finley’s
sister, Zetta, is 4, and let’s just say that she isn’t an oldest child.
Zetta was coloring with the pens and not taking care to push the
caps on tightly. Finley was exasperated at her sister and reported
her irresponsible behavior to her grandmother. Giddy, she said, I
have tried to tell her, but she just won’t do it right. But Giddy knows
Zetta; she understands her age and personality, and she knows 
5
how she is different from her older sister. Grandmothers know
how to love all their grandchildren equally by loving each of them
differently. She resolved the issue by assuring Finley that they
could help Zetta put them on tight until she could learn to do it
right herself.
Our sisters and brothers in the church sometimes just don’t do
things right—or they just won’t do things the way we think are
right. We get exasperated, and we report them to the elders. We
think the same standards should apply to everyone. But Jesus
seems to have had more trouble with some of his disciples than
others. He loved them each as they were in order that each could
become more; he didn’t love them all as they should be, leaving
them frustrated that they weren’t like the others.
When we love one another as Jesus loved us, that love will spill
over from us to the world. When we try to love the world first, our
love for each other will be cold and sterile. When we love each
other first, our love will be warm and hospitable.
This past Thursday night our choir presented the Howard Goodall
requiem, Eternal Light. It was a gift to the community and a
collaboration with the Grief and Loss Center of North Texas,
which was started by Wilshire and headed by the remarkable
Laurie Taylor. Lucy Higginbotham spoke about how she became
acquainted with us. She had written a piece about the center a few
years ago for the White Rock Lake Weekly. And then to her
everlasting horror, she joined the dreaded sorority of mothers
who have lost a teenage son to suicide. Laurie and the center have
been a lifeline for her. When talking about it, she quoted John
13:34: A new commandment I give you, that you love one another
as I have loved you. By this the world will know that you are my
disciples, Jesus said. Lucy thanked the church for being that kind of
loving community for her, even though she isn’t a member of our
church.
Listen, that stuff doesn’t show up in the usual church box score
that measures whether we are successful. But maybe there’s
another scorekeeper somewhere who judges by other statistics,
such as how we love one another. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",4/24/2016,
"One of my and many other peoples’ favorite character to imitate is Forrest
Gump from the movie Forrest Gump. Such a classic movie with many great
scenes and memorable moments. One particular moment in the movie is
both hilarious and illustrative of Peter in this Scripture passage. After the
military, Forrest goes off to try being a shrimp boat captain and Lieutenant
Dan, with as much doubt as you can imagine, tells Forrest that if he ever
becomes a shrimp boat captain he would come and be his first mate.
Sure enough Forrest becomes a shrimp boat captain and one day on his way
back to the dock after having been out shrimping we see Forrest bent over,
looking off into the distance trying to make out this figure on the dock. It
takes him a moment but realizes it’s Lieutenant Dan. Forrest stands up and
waves real big. Then without even turning off the boat, he jumps overboard
and swims as fast as he can to the dock to greet Lieutenant Dan.
As they are greeting one another we see the boat go floating by crashing into
the dock. As calmly as he could, he looks at Lieutenant Dan and says, “That’s
my boat.”
Peter was SO excited to see Jesus that he jumped out of the boat and swam
as fast as he could to the shore to be with Jesus. Jesus was there to greet
him and the other disciples with a meal, fish being cooked over an open
flame on the beach. So many of Jesus’ intimate and sacred moments happen
over a meal and here comes another one with Peter.
After they had finished eating breakfast, they had one of the most
memorable conversations in scripture. Jesus and Peter go for a long walk on
the beach. Jesus doesn’t even warm up to it but gets right to the point,
“Simon, son of John, do you love me?” UGH. A punch to the gut for Peter.
“You’re questioning my love? Yes. You know I love you.” This happens not
once but three times which corresponds to Peter’s three denials. Each time,
Jesus doesn’t shout ‘hurray’ but gives Peter a job to do. Jesus is 
2
commissioning Peter and letting him know it’s time to step up and learn how
to be a shepherd. Jesus is sharing his work and ministry with Peter.
Even further, Jesus’s asking about Peter’s love for him is also a since of
reminder and confirmation for Peter about the love he has for Jesus as he
begins this journey of shepherding.
It also instills the notion that as followers of Christ, love is behind every bit of
work and ministry that we do. N.T. Wright says, “Here is the secret of all
Christian ministry, yours and mine, lay and ordained...It’s the secret of
everything from being a quiet back-row member of a prayer group to being a
platform speaker at huge rallies and conferences. If you are going to do any
single solitary thing as a follower and servant of Jesus, this is what it’s built
on. Somewhere, deep down inside, there is a love for Jesus, and though
you’ve let him down enough times, he wants to find that love, to give you a
chance to express it, to heal the hurts and failures of the past, and give you
new work to do.”
Jesus has seen Peter’s all-or-nothing attitude since he first called him so he
knew he would get Peter’s all. Peter didn’t always say the best things or even
do the right thing but whatever he did, he did with everything he had. This
included diving out of a boat in order to be with Jesus, so he wasn’t worried
about Peter working hard. He wanted to ensure that Peter knew that all that
he did wasn’t going to be coming out of selfish ambition or motive but
coming out of his love for Jesus.
Acknowledging our love for God isn’t the end of our faith journey but only
the beginning. In order for love to mean something, an expression of that
love is needed. As we begin our faith journey one of the greatest expressions
of love we can demonstrate is the same as Peter’s. Jesus said, “Feed my
sheep.”
If we love Jesus, our lives must reflect the love we have. Our lives aren’t lived
to earn or even prove that we love God. As we know, we could never do
enough. We are going to fail. We are going to fall short. We are going to be
wrong. This is the radical part of the Gospel and the way God chose to bring
God’s kingdom to the world. Jesus has come and chosen a bunch of folks
who are broken and who fail to change the world. So many people look at
their lives and think they aren’t good enough to follow Christ or that they 
3
don’t have anything to offer. Their awareness of their brokenness paralyzes
them rather than freeing them up. What a sad thing!
Look at Peter’s past. He was always quick to stick his foot in his mouth. He
was rebuked by Jesus. He denied Jesus three times and abandoned him at
the cross. And guess what? Jesus is now commissioning Peter to follow him.
What a huge message of love and grace for Peter in that moment. He knows
he’s messed up in the past but Jesus is still putting trust in Peter to tend the
flock.
Jesus is doing the same thing with us. None of us are more important than
the other. We all are called to tend the flock in some way, shape or form.
This is the joy and the responsibility of adhering to the priesthood of all
believers and soul competency. As followers of Christ, each of us is called to
feed the lambs and tend the sheep. We are responsible for one another. This
is what we call a church--Aa pen full of sheep in need of shepherding and we
all shepherd each other. This is why we have discussions and make churchwide
decisions rather than receiving commands. We want to make sure that
we are paying respect to and honoring the thoughts and beliefs of every
sheep in the flock.
We keep each other accountable, we challenge one another, we celebrate
with one another and we comfort and grieve with one another. We need
each other. Without each other we are alone and life isn’t meant to be lived
that way. We need God. We need the community in order to grow into the
person God has created us to be.
I heard a very defining statement about the church in a recent conversation I
was having with a church member. We were talking about how we can often
lose our focus in the church and it becomes about ourselves rather than
about each other. This person said something that really struck me and I’ll
never forget it. They said, “You may wake up on a Sunday morning and not
feel like going to church because you may not need it that day. But what if
someone else in the church has had a rough week and does need it. What if
someone else needs you to be there for them that day?”
Isn’t that what Jesus means by tending the sheep? Paul did say that when
one part of the body suffers, the whole body suffers and when one part of
the body rejoices, the whole body rejoices. 
4
This is why we worship together but it’s even more so why we have Sunday
School classes. It would be impossible for one person to care for every single
person in this church. It’s a large church! But we have these groups so we
can have individual corrals of people within the greater church.
We spend time together getting to know one another. We’re there at the
births of children. We’re there at the deaths of friends and loved ones. We
work together to find sheep outside of our particular flock to tend to
because although we exist to feed and tend to one another, we are also
called to tend to those who are outside our flock. Principalities and powers
are ruling the world creating systems of poverty and injustice and we are to
help tend to those affected by the system as well as help to transform the
system.
As individuals, we may not be able to change the whole system but we can
help and be present in the lives of those who are hurting and crying out for
help.
This week I read a story about a missionary who was in an orphanage in
Uganda. He had been in many orphanages before but this one was different.
He walked into a nursery with over 100 cribs filled with babies. He listened in
amazement and wonder as the only sound he could hear was silence. A
sound that is beyond rare in ANY nursery, let alone a nursery where over 100
new babes lay. He turned to his host and asked her why the nursery was
silent.
She looked at him and said, ""After about a week of them being here, and
crying out for countless hours, they eventually stop when they realize no one
is coming for them...""
People all around us are crying out. It Maybe they are in pain. Maybe
because of injustice and most definitely because they need someone to help.
As followers of Christ, it is our responsibility and calling to feed and care for
these sheep. We don’t ever want to get to a point where people become
silent and give up on the church or even worse, give up on God because the
church doesn’t respond to their cries. 
5
One thing I love about the interaction between Jesus and Peter is that when
Jesus says “Feed my sheep,” he doesn’t say how. Jesus is calling Peter to
follow him and devote his life to Jesus. Feed, tend, feed. Some might feel
that Jesus left us hanging by not telling Peter or us how to feed the sheep or
take care of the flock. Perhaps he was speaking literally. We are to feed
people. There is definitely a need for this interpretation. There are people all
over the world who are starving and many of them are children. Some
people feel called to this literal interpretation of feeding the sheep and
that’s great because the world needs it.
But tending the flock can be expressed in different ways according to the
passions and gifts of the person. Some are called to be pastors, teachers,
preachers, evangelists, doctors, lawyers, politicians (I think). The point being
that no matter what we do, we should be doing it to tend the flock out of
our love for Christ. Not just because it’s the right thing to do. Not just to
make the world a better place. Those are good things but they only come
from a love for Christ.
Because we love Jesus, we can’t help but love the flock and work for what’s
best for the whole, not just to keep ourselves comfortable and out of danger
or pain. When we love deeply, we will naturally do things that may put us at
risk. But when we are tending the flock, one thing is certain--we live for the
best of the whole, not just for ourselves. We do this no matter the difficulty
because Christ loved us first.
Do you love him? Follow him.
Amen. ",Matthew Broyles,"Dallas, TX",4/10/2016,
"When God chooses a leader: Nehemiah 1:11

Introduction: President-elect and Mrs. Trump, Vice-President-elect and Mrs. Pence, families and friends, it’s an honor to be with you on this historic day.

President-elect Trump, I remember that it was exactly one year ago this weekend that I was with you on your Citation jet flying around Iowa before the first caucus or primary vote was cast. After our Wendy’s cheeseburgers, I said that I believed that you would be the next President of the United States. And if that happened, it would be because God had placed you there.

As the prophet Daniel said, it is God who removes and establishes leaders.

Today ? one year later ? God has raised you and Vice-President-elect Pence up for a great, eternal purpose.

When I think of you, President-elect Trump, I am reminded of another great leader God chose thousands of years ago in Israel. The nation had been in bondage for decades, the infrastructure of the country was in shambles, and God raised up a powerful leader to restore the nation. And the man God chose was neither a politician nor a priest. Instead, God chose a builder whose name was Nehemiah.

And the first step of rebuilding the nation was the building of a great wall. God instructed Nehemiah to build a wall around Jerusalem to protect its citizens from enemy attack. You see, God is NOT against building walls!

And the Old Testament book of Nehemiah records how Nehemiah completed that massive project in record time — just 52 days.

Why was Nehemiah so successful in building the wall and rebuilding the nation?

I. Nehemiah Refused To Allow His Critics To Distract Him

Someone has said there are three guaranteed ways to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing.

Any true leader is going to face criticism.

President-elect Trump, you have had your share of critics from the day you announced you were running for President, but you’ve confounded them at every turn. First, they said you couldn’t win the nomination, but you ended up garnering the most votes of any Republican in history. Then they said that was a fluke, but you couldn’t win the election. And you handily defeated your opponent. And now your critics say you can’t possibly succeed in your agenda.

Nehemiah had his own share of critics. Two of his chief antagonists were named Sanballat and Tobiah. They were the mainstream media of their day. They continued to hound and heckle Nehemiah and spread false rumors while he and the Israelites were building the wall.

At one point, they said, “Nehemiah, you need to stop the project and come down from the wall and have a meeting with us.”

Nehemiah’s response was classic: “I’m doing a great work . . . why should I stop the work and come down to you?” (Nehemiah 6:3)

President-elect Trump, you, Vice President-elect Pence, and your team have been called by God and elected by the people to do a great work. It is a work far too important to stop and answer your critics.

II. Nehemiah Refused To Allow Setbacks To Stop Him

As you read through Nehemiah’s journal, you’ll find that he faced tremendous obstacles as he attempted to rebuild the nation: an economic recession, terrorist attacks from enemies, and discouragement among the citizens.

But none of those setbacks was enough to stop Nehemiah.

Some years ago two sports commentators on television were discussing the late Hall of Famer Walter Peyton, the running back for the Chicago Bears. One commentator said, “Can you believe that during his career Peyton has run more than nine miles with a football?”

The other commentator replied, “What’s even more amazing is that every 3.8 yards of those nine miles Peyton got knocked down by a guy twice his size! But he got back up every time and kept moving forward in spite of those bruising hits and hard knocks.”

President Trump, you, your team and your families are going to face some bruising setbacks. But remember . .

The true measure of a leader is what it takes to stop him. And knowing you, I believe it’s going to take a lot to stop you.

(Finally)

III. Nehemiah Sought God’s Help To Empower Him

Nehemiah was a gifted leader, but he knew he could not succeed without God’s divine help. And that is why as he began the great work, Nehemiah knelt before God and prayed:

“O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant who delights in revering your name. Give your servant success today . . .” (Nehemiah 1:11)

Mr. President-elect, I don’t believe we have ever had a president with as many natural gifts as you. As you know, the reason I endorsed you within weeks of your announcement that you were running was because I believed that you were the only candidate who possessed the leadership skills necessary to reverse the downward trajectory of our nation.

And beginning with Vice President-elect Pence ? a great and godly man ? you’ve assembled an unbelievably talented group of advisers around you.

But the challenges facing our nation are so great that it will take more than natural ability to meet them. We need God’s supernatural power.

The good news is that the same God who empowered Nehemiah nearly 2500 years ago is available to every one of us today who is willing to humble himself and ask for His help. God says in Psalm 50:15 “Call upon Me in the day of trouble I shall rescue you and you will honor Me.”

When President Ronald Reagan addressed the Republican National Convention in my city of Dallas in 1984 he said, “America needs God more than God needs America. If we ever forget that we are “one nation under God,” then we will be a nation gone under.”

President-elect Trump, you had a campaign slogan that resonated with tens of millions of Americans because it spoke to their heartfelt desire: “Make America Great Again.”

Psalm 33:12 gives us the starting point for making that happen: “Blessed — great — is the nation whose God is the Lord.”

May God bless President-elect Trump, Vice-President-elect Pence, their families and advisers. And may God truly bless the United States of America.",Robert Jeffress,"Washington, DC",1/20/2017,
"Happy Easter. It’s still Easter, you know—Easter being a season, not just
a day, and judging by the good attendance today, I think you do know.
Well done, Wilshire. But just to confuse you a little more, our text today
from John 20 begins a week ago on Easter night and then skips forward
a week to today.
So John’s Easter story from last week has Jesus being raised from the
dead and appearing first to Mary Magdalene. She then reports this to the
disciples, and the Big Three—Peter, James and John—run to the tomb to
see him. Jesus doesn’t make an appearance to them at the empty tomb,
thus leaving them empty and confused. They go back to a room, lock the
doors and cower in fear of persecution from the Jews.
Now a quick word about this phrase, “for fear of the Jews.” Keep in mind
that all of the disciples who feared the Jews were Jews. They never
stopped being Jews after they began to believe in Jesus as the Christ.
When John wrote this in the latter part of the first century, believers in
Jesus who were Jews had been kicked out of the synagogues and told
that they weren’t real Jews. So this is sort of a family feud we are
overhearing. It would be better for us today to read it as the religious
leaders who conspired to have Jesus crucified and would have wanted
to prevent the disciples from spreading stories about the resurrection.
Not all Jews. Just those Jews.
Let’s think about these disciples. They are filled with worry about what
would happen to them. If the Roman authorities killed Jesus under the
influence of the Jewish authorities, maybe they would just go ahead and
finish off his followers, too. This is not irrational fear. Faith and fear
always coexist, but the question is, which shall prevail?
We hear a lot these days about how fear is behind the appeal of some
politicians, but it’s also unrealistic to expect people who are
experiencing loss of jobs, declining wages and a feeling that they are not
being paid attention to, to just to shrug it off and live with grace toward
others. But we all of us have to overcome some fear if we are going to be 
2
Christ followers. And the good news is that Christ himself is the one who
helps us with that.
Mary and the disciples did not believe in the resurrection until they saw
and experienced Jesus as risen. The angels gave Mary the word about it,
but it took her encounter with Jesus himself in the garden before she
believed it. It was the same with the disciples in the locked room that
Jesus entered without a key. They saw him for themselves, and he spoke
to them. Peace, he said. In other words, Be at peace. I know you are
afraid; but if they killed me and God brought me back to life, you don’t
have to fear anyone but God from this day forward. As Julian of Norwich
put it: All is well, all is well, and all manner of things shall be well.
Then Jesus showed them his hands and side. He passed the peace to
them again and breathed into them the breath of life, telling them to go
practice forgiveness as the mark of their resurrection faith.
It’s interesting to note that he breathed on them, and they received the
Holy Spirit. This is a creation move, or maybe we should say re-creation.
God had taken a lifeless being made from clay and breathed into him the
breath of life, and he became the first human. Now Jesus did the same
with his disciples, and they were made fully alive. Born again?
The Romans had a cruel practice of torture that went way beyond
waterboarding. They would tie up an enemy face to face with a dead
person. The living person would breathe in the effluvia of death until it
would kill him, too. The Roman poet Virgil, who wrote The Aeneid,
penned these gruesome lines about it: The living and the dead at his
command/Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand;/Till chok’d with
stench, in loath’d embraces tied,/the ling’ring wretches pin’d away and
died.
Here’s the reversal of that. A man who was supposed to be dead and
hadn’t eaten in three days now breathed on them, and instead of
smelling death, they came to life. Go figure.
So what have we learned so far about the way of knowing that we call
faith or belief? First, it is grounded in the truth. Jesus was raised. If he
had not been raised, none of this would change anything. Belief would 
3
be only wishful thinking, not a way of knowing what is true but can’t be
proved empirically.
Second, the first disciples saw the risen one with their own eyes because
he came to them personally. Faith is a kind of knowledge that comes
from personal encounter. It’s about the who more than the what. We
know the risen Christ because he is risen, and we know him because he
makes himself known to us. He shows himself to us. He reveals himself
to us.
If you want to know someone intimately, that person has to open up to
you, reveal himself or herself to you. You know people when you know
their hearts. You can investigate only so far; in the end your relationship
depends on whether that one opens up to you.
Jesus opens up to disciples by showing them his wounds. His words and
his wounds together are both important in knowing him. This is how we
see the risen one. We see him as the wounded warrior of love that
conquered hate and death and fear.
My daughter Cameron was at Wake Forest Divinity School this week to
speak at the retirement dinner of her favorite theology professor, Frank
Tupper. She recounted how she came to understand the doctrine of the
Trinity in a deep and fresh way. She had been reading Juergen
Moltmann’s book, The Trinity and the Kingdom, and she was so taken
with how the history of the Son of God is such that God has taken up into
God’s own eternal life the wounds of the world through Jesus’ wounds.
She was enraptured by this thought. My daughter, don’t you know?! She
read all night and then went to see Dr. Tupper in his office the next
morning. He told her that she had just become a theologian. She
recounted that moment at his dinner, talking about the blessing it
represented. But she also told me that Dr. Tupper never let anyone in
his classes talk about the resurrection without the crucifixion. The Risen
One is always and only the Crucified One.
We only know the resurrection of a Christ who continues to bear the
marks of his suffering in his hands and side. And if we look for him
anywhere in the world where there are no apparent wounds, we will
not see him or believe in him. This is what Richard Rohr calls God’s bias 
4
from the bottom. The risen Christ did not appear to the beautiful people
or the powerful; he appeared to those at the bottom, those on the
margins, those who knew something about suffering.
This is why Thomas, who was absent on Easter night when Jesus
appeared to his disciples, wanted to be able to see and touch the
wounded Savior. He wasn’t asking for anything more than the others
had been given, which makes me think we’ve given Thomas a bad rap as
the doubter. When the Lord himself appeared to Thomas and showed
him his wounds, Thomas didn’t even touch him. He simply believed,
saying, My Lord and my God.
We should back up at this point. Remember when Jesus told his
disciples in John 14 that he was going to prepare a place for them and
that they would know the way to the place he was preparing? It was
Thomas who asked how they could know they way. Jesus said to him, I
am the way, the truth and the life. … In doing so, he was saying that he
himself is the way to knowing the way to God. And now that Thomas
had seen Jesus himself in his everlasting woundedness, he believed. He
now knew the way.
This is what Thomas carried with him the rest of his life. Tradition and
legend say he became one of the most powerful witnesses to the gospel.
St. Thomas Christians are found in the East, where tradition claims that
Thomas went as a missionary to India. He is also the patron saint of
architects because he inspired the construction of so many churches.
Thomas represents a way of knowing the resurrected Christ that is seen
in the church’s encounter with the suffering of the world. We know the
risen One who was crucified by engaging personally with the wounded
of the world.
Jen Hatmaker is a blogger whose blogs are read by some of our church’s
young women. She and her pastor/husband, Brandon, live in Austin. Jen
was the keynote speaker this week at the Christian Life Commission
conference in San Antonio. She told a story her husband recounted in a
book titled The Barefoot Church. It came about when on one Easter
night, Jen and Brandon attended a worship service led by Shane
Claiborne. They had read his book and corresponded with him. When 
5
Shane told them he’d be in Austin on that Easter night, they went, even
though they were dead tired after conducting six services that morning.
Shane told about being in San Antonio the day before and meeting with
homeless men and women. He asked them what they needed most, and
they said it was shoes. So that night, at the end of worship, as he invited
worshipers to participate in Holy Communion, Shane decided to tell
about those homeless friends. He invited anyone who felt so led to bring
their shoes and socks to the Table of the Lord with them. They would
wash the socks and give them, along with the collected shoes, to the
homeless, who were especially needy at that time because there was a
late cold spell and snowfall.
Brandon and Jen looked down at their feet and saw the prized cowboy
boots each was wearing that night. They had given them to each other
as gifts. They immediately wished that the weather had been warmer
and they were wearing their usual flip flops. But they knew in their
hearts what they needed to do. Jen says she took off her boots, clutched
them one last time in her arms, gave them a kiss, and left them at the
altar. They, along with many others that night, walked out into the snow
with bare feet, knowing Christ in a way they never had before.
Our Wilshire kids are in Fort Worth this weekend. Along with kids from
Broadway Baptist, they have been assembling hygiene kits and other
essentials for the homeless. I wonder if they have seen Jesus there.
According to Thomas’s way of knowing, that just might be the surest
place to see him.  ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",4/3/2016,
"My mother spoke for many of us earlier this week. In the light of
more ISIS terror bombings, this time in Brussels—not to mention so
much other chaos and uncertainty that seem to have the world offkilter—she
lamented over the dinner table: I just feel so empty this
year during Holy Week.
I just feel so empty. Anyone else? Seems easy to go there right now.
And where my mom and dad are concerned, it’s even easier to
understand. They don’t get out much these days. My dad was 90 in
January, and the cancer has slowed him down, although gratefully it
hasn’t sapped his spirit. I had him out on the range hitting golf balls
on Good Friday. His shots were not long, but they were dead
straight, don’t you know?! Still, some days their house feels more
like a tomb than a refuge.
In this work I do, I speak—more than most of us—to people living in
the shadow of death. A woman who had lost her husband talks about
the empty feeling of life without him. A young woman whose
husband will die of cancer soon already feels the emptiness of the
dreams of their life together slipping away. And then there’s the
empty feeling of getting older that you sense in the daily reminders
of not being able to go and do things as you once did, seeing a shift
from your generation to the next, or feeling the power go out of your
influence over things. Empty, indeed.
But isn’t emptiness an Easter theme? I mean, isn’t this whole day,
which is at the root of our faith, about the empty tomb? Well, yes,
sort of.
When the women went to the tomb of Jesus that day and found it
empty, they must have felt empty themselves. They had lost the man
they had loved so dearly, the one they had put so much hope in. He
was the one who, as long as he was with them, had the power to fill
their emptiness. 
2
When the wine ran out, he turned water into wine, and when there
were only five loaves and two small fish for 5,000 empty bellies, he
multiplied the bread and made it a feast. When illness—leprosy,
fever or demon possession—strained all the life from people they
knew, he was there to touch them and heal them. And when they felt
the boot of Rome crushing their spirits and robbing their faith of
God’s promises to Israel, he was there to talk about the presence of
the kingdom of God that no earthly power could thwart.
And yet they killed him. They crucified the Lord and dashed their
hopes. So then these empty women went to the tomb to care for his
body and assuage their own grief and sorrow. And they found that
they couldn’t even count on that. Now even the tomb was empty. For
God’s sake.
They didn’t spontaneously break into the “Hallelujah” chorus
because they immediately believed he had been raised. In that
moment they must have thought, isn’t there anything in this world
we could count on?
Jeremy was not a normal child. He had a terminal illness that
affected both his body and his mind. Still, his parents had tried to
give him as normal a life as possible and had sent him to a Christian
school. At the age of 12, Jeremy was only in second grade, seemingly
unable to learn.
As Easter approached that spring, their teacher told the children the
Jesus story. Then to emphasize the idea of new life springing forth,
she gave each of them a large plastic egg with this assignment: I
want you to take this home and bring it back tomorrow with
something inside that shows new life. Do you understand?
All the children responded enthusiastically, except for Jeremy. He
just listened carefully, his eyes never leaving the teacher’s face. Had
he understood what she had said about Jesus' death and
resurrection? Did he understand the assignment? The teacher
thought she should probably call his parents and explain the project
to them, but she got busy and forgot. 
3
The next morning, 19 children came to school, laughing and talking
as they placed their eggs in a large wicker basket on Miss Miller’s
desk. After they completed their math lesson, it was time to open the
eggs. In the first egg, Miss Miller found a flower. She said, Oh, yes, a
flower is certainly a sign of new life. When plants peek through the
ground, we know that spring is here. A small girl in the first row
waved her arms. That’s my egg, Miss Miller, she called out.
The next egg contained a plastic butterfly. The teacher held it up. We
all know that a caterpillar changes and grows into a beautiful
butterfly. Yes, that is new life, too. Little Judy smiled proudly and said,
Miss Miller, that one is mine!
Next the teacher found a rock with moss on it. She explained that
moss, too, showed life. Billy spoke up from the back of the
classroom, saying, My daddy helped me!
Then the teacher opened the fourth egg. It was empty! She figured
immediately that it was Jeremy’s and, she kicked herself for not
calling his parents. She didn’t want to embarrass Jeremy, so she
quietly set the egg aside and reached for another. Jeremy spoke up.
Miss Miller, aren’t you going to talk about my egg? A bit flustered, the
teacher said, But, Jeremy, your egg is empty! He looked into her eyes
and said softly, Yes, but Jesus’ tomb was empty, too!1
Yes, it was. And maybe it takes someone like Jeremy to remind us of
that. Someone who doesn’t spend every moment looking for signs of
life. Someone acquainted with emptiness. Like the women who were
first at the tomb and first to learn the truth, because in that day and
time they had little to lose, anyway.
You see, before you can know the fullness of resurrection life, you
have to know the emptiness of the tomb. Before you can understand
what is possible because Jesus has been raised, you have to let go of
hoping in a world bent on killing hope.

he is discouraged about where his party is right now. He believes the
old models of the way the world is organized are outmoded and
need replacing. Here’s the sentence that jumped out at me: The first
step clearly is mental purging: casting aside many existing mental
categories and presuppositions, to shift your identity from one with a
fixed mind-set to one in which you are a seeker and open to anything.2
A seeker and open to anything. There it is. Why do you seek the living
among the dead? the angels ask the women. He is not here, but has
risen.
What I want to say to you today is that Easter is about more than an
empty tomb; it’s about an open tomb. There’s a difference.
Emptiness is about what’s lost; openness is about what’s found.
Emptiness is about absence; openness is about presence. Emptiness
is based on only what we have known until now; openness is about
what can now be known because something new has happened.
Think about this: God could have raised Jesus from the dead and left
the stone in place. The tomb could have remained sealed, and we
would never have known any better. But the resurrection of Jesus
was not just about Jesus. It was about all the powers of the world
being defeated, including death and all those powers of that have a
death grip on our hearts.
So the tomb was empty, but it was also open. Open to the world.
Open to the world so that the world might be opened.
Easter is not a one-time event that happened for one man. It is an
ongoing experience of hope for every man and woman. It opens the
closed world to a new mode of living. The risen Savior didn’t go to
directly into the presence of God; he went directly into the world
that had taken his life. God gave him resurrection life so that he
could give resurrection life to us.
Why we come here on Easter year after year is not to celebrate our
faith in a one-off resurrection, but rather to renew our hope in resurrection life for us all.
And that should change everything. For one thing, it means that no
matter how noble our politics, no matter how powerful our military,
no matter how strong our economy, there is something more and
better to hope in. When Jesus told the Roman governor, Pontius
Pilate, that his kingdom is not of this world, he meant what he said.
He is the Eternal King of an Eternal Kingdom. Our hope is not in this
life alone. Our hope is not in a world that will always leave us empty.
Our hope is in the kingdom of God, which is ruled even now by the
risen Christ.
But since the risen Christ, who is Lord of all, is loose in the world
today through the presence of his Spirit, we can see signs of him
everywhere. Not just in flowers and butterflies and moss on rocks,
but in the surprising act of forgiveness and in the wonder of
unconditional love. In the willingness to side with the weak and
vulnerable and marginalized, even to the point of suffering with and
for them because Christ died and was raised for all of us, not just for
some of us. In the faith that is born in someone whose heart had
been as cold as the stone tomb of Jesus.
And speaking of hearts, the fourth-century Egyptian saint, Macarius,
turned Easter inward when he said: When you hear of tombs, do not
think only of visible ones. Your own heart is a tomb.3
So in that spirit I want to say to you today that the secret of
resurrection is not found in answering the question of how it
happened in the heart of that garden tomb; it’s found in how it
happens in the tomb of your own heart.
God’s uplifting work is still Eastering hearts everywhere through the
power of the Holy Spirit. That work is not about the absence of
anything but about the presence of Christ. It’s not about
accommodating ourselves to a life that is passing away but about
embracing the life that is coming to pass. In other words, God’s
Eastering work in our hearts is not about emptiness at all; it’s about openness to all.
As my dear friend and Brooklyn colleague, Gary Simpson, so
eloquently puts it:
Empty will make you weep;
Open will make you shout.
Empty will paralyze you into doing nothing;
Open will make you want to do something.
Empty will make you sing the blues;
Open will make you sing praises.
Empty says, ‘It’s over’;
Open says, ‘It’s just starting.’
Empty will make you think you are all alone.
Open will let you know you are never by yourself.
Empty will make you want to resign;
Open will make you re-sign.
So what is your Easter heart signing up for now? Is it faith? Is it
hope? Is it love? If the tomb is open, shouldn’t you be? Amen. 

",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",3/27/2016,
"The clever Disney/Pixar animated movie Inside Out imaginatively
gives us a rare look inside the human head. In this case it’s the head
of an 11-year-old Minnesota girl named Riley, whose life up to that
point was nothing but joy, joy, joy. Joy, in fact, the key emotion we
get to see is running the control center of Riley’s brain. The movie
shows us how the child’s life is driven by the interaction of emotions
like joy, fear, anger, sadness and disgust—all of which operate in the
“head”-quarters of Riley’s body. They monitor her every interaction
with the world. Joy sees to it that as Riley develops, she keeps strong
positive long-term memories that will sustain her happiness
throughout life. Part of Joy’s job, therefore, is to rein in the other
emotions, like Fear and Anger, and especially Sadness.
The crisis comes when Riley’s family moves to San Francisco to
accommodate her dad’s new job. This event also coincides, of course,
with the first movement from childhood to adolescence, which
makes it a double crisis, don’t you know?! Suddenly, Joy loses
control over Riley’s response to external circumstances. She can’t
protect her any longer from negative emotions. And Riley begins to
be directed more from the outside in than from the inside out.
The movie is the story of how this situation plays out. Joy overplays
her role, trying to protect Riley. In doing so, she and Sadness are
temporarily driven from the control center, leaving the other
emotions in charge. When Riley listens to them, she thinks that her
only way to deal with her pain is to go back to where she came from.
But that means breaking with her parents, the ones she now blames
for taking her away from the life she used to love. This mistrust of
her father and mother is at the root of her problem. She thinks the
answer is to run back to the place where she was once happy.
What the personified emotion, Joy, discovers in her attempt to save
Riley is that the real key to Riley’s survival is to learn to handle all
her emotions, not just to be driven by a desire for happiness. Riley’s
salvation, so to speak, requires Sadness to have its way with her, too, 
2
but without breaking her spirit. Riley has to stay connected to her
parents and be willing to walk through the pain rather than away
from it. That’s what grownups do—they don’t run away when things
get hard, and they don’t let trying times dictate their actions; they
stay connected to those they love, and they live from the inside out.
I’m not sure there could be a better way of telling the story of Jesus
as he makes his way to the cross.
In most cases, biblical writers tell stories through action and
dialogue, not by giving us access to what’s going on inside the heads
of the characters. But it isn’t always hard to guess, and sometimes
that’s what happens in the epistles, when writers like Paul talk about
actions as if they were going on not just visibly on the stage of
history, but also backstage—that is, invisibly— between the
characters and God. That’s what the early church hymn does when it
speaks of Christ’s humility, his refusal to give in to selfish ambition,
and his redemptive suffering.
When Paul quotes this early church hymn in Philippians 2, he uses it
to show how Jesus saves. Luke tells the gospel story as an unfolding
narrative, but like every story or movie, you have to sit and reflect
on it afterward to ask what it means. How is it, in other words, that
Jesus’ dying on the cross is a defining event in the salvation of the
world and not just a one more example of and injustice being done
by the gruesome lynching of an innocent man?
The Philippian hymn answers that by going to the heart of what
happened in Jesus. It can be read two ways, both of them important.
One reading is the invisible story. The eternal Son of God—the
second person of the Trinity, who has every right to remain in
heavenly bliss, untouched by the world—humbles himself,
renounces his privilege, enters the world of human flesh, and takes
on the suffering and death of sinful humankind. In doing so, he keeps
faith with his Father in heaven, no matter how difficult and painful
his life gets. The inside story of salvation is found in God’s selfgiving.
The Father gives the Son to the world out of love. The Son
gives himself to the Father’s will, no matter how hard. And they
remain one even as death enters the very life of God. Death cannot
separate them, although it feels like that to Jesus in the moment of 
3
his death as he cries out, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
It turns out God has not forsaken Jesus—the Father has not forsaken
the Son, but it was necessary for God to experience every emotion
we human beings feel in our lostness if we are to be saved. As the
venerable saint, Athanasius, put it: What is not assumed is not healed.
That is, God can heal only what God has taken into God’s own life.
The resurrection of Jesus is God’s vindication of sacrificial love over
sacrificing power. Or said another way, it shows that the power of
love conquers the love of power.
The other way to read the Christ hymn is to see it as the visible story
of humanity doing it right for the first time. The Second Adam
corrects the error of the First Adam. Whereas the First Adam was
not content to live humbly under God’s rule and instead grasped for
the forbidden fruit in order to be his own god, the Second Adam
refused to grasp for it. He faithfully remained connected to God and
refused to succumb to the temptation to assume power for himself.
He lived from the inside out. His crucifixion demonstrates that the
outside world of self-seeking ambition is truly lost in the end. The
power of God judges the power of the world once and for all.
Now, keeping both perspectives in mind, we turn back to Luke. On
Palm Sunday Jesus comes riding into Jerusalem on a donkey,
demonstrating humility. The people adore him, mostly because they
see him as their hope of throwing off the occupying power of Rome.
Their idea of salvation is liberation from the military domination of
the Romans. Make no mistake, the spiritual cries of Hosanna on Palm
Sunday are also political rallying cries.
And that’s what gets the religious leaders nervous. They have made
a bargain with the Romans to keep the peace in return for letting
them continue to worship and carry out their religious exercises
before God. What that really means is that they had reinterpreted
their faith in exclusively inner spiritual terms that wouldn’t be
threatening to the Romans’ way of controlling the world.
And we do that today, don’t we? If you grew up in the Evangelical
tradition of Christianity, you know that the “born again” language of
faith is mostly concerned with your inside relationship to God. In
fact, you get really nervous when I talk about things like payday 
4
lending, which abuses the poor, or the way our public schools are
undermined by the self-interest of the wealthy, or the way racial
prejudice continues to plague our justice system. Stick to spiritual
things, George. Don’t get into politics or business.
Well, that’s what the religious leaders were saying when they went
to the Roman governor, Pilate, and said that Jesus was “perverting
our nation.” They twisted Jesus’ brilliant words about rending unto
Caesar what is Caesar’s and unto God what is God’s and claimed the
opposite of what Jesus meant. What was really happening is that
they were worried that he was going to disturb their peace; that is,
they were worried that they were going to lose their control over the
people.
In his book The Freedom Revolution and the Churches, Robert Spike
recalls an incident from the early years of the turbulent civil rights
movement of the 1960s that sought to make the full rights of black
Americans a reality in everyday life. Flying out of Jackson,
Mississippi, Spike overhears the conversation of a Catholic nun, who
is sitting across the aisle from him with her seat companion. The
sister is lamenting all the unrest in Mississippi, and she complains
about the “outside agitators”—the students and church leaders who
have come to her state in support of civil rights, certain that their
presence is provoking violence on the part of white racists. I do not
question their dedication, nor even the rightness of their position, said
the sister. But surely it is a bad thing to create turmoil by stirring up
people who feel differently. As the sister talks, all the while she is
nervously fingering a cross hanging around her neck.
There’s a tragic irony in the sister’s words and actions, not unlike
that of the first Holy Week. For the one whose cross the sister holds
dearest—Jesus—would never have taken the risk of going to
Jerusalem and proclaiming a new way of living, would never have
confronted comfortable patterns and ultimately endured the cross,
had he followed the sister’s philosophy.1
But if that kind of pietism ends up leaving the world to the Pilates
and Herods who only keep people from experiencing the world as
God intends it to be, there’s a form of progressivism in Christianity that wants to turn everything into politics. And to be fair, there’s a
form of conservative Christianity that thinks that, too. This approach
seems to think that salvation would finally be achieved if we elected
the right people, passed the right laws, and created a perfect
external world. But to do that, you end up playing a politics that
Jesus would not play.
Listen, salvation is about the redemption of all things. We have to
stop reducing our faith to Jesus being only our personal Savior,
when he can be that only if he is also the Savior of the world. But we
also have to stop reducing our faith to Jesus being only the Savior of
the world, when he also must be our personal Savior.
When Jesus had the chance to confront the powers and claim his
kingship, he refused to do so. He wasn’t afraid to fight; he was just
not willing to waste his power on anything less than everything.
I was talking to a dad the other day who was telling me about his 11-
year-old son who got into a fight on the basketball court at school.
(Apparently, 11-year-olds have a lot to teach us today.) His wise
coach took him aside, and instead of telling him he was right or
wrong, he told him that he should never waste his powers. He
needed to gather his powers by controlling his emotions and
directing them in the right ways. Brilliant. Live from the inside out,
in other words.
And if we are to join Jesus in his resurrection life of victory over the
world of sin and death, we must join him in his way of living from
the inside out.
Ernest Hemingway said: The best people possess a feeling for beauty,
the courage to take risks, the discipline to tell the truth, the capacity
for sacrifice. Ironically, their virtues make them, vulnerable; they are
often wounded, sometimes destroyed.
He could have been describing the inside-out way of Jesus. This is
the path of redemption. If only we would follow it.

"To be a good Christian, it helps to be bad at math.
Now, I know some of my math friends around here will object. And
they should if I were talking about actual numbers. Of course it’s
true that you can’t understand the structure of the universe in all of
its glory and beauty without doing higher math. Astrophysicists are
mathematicians for a reason. Their equations tell us that the cosmos
is ordered in an intelligent way by a Creator who doesn’t play dice
with the world, as Einstein put it.
I admit that I’m more of a word guy than a numbers person, don’t
you know?! But I don’t want to be blamed for someone else’s
miscalculations. Being good at math can keep you out of trouble. We
certainly don’t want our kids going to school and telling their math
teachers that the preachers at their churches told them that being
bad at math makes them a good Christian. And I don’t want you to
use me as an excuse when the IRS comes calling after you’ve messed
up your tax return. Well, I was just trying to be a good Christian, like
my pastor said.
You know I’m leading you down the primrose path. What I mean, of
course, is that we shouldn’t carry our accounting over into the world
of spiritual or personal relationships. Being good at math can make
you bad at love and friendship.
Listen again to what the Apostle Paul said about what God has done
for us in Christ Jesus: In Christ God was reconciling the world to
himself, NOT COUNTING their trespasses against them.
Not counting. Think about that. God is bad at math, too! Well, okay,
not really bad at it as much as choosing not to make it the basis of
God’s relationship to us. God cancelled our sin in Jesus Christ; God
forgave our debts. God decided that unconditional love is what
would be the foundation of our salvation, not the making up for our
sins.

Maxie Dunnam, a Methodist evangelist and former seminary
president, tells the story of a former Catholic nun named Mary
Levack, who now works for a Methodist church. She had a horrible
upbringing, as her father left her mother with 14 children when
Mary was just five years old. You can imagine her sense of
abandonment and the feelings of being unloved. So as a young
woman, she entered a convent. Here’s some of her own words about
what she learned.
“I entered the Convent for two reasons. One, I felt the Lord calling
me to a closer life with Him; and two, I was such a scrupulous
individual, and needed direction in the depths of my spirit because I
did not really understand what this closer walk with the Lord meant
for me; I was of the mind that I had to make up for my sins. And so,
as a teenager in the middle fifties faced with a time when it came
time to do something with my life, I was of the opinion that it would
be difficult for me to love one person to the exclusion of all others,
and marriage therefore seemed out of the question even though I
felt that was a stronger personal desire than going into the Convent,
but I needed to make up for my sins, and so, I thought God must be
calling me into the Convent. Two of my sisters had entered the
Convent before me, and I was definitely of a mind that I had to do
something to make up for my sins. And, having been let into the
Convent, I was blessed. I found the Lord in a most beautifully
intimate way. But I also found community life, and it was very
threatening, and five years later I ran away because it was too
difficult for me in the sense that I was in too much inner turmoil. I
was very closed-mouthed. I wasn’t really a person who shared what
was going on inside of her; I didn’t know you could do that and be
respected for it. So I left the Convent. Because I hadn’t been
counseled properly I went right into another depression and
thought, well, God, now I’ve really blown it—I’ve divorced the
Lord—and I’m never going to get to heaven. So I went back into my
wounded position and cried and wept and prayed, and felt that God
moved heaven and earth and Rome, and I was finally accepted back
into the Convent. And again I was blessed. This time I had a little
more help in finding out what was really the source of the problem.
""The word of the Lord came to me through a priest to whom I had
admitted having entered the Convent, among other reasons, for the
sake of making up for my sins. When he heard this, he literally wept. 
3
And then he said, Oh, my God, didn’t anyone ever tell you Jesus did
that? You don’t have to do that. You can't do that. Just receive His
forgiveness.1
Good work, Father.
Hear again what the good father told Mary. God made up for our sins
by not counting them against us. God made the sinless Son of God
take on our sins so that he could exchange his righteousness for our
sin.
This great exchange is what the word reconciliation means. It’s an
accounting term. It literally means “exchange.” Imagine walking into
a bank where you have an outstanding loan. You know and your
banker knows that it is a debt you cannot pay. Instead of taking your
car or your house, along with your dignity, in exchange for your
debt, your banker hands you the loan document that reads “paid in
full.” The bank has decided to reconcile your account in your favor.
Now, I doubt you’ll find many bankers eager to do that for you. And
though banks sometimes do write off bad debts on their own
financials, the debtors themselves have to live with the
consequences of their defaults. Sins are bad debts that we can never
pay off ourselves. They are faults that drive us into eternal default.
But instead God takes our sin into God’s own life and bears the cost
of it. God forgives our debts and reconciles our accounts.
All God asks us to do in return is to accept the new terms of our
relationship. Not to go our own way, but to be bound to God in love
as God has loved us. When we talk about being a Christian, this is
what we mean: we accept our forgiveness, and we live as foreverforgiven
sinners.
This is the essence of the Parable of the Prodigal Son that we read
earlier. The prodigal son is not the focus of the story. The loving
father is where all the attention should go. The father doesn’t hold
the son’s sin against him. He welcomes him home. He throws a party.
The father will not even wait to hear the son’s confession. The new
rule is that he only has to accept his acceptance by dropping his speech and coming inside.
But that example should lead us to go and do likewise. Paul says that
we should operate the same way with other people. We should be as
bad at accounting as God is.
This approach is just as hard for us as it was for the elder brother.
It’s hard for us to accept that God would treat us this way.
Everything about the world that Paul says is passing away in favor of
the world that God is bringing to pass says that if we are responsible
human beings, we have to be accountable for our actions. Here are
two other variations on that word again: accounting and
accountable. We may worry that God is taking away all
accountability and that the world will fall apart because people are
now irresponsible about their actions. But the world was already
falling apart because off the principle of having to account for sin.
Instead, God has made us accountable for forgiveness. We are still
accountable, but now it’s not for our sin, which is taken away; it’s for
our forgiveness, which lasts forever.
And the way we live into that forgiveness is to forgive others. The
way we prove that we are reconciled to God is by being reconciled to
one another. Paul says that his ministry and ours is to be
ambassadors of reconciliation. This is the call to Christians. We live
now according to the spirit, not according to the flesh. We live
according to the new accounting rules that God has written for us.
How do we do this? We don’t base our relationships to one another
on the unsettled accounts of our unsatisfied grievances. We don’t sit
around waiting for others to make up for their sins against us. We
take all the hurt and brokenness, all the pain that has been caused to
us, into ourselves. We take everything deep enough within us so that
Christ lives, and we give it all to him, since he is the one who alone
knows what to do with sin. We let it go. And then we seek to live
toward those who have sinned against us as if they haven’t sinned.
We look for ways to restore the relationships in love—as God has
done for us.
A community in the south part of Poland had a difficult decision to
make. It was 1921, a few short years after the devastation of World 
5
War I. A Quaker woman who was a nurse had tirelessly and
selflessly given herself to the people of that community, but her
death created a crisis. The people of that community had to decide
where to bury her. It was a Roman Catholic community, and the only
cemetery was the church cemetery. The rules of the church were
clear: only Catholics could be buried in those holy grounds, because
the church could be assured that only those who were baptized
Catholics had their sins forgiven. (Remember that it was 1921.) So
they did the only thing the rules said they could do. They buried her
just outside the cemetery.
This decision didn’t settle well with the people. They understood
that the institutional church had its rules about who was in and who
was out. Institutions tend to bend to the many and not the few. But
later that night the people of the community all got together under
the cloak of darkness and rewrote the rules, so to speak. They
moved the fence. And when morning broke, that precious Christian
woman’s grave was inside the cemetery.2
This is a picture of what it means to be ministers of reconciliation.
God has moved the fences for us in order to include us. We have
fellowship with God, not because of who we are or what we have
done, but because of who God is and what God has done. And then
we follow in kind. We look for ways to be in fellowship with one
another. And by the way, it’s all the sweeter when we do so with one
another while we and they are still alive.
This is the new math. And God is counting on us to learn it for
ourselves and live it with others. 
",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",3/6/2016,
"Our epistle reading today concludes with a familiar verse of Scripture
that you’ve probably quoted to yourself at some point when you’ve been
under great pressure. I know I’ve quoted it to myself—lately. We say it
to friends and loved ones who are going through hard times. But do we
really know what it means?
No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God is
faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but with
the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be able to
endure it.
The way we have normally interpreted this verse is to say, You can do it.
You aren’t going through anything, no matter what it is, that isn’t
common to human experience. What’s more, you have a secret weapon
in God: God will not let you break under it. If it ever gets too great for
you to handle, don’t worry— God will help you find a way out of it so
that you’ll be okay.
Let me say up front that I still think this is true. But it’s more
complicated than that, and more hopeful. So let’s unpack it together.
The first thing is that God is not to blame for bringing on the test. The
world is good enough at that job; God doesn’t need to pile on. When
someone gets tackled on the football field and after the whistle is blown
someone jumps on the ball carrier who is already flat on his face, the
referee throws a flag and penalizes the defense 15 yards for piling on.
We call it a personal foul. God doesn’t commit personal fouls. God
doesn’t pile on to our failure or fatigue. God is in the coaching role of
raising us up, dusting us off and giving us the strength to go on.
But the tests we face in life are not all bad in themselves. It doesn’t
matter what they are—in the hands of God who is at work in us, we can
find victory in them and through them.
Let me point out here that the word here for test can also be translated 
2
as trial or temptation, and that’s why Bible translators sometimes have
used one of those words or another. Context usually gives us a clue
about which way to read it. But the truth is that whether testing or
trying or tempting, it sometimes all feels the same to us. We face a
situation that we didn’t necessarily bring on ourselves any more than
God brought it on us. It is what it is, even if we hate that phrase because
we can’t come up with the cause for why it is what it is.
We all get nervous about tests. Think back to your school days. Or
maybe you’re still in your school days. We’re afraid of failing or doing
poorly. But the truth is that knowing that tests will come can motivate
us to be prepared for them. We can study. We can discipline ourselves in
order to be ready when those tests come.
Of course we can also be tempted to live as though the tests are
unimportant or won’t come. We may be tempted to do something more
fun than study or preparation. There’s plenty of that everywhere we
turn.
Look at what Paul is saying in context about this. Just before our passage
in chapter 10, he has talked about how he prepares himself. He says he
is like a runner who runs to win. He is like an athlete who trains his
body, exercising self-control and discipline so that he will not be
disqualified but can win the prize. But then he turns to the Corinthians
and says essentially that he doesn’t see in them this kind of spiritual
discipline.
The Corinthian church appears to have been happy to have received the
grace of Christ, to be delighted that they’ve been baptized, and to be
eager to share communion to reinforce their privilege as forgiven
sinners. God loves to forgive sins; they love to commit them. What a
great religion, don’t you know?!
Well, this is not the way Paul thinks of salvation. So Paul cleverly
retrofits this story back to Israel’s story to teach them a lesson. Israel
had been under more stress and trials during their slavery in Egypt than
they could bear. God provided a way out for them—an exodus. As they
were led out, they went through the sea—a symbol of baptism. Then
they walked through the wilderness under a cloud that guided them—a
symbol of God’s presence. They were fed by manna from heaven every
day and drank water that God gave to them when Moses struck a rock 
3
with his rod—a symbol of holy communion. And then Paul goes all
mystical on them and says that the rock was Christ.
The rabbis had said that as the people wandered in the wilderness, the
rock followed them. Paul says that that rolling stone that gathered no
moss was none other than Christ himself. Christ was the original Rolling
Stone! Paul thinks of Christ as being mysteriously present in the world,
even before Jesus was born. He thinks of God as being consistent in
giving help and hope from creation to consummation. Christ’s salvation
works backward as well as forward. An amazing thought.
So the Corinthian experience can be seen in the lessons of ancient
Israel—positively and negatively. And now he goes into the negative.
Unfortunately, after all God had done for Israel, and no matter how
much Christ was present with them to give them life, some were
unfaithful. They still wanted to live like their neighbors. They worshiped
other gods. They behaved immorally. They had sexual relations with the
Moabites and neglected the boundaries of separation given in the Ten
Commandments. The result was disastrous.
Corinth, an international seaport, was a place of enormous temptation.
The pagans worshiped many gods, and their worship practices included
temple prostitution. The Corinthian church was participating in just
such idolatry and immorality, even as they were claiming to be
Christians and eating at the table of the Lord.
Paul tells them that salvation includes the transformation of character
that demonstrates God’s presence. If you think you are standing, watch
out lest you fall.
Then he assures them that they can make it through these temptations
and tests. But it will take intention and effort.
Two things I want to point out about what he says. First, every time Paul
talks about you in this passage, the you is plural. We tend to think in
individual terms about everything. We wrench this passage out of
context and make it something we can read in a little book of Bible
promises that have no relationship to anyone but me. But that isn’t the
way we live as Christians.
For one thing, Paul is concerned about the church at Corinth, not just 
4
individual Christians who are going through temptations or tests. And
the church today will go through such tests. When we do, we should not
think of them as a sign of punishment for being unfaithful. Going though
tests is not a sign of God’s disfavor; it is an opportunity to discover God’s
faithfulness and to grow.
We are going through a test as a church ourselves today. As most of you
know, we are wrestling with the question of how we will be faithful to
the Lord and to Christians among us who experience same-sex
attraction. I myself am not wrestling with this issue in the way I did for
most of my ministry. I have come to understand that there are some
things I will never completely understand, but the one thing I am called
to do with perfect clarity is to act with perfect charity toward every
child of God for whom Christ died. And when I say charity, I mean by
that love and acceptance, not tolerance and pity.
Now, this is not a test that has come upon us by our own doing. It it
what it is. And we are depending upon God and each other to carry us
through it in a way that honors our deepest understanding of what it
means to be the people of God who are trying to be—as our vision
statement puts it—a bold witness to the way of Christ in our time.
The good news is that we all agree that we are to love all people,
including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people everywhere—
and to cherish them even more when they are fellow Christians in our
church. What we don’t all agree on is whether there should be limits to
the participation of LGBT Christians in the church. Whether ordaining
them as deacons and ministers, recognizing them fully as married
couples among us, or even whether they might be married by our
ministers here or elsewhere—these are the kinds of questions we are
struggling with, since many of us have only read the Bible and been
taught that any and all same-sex love is sinful. This is an honest and
difficult process of spiritual discernment for us, and none of us knows
yet what we will decide together—or when.
I will tell you that this is the most difficult issue I have ever been
through as a pastor—holding in my heart with equal love people at all
places on the spectrum. There are not just two sides to this issue.
Some days I have been taking too much of it onto myself, and I have
found myself failing the test. But just when I have been at my breaking 
5
point more than once, I have found God faithful, as promised. Staff
colleagues, residents, resident alumni, friends inside the church and
outside it, some of you—those who agree with my position and those
who disagree, mildly or strongly—have borne me up with your prayers
and presence. Thank you. This is what Paul means by the plural you. We
are there for each other.
The other thing is this: the way out—the exodus that God promises—is
usually a way through that we are able to endure. But the going through
will always be disorienting and painful. It’s only afterward, with the
experience of hindsight, that we will see it as God’s doing.
When Israel left Egypt through the sea and walked into an uncharted
future toward the Promised Land, they didn’t have an immediate
experience of joy. Their experience was hard. It sometimes made them
long for the way things used to be. They grumbled at Moses for making
them go through it. But Christ was the rock who was with them,
following behind them as they followed the new way to life that God
was leading them to.
When test pilot Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in 1947, no one
was sure that human beings should go there. We would be moving too
fast, beyond the bounds that God had established for us, some said. And
every time a pilot had approached the speed of sound—662 miles per
hour at an altitude of 40,000 feet—the X-1 Rocket plane would shake
and rattle so much that pilots thought it would break up into a million
pieces, and so they pulled back. But when Chuck Yeager felt the shaking
at its worst, he asked himself this question: What if it’s calm on the other
side? He pushed the throttle down, heard the sonic boom—and guess
what? It was calm on the other side. And think of this: none of our space
travel or recent discoveries of the secrets of the universe would have
been possible without that moment.
The way of escape that God provides is to go through trials by enduring
short-term pain for long-term gain. God is always faithful to help us pass
whatever tests come our way. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",2/28/2016,
"When I was a kid growing up in Staten Island, my parents took me to a
church that showed a film series by Francis Schaeffer. It followed his
book, How Should We Then Live? Schaeffer believed Western culture was
going off the rails and the church should be deployed to bring back all
that is good, true and beautiful before godless secularism ruined it
forever. As it turned out, Schaeffer, and his son Frankie, became
spiritual gurus to the culture warriors of a generation ago that have in
one way or another persisted in our politics until the present. Francis is
dead now, and his son—who now goes by Frank—is deeply contrite
about the role he played in all of that.
Yet the question of the book and the film series is a good one. How
should we then live? How should we live as Christians in the world? It’s
a question the first Christians were asking, too. And the answer the
Apostle Paul gives to the church at Philippi in our text today is a good
place to look for an answer. Paul tells the young Christians at Philippi to
look to him and others who live this way. Imitate them. Walk this way,
he says. And at the end of the text, he says again, stand firm in the Lord …
in this way. So what is this way he’s talking about?
Well, before we say more, let’s say what the language of WAY is all about
in Paul’s thinking. Judaism can be understood as a way of life that
honors God’s covenant with Israel. There are two sides of that:
haggadah and halakha. The haggadah is the story of the covenant that
shapes the self-understanding of Israel. When Jews gather at the family
table for the Passover seder, they follow a conversation pattern laid out
in what is called a haggadah. It’s the narrative of God’s deliverance of
the children of Israel from slavery in Egypt. It begins with a question
asked by the youngest person at the table: Why is this night different
from all other nights? Then the story is retold as they eat the meal that
was the last supper before leaving Egypt.
Stories shape our sense of who we are. Just think about what it means
for many of you to be Texans. I have my own story as a New Yorker. And
it includes Peter Minuit buying Manhattan Island from the Native 
2
Americans for 60 guilders and some trinkets. Does it surprise you that
dealmaker Donald Trump is a New Yorker? We like a good deal, don’t
you know?! Unfortunately, we like our deals one-sided in our favor. And
there’s the story of Texas independence: Remember the Alamo, the
Battle of San Jacinto, free at last. Well, similarly, Israel has a story of
becoming a distinct free people by means of the exodus.
But freedom from Egypt required a disciplined way of life that would
keep them free. Halakha is the means by which Jews walk in the way of
the Lord as free people. It includes the 613 commandments that form a
way of life. Halakha means a path to walk, or the way. This is the way to
live, Jews would say. Do these things. Walk this way.
So when Paul invites the Philippians to join in imitating him as he walks
this way, he is adopting language of tradition but putting a new spin on
it. Now it’s not just about keeping the law; it’s about following the way
of Christ. Paul believes Christ embodied the law and fulfilled it. He
brought heaven and earth together in such a way that if we follow in
Christ’s way, we will experience the salvation God has promised.
But following Christ is harder when he is no longer visibly present. So
we need others to guide us, those like Paul who have known the way of
Christ and are walking in it.
Matthew Broyles’s ordination council met on Wednesday night. The way
this works is that we gather a diverse group from the church and
usually one minister from outside the church to engage him in
conversation about his faith journey, his theological beliefs and his
sense of calling. Duke Divinity School professor, Curtis Freeman, sat in
with us and asked an interesting question: What do you say to someone
who asks how God changes us and makes us more like Christ? After listing
a few things, we all got involved and agreed that it isn’t an individual
process, even if each person must be intentional in taking spiritual
responsibility. It’s a community project. It takes a church! We join in
with others who are trying to follow in Christ’s way. We imitate each
other, and especially those whose lives have a sense of Christian
maturity about them. Then over time our way of walking becomes more
like theirs, even while each of us retain our own unique stride.

I spent the month of July last year in Italy while on sabbatical. One day I
decided to take a hike in the Apennine Mountains in western Italy. I
went by myself, confident that there were signs to guide me and
markings on trees and stones to keep me on the path. The route I chose
was supposed to be about a 2.5-hour hike, but along the way in a dense
part of a forest, I lost the trail. Maybe the fallen leaves obscured the
path; I don’t know. But I found myself lost and guessing which way to
go. I tried two or three different directions, going on my own instincts
and hoping to pick up the trail again. Each time I would have to give up
and return to the place where I first knew I was lost. To my great relief,
at long last I heard the sound of two other hikers coming my way. When
they arrived, they realized that the trail markers did in fact end. We
were all there together. But the difference between us was that they
were both from there. They were citizens of Italy and residents of that
region. They had hiked those mountains since they were boys. One man
spoke only Italian, the other, gratefully for me, also spoke English. The
man who spoke English finally looked at me and said, Don’t worry, just
follow us. Well, I did, and after taking a direction that seemed to go
straight up for an hour or so, we emerged in a high meadow and found a
sign that took them one way and me another. After hiking for about 8
long hours, I finally made it back to my car and breathed a sigh of relief.
Where would I have been without those men showing up? Lost. And
what would have become of me? I don’t know, and I’m not trying to be
dramatic about it, but I am hardly a survivalist by nature. It wouldn’t
have been good, let’s just say that.
Paul says that this is the problem many of us have in this world. We live
by our own instincts that have been formed only by our earthly
citizenship. We don’t know how to navigate a path through life that has
the perspective of heaven. We need good guides, presumably bilingual
guides, who speak the language of both heaven and earth.
The problem too many of us have is that we rely upon our natural
appetites to guide our actions. Paul says that those who are enemies of
the cross live in such a way that their end will be destruction. Their god
is the belly and their glory is in their shame. That is, they take their cues
from their human urges; self-denial and discipline are not part of their
spiritual vocabulary.

I talked with a man once who was having marital trouble because of
infidelity. He had been single for many years and had traveled a lot. He
got used to a certain way of life that didn’t comport with married life. He
told me that he always just thought of sex as one of the bodily functions
you obey when the desire arises. You eat, you drink, you void, and you
have sex. It’s just a natural way of being human.
The goal of the Christian life is to be fully human, as God has intended
for us. But being fully human is being more than animals that only obey
their urges without regard to higher covenant purposes.
The way of the cross is a hard way of living. It doesn’t seek only to fulfill
one’s natural instincts or personal agendas. It seeks a higher way of
living that includes concern for the well-being of others.
We had an example this week of the contrast between these two
approaches after the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Scalia was an American original. He was a colorful justice, a robust
personality. He could be personally charming and also professionally
combative. He loved a good debate and never shied away from it. After
his death, conservatives and liberals made him into either a pure saint
or an utter sinner for his role on the court. But something else was
revealed in the wake of his death that should instruct us. It seems he
had an incredible capacity for friendship, even with those he disagreed
with famously. His liberal colleague on the court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
called him her buddy. They shared a love for opera, and they and their
spouses spent New Year’s Eve together every year. Even in their work,
she said he always made her better. They were both citizens of the
United States, even if they saw things differently about what that meant.
But they each had a transcendent sense of what was important, and it
went beyond liberal and conservative politics to a friendship that was
above all that.
One of the things that encourages that kind of friendship is that all nine
justices are locked into a cohort for life. They have to live and work
together until they retire or die. And that allows them to rub off on each
other in ways that change each of them and all of them, hopefully for the
better. 
5
This is what we hope church will be for us. We are committed to one
another in a covenant of love that regards others as so valuable to us
that we treat them not only with respect, but also see them as gifts of
God to help guide us through life. I know this about myself: for the
better part of 27 years I have not only served you as your pastor but I
have also been served by you. I have been changed in all sorts of ways
because I didn’t have the chance ever to be myself apart from you.
In his council the other day, Matthew quoted the hymn that begins: We
are travelers on a journey, fellow pilgrims on the road. He noted the line
that goes: Brother, let me be your servant, let me be as Christ to you;/
pray that I may have the grace to let you be my servant, too. This is so
important: we grow in grace not just by serving, but by allowing
ourselves to be served.
This means that we know we are not there yet, any of us. It means we
need each other to make our way in the world until God says we are
finally finished products. We are lost without each other. And so for
now, we walk together in this way of Christ. Amen. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",2/21/2016,
"“Everything else in astronomy is like the eye,” one physicist said this
week, referring to the panoply of telescopes that have given stargazers
access to more and more of the electromagnetic spectrum and the
ability to peer deeper and deeper into space and time. “Finally,
astronomy grew ears. We never had ears before.”1
Astronomy grew ears, and last September it heard a word from far, far
away. Okay, not a word per se, but a sound, sort of, a digitally produced
chirp, as they call it. It was a like a word from way beyond us, from the
past, from a billion years ago.
Think of that for a moment. Science tells us that the universe is about
13.7 billion years old, the earth is about 4.5 billion years old, and the
beginnings of life on earth happened about 3.8 billion years ago—with
single-cell organisms being the whole of life until about 600 million
years ago. Human beings seem to have reached their distinctive identity
in this creative process about 200 million years ago, and recorded
human history goes back only about 10,000 years. So think about this:
the meaning of the world preceded us; it didn’t start with us.
God has been at work in far-off places for billions of years, and the
sounds of the universe were heard only by God. But those sounds travel
through space-time. And for the very first time we have heard the sound
of what Einstein imagined existed in his general theory of relativity a
hundred years ago but couldn’t prove at that time.
Humans have now heard the chirping sound of a space-time disturbance
called gravitational waves. Two black holes collided in space and
merged some 1.3 billion years ago. That collusion rippled through the
fabric of the universe. Think about dropping a rock into a pond—or
better, dropping a bowling bowl onto a trampoline. The disturbance has
been hurtling toward us at light speed all these years. And because we
now have ears that come from advanced listening devices, we have heard it at long last. The vast, silent universe has spoken to us to tell us
something about how things work, how reality is organized. Incredible.
The sound is near, near enough for us to hear at long last.
What does all this have to do with the first Sunday in Lent and our
Christian hope? More than you might think.
In our text today, the Apostle Paul is writing to the church at Rome,
which 2,000 years ago was composed of both Jews and Gentiles who
had put their faith in Jesus. There would have been no question among
these Jews that God had spoken to them. The word came near to them
when God delivered to them the law on Mt. Sinai in the form of the Ten
Words—or the Ten Commandments, as we call them. And what
followed that was the whole of the Torah, the law that interpreted those
Ten Words for use in the everyday life of the people.
At its heart, the giving of the law to Israel was God’s way of reaching out
to the world and giving us ears to hear that we are not alone. We are not
mere accidents that evolution has brought to pass. We are not a lonely
planet, fourth rock from the sun, that somehow developed life forms
that could eventually be conscious of their existence, but for no
apparent purpose than just to live for a time and then die. We were
meant to be. God meant us to be. By God’s creative word, we came to be.
And the stories of our coming to be in Genesis, along with the rest of the
universe, are meant to tell us that, too. Not how long it took or by what
process of development, but by Whom, first of all. By God.
And the fact that we came to be by God’s speaking us into being is the
Bible’s way of saying that God wanted to be known by us in return. God
gave us ears to hear so that we would be at home in the world and know
that we have a Creator in whose image and likeness we are made. This is
such an extraordinary thing the Bible tells us that we can hardly get our
heads around it.
When Paul says that the word is near, he is quoting from the Book of
Deuteronomy. In this passage, Moses understands that although God
came near to Israel through the word so that they could hear it and live
by it, they would nevertheless fail time and again and suffer the
consequences. God gave the law to the Israelites so that they would 
3
know that just as the world is set up in a certain way, so we are set up in
a certain way. There is a right way to live and a wrong way. The law was
Israel’s guide to prosperity and goodness.
Failing to heed the law would have devastating effects. It would be like
jumping off a building because you can, but the law of gravity would
have an effect on you, and you would suffer the consequences. God gave
the Israelites the law for their own good, because God wanted a witness
to the world about what God’s good intentions are for us.
But we know that Israel was not content to keep the word that had
come near to their lips. It was on their lips, but it had not sunk into their
hearts. So God would make a new start. God would write the word on
their hearts so that they could know it and live.
What Paul is saying is that Jesus is the fulfillment of the law. He himself
is the word. The world was made in and through him, as he came from
heaven at long last to be God among us, to be the word that is near us.
Now all the world—not just Israel, but all the world—everyone, Jew and
Gentile alike, can have access to this word by faith in Jesus. Jesus is Lord
of all. He is Lord of Israel. He is Lord of the universe. He is God with us.
He is the sound of creation that gives meaning to everything.
In the verses in Romans that precede these, Paul again paraphrases
Deuteronomy: Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend to heaven?’
(that is, to bring Christ down) or ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ (that
is, to bring Christ up from the dead). What does it say? ‘The word is near
you, on your lips and in your heart’ (that is, the word of faith that we
proclaim).
In other words, we do not have to grow ears by building listening
devices that reach into deepest outer space to hear the word that God is
speaking to us. God has sent that word to us in Christ Jesus so that we
could all hear it. The word is near now. And we do not need to go into
the depths of the sea—by which he means to the abode of the dead—in
order to hear it. God has sent Jesus to the abyss by his death and raised
him up in order that we could hear it. The word is near now. God has
done the heavy lifting for us. God has come near to us in Christ Jesus. He
is Lord of all. 
4
So whether Jew or Gentile, we now all have access to the word of God.
And because it is not only on our lips but in our hearts, we can answer in
response by faith. We can proclaim with our lips that Jesus is Lord, and
we can believe in our hearts that God has raised him from the dead. This
is what gives any of us and all of us membership in the church and the
hope of salvation at the end time.
Today is Valentine’s Day, my wife’s least favorite holiday, don’t you
know?! She discounts any Hallmark manipulation that tells me I’m
supposed to tell her I love her. Kim’s reservations aside, you may have
someone give you the word today that you are loved. Accepting that
word and trusting it will make you vulnerable. You may be afraid that if
you believe it, even though it has come near to you, it will expose you to
shame. You will be disappointed. You will feel foolish that you trusted
someone who said I love you, because maybe you’ve done that before
and been hurt. Maybe you’ve built up a wall around your heart that is
meant to protect you from pain. But you will know the joy of love only if
you open yourself to it. Only if you accept the word that has come near
to you will you feel the love that saves and heals.
I think I must have seen it in The New Yorker magazine, where all the
greatest cartoons seem to be. It’s a picture of an apartment. Someone
has slid a Valentine heart under the door. Inside the room, by the
window, you can see the figure of a person hiding behind the drapes. It’s
as if the word is too good to be true. And yet it has come near.
This is what Paul is saying to us about God. Open your heart in faith. Let
yourself be loved. Come out of your fear and your hiding. Trust. Trust in
God’s word, who is Jesus Christ.
It’s for you, no matter who you are, no matter what you have done or
failed to do. Jew and Gentile alike—there is no distinction. God wants
you. God wants us all. So we have to stop making differences between
ourselves, too. We have to look upon each other as sisters and brothers
in Christ. The only thing that defines our membership in the people of
God is our confession that Jesus is Lord.
Something remarkable happened this week in, of all places, that island 
5
of atheism, Cuba. Pope Francis and the Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill
met. Their meeting began an ending to a division that stretched back to
the separation of the church into East and West in the year 1054. For
the first time in nearly a thousand years, the church came together, even
if only symbolically. Everything that has separated the church is not
forgotten, but this is the first step. These two leaders came near to one
another.
We are brothers, Pope Francis said to his counterpart. Now things are
easier, replied Patriarch Kirill. This is the will of God.2
And indeed it is. It is the will of God that all who come to faith in
Christ—all who say with their lips that Jesus is Lord and believe in their
hearts that God raised him from the dead—should be brothers and
sisters. Nothing should separate what God has called together.
And this is because God has done for the whole world what these men
did with each other. God came near. The Word is near. Now we can all
be one with God. Now we can all be saved.
The proof is not just the assurance that we have in our hearts
individually, though; the proof is that we look upon others who confess
Jesus as Lord and say, We are brothers. We are sisters. This is the will of
God. We do not put anything else in the way of this truth. We do not look
to our differences, no matter how great. We look to our common
confession of Jesus as Lord.
And that—that is finally enough. 
",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",2/14/2016,
"“I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of
three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday
you'll understand that.”
These are the words of Rick Blaine in the film Casablanca. Rick utters these words
on a rain-slicked tarmac at a small Moroccan airport.
It’s the climax of the film and Rick who is played by Humphrey Bogart directs
them towards his old love Ilsa Lund.
Rick is helping Ilsa and her husband escape to Portugal where they will be safe
from the Germans who have occupied Casablanca.
And as Rick says his goodbye, Ilsa’s lips begin to quiver and her eyes, like glass,
begin to glisten with tears.
The gravity of a hard goodbye has set in and her head hangs.
And Rick, in this moment, reaches out and touches the face of the woman that he
loves and draws her back saying… “Now, now... Here's looking at you kid.”
One of the hardest things about life is learning how to say goodbye.
Whether it’s a friend moving away, a change in career, a child going to college, a
pet passing, or the loss of a loved one.
It’s just so hard to say goodbye.
And this is partially why Peter says and does such peculiar things up on that
mountain in Luke’s gospel.
On that mountain, Peter comes to grips with a hard goodbye even while he looks
the beauty of the moment in its teeth.
Luke tells the story this way… 
 2
Jesus took with him Peter, James and John up on a mountain to pray. And while
Jesus was praying, the appearance of his face began to change and his clothes
became dazzling white.
Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to Jesus. They appeared in
glory and were speaking of Jesus’s departure, which he was about to accomplish at
Jerusalem. But Peter and the disciples woke up and they saw Jesus in glory.
And just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus: “Master, it is good for us to
be here. Let us make three dwellings: one for you, one for Moses and one for
Elijah.”
Then a mighty cloud came and it overshadowed them. And they were terrified.
From the cloud came a voice, “This is my son, my chosen, listen to him!”
Now many people like to throw Peter under the bus in Luke’s Gospel. Peter comes
off looking a little silly and Luke certainly highlights his lack of understanding to
his readers.
As a narrator, Luke uses a delicate touch to indicate that Peter didn’t “know what
he was talking about.”
And yet, I have some sympathy for Peter, and maybe you will too.
Peter is like us. He struggles to come to grips with the reality of departures. He
struggles with imminent goodbyes.
Like a cloud, the theme of departure hangs over this story, casting its shadow over
the ninth chapter of Luke. And by the chapter’s end, Luke writes that Jesus has set
his face to go to Jerusalem which is where he will suffer and die.
Just before Peter, James and John go up on that mountain, Jesus tells Peter and the
disciples some discouraging news. He tells them “the Son of Man must undergo
great suffering and be rejected by the elders, and the Chief Priests and be killed.”
And Peter hears this before he goes up on the mountain to pray.
So it is no wonder why Peter, up on that mountain with those words fresh in his
mind, says “let’s stay here. It’s good for us to be here. I can build some dwellings.
Let’s stay longer.” 
 3
Isn’t it just so hard to let go?
Relationships are like monarch butterflies. When you are lucky to find them, you
have to hold them lightly. If you hold onto relationships too tightly, you will crush
them.

Hold them lightly.
It is counter intuitive, I know,
But in time you’ll find
That it is right to let them go.
And yet these words will strike many as incomprehensible.
Like Peter on the mountain, those who face significant departures find themselves
left standing there “overshadowed by a cloud.”
And isn’t this the challenge with letting go of anything?
For those in the shadow of letting go, tomorrow becomes a cloud that you cannot
see through.
And like Peter, it is terrifying to enter into it.
But could there ever be a breakthrough in the clouds?
Could there ever be a release?
Could there ever be a loosening of a grip and healing?
Jackson Landers, a writer for the New York Times, found himself in an unenviable
position. He was lying on his back, his teeth were clenched and his hands were
gripping the sides of a hospital bed.
His knuckles were about as white as the lab coats from the medical staff which
swirled around his bed. And the pain from his stomach cramps crept up towards his
heart.
Six hours earlier, Jackson decided to go fishing at his favorite fishing hole near his
home in Virginia. He grabbed his fishing tackle and his shoes off of his front
porch. 
 4
Jackson put his shoes on and began to walk down to the lake. He made it about a
dozen steps before he started to feel a stinging sensation on the second toe of his
left foot.
As he kept walking to the lake, the pain began to increase.
So Jackson sat down on a rock, took his shoe off and looked at his foot. He found
two little puncture wounds in his toe.
And then he saw the squashed remains of a black widow spider smeared across the
insole of his shoe.
For a long moment, Jackson stared at his throbbing toe and wondered what to do.
Eventually Jackson decided what to do. He picked up his belongings and went
fishing.
Three catfish later, the symptoms were progressing.
Jackson said he “felt a warmth in his abdomen.” And this warmth turned into
pressure which became a painful cramping.” There could be no more denial.
He carried his fish up the hill to his car and headed for the hospital in
Charlottesville.
And that’s how Jackson found himself lying there on his back with his teeth
clenched and his hands gripping the sides of the hospital bed.
The pain had crept into his chest which was sending out waves of muscle spasms.
His biceps twitched and he shivered uncontrollably.
At midnight, the mysterious antivenom was ready. It had been six hours since he
was bitten. The room was crowded with doctors, nurses and medical students.
One medical resident wisecracked, “you don’t look so good, do you?”
And Jackson said, “you should see the other guy.” 
 5
The doctor injected the antivenom. Jackson began to feel a warm sensation in his
upper arm. What followed was, what he described as “the kind of rush that comes
from a recreational drug.” He said, “a wonderful warm flow spread from my left
arm into my chest, then my abdomen.”
As time went by, Jackson’s grip loosened, his spasms subsided and his hands
relaxed.
For those in a cloud of loss, could there ever be a loosening of a grip? Could there
ever be healing?
Luke in his Gospel says that Peter saw Moses and Elijah who appeared in glory
speaking with Jesus about “his departure which he was about to accomplish in
Jerusalem.”
His departure.
Now Luke is clearly speaking about the impending death and resurrection of Jesus.
Scholars like to point out that the Greek word for departure that Luke uses here to
describe the work of Jesus is the Greek word exodon.
Exodon is the same root word that is used to title the book of the Exodus.
Exodus, if you don’t remember, is the title of the great book of the Bible that tells
the story of the Hebrews leaving the slave pits of Egypt.
The exodus is a story of deliverance… of release.
And Luke uses this word exodon, or departure, to describe the redemptive work of
Christ that will be accomplished in Jerusalem.
Just like in the book of Exodus, God is once again delivering his people out of sin
and bondage and creating a new people.
This is how so many of the gospel writers understood the work of Christ.
For Luke it wasn’t just that Jesus died on the cross so that people could go to
heaven; there was something even deeper at work. 
 6
In Jesus, Luke saw a new exodus unfolding. He saw that God was once again
delivering his people out of sin and bondage and decay and creating new
communities. He saw liberation, a great letting go.
All of the gospel writers go out of their way to note that Jesus was crucified on or
around the Jewish festival of Passover.
Passover. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John timestamp the death of Jesus, not on the
day of atonement, but on the festival of Passover which commemorated God’s
deliverance of the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt.
So maybe we shouldn’t be surprised to find that Luke refers to the work of God,
during the Transfiguration, as a departure.
It’s a deliverance, an exodon, a release.
Like in the exodus of old…. it’s when people are leaving that we are witnessing
the saving power of God.
Perhaps there is no better illustration of this irony than a work by the modernist
painter Marc Chagall.
In 1966, Marc Chagall completed a surrealist painting titled Exodus.
In his work Chagall, a Jew, depicts a multitude of people fleeing Egypt during the
exodus behind Moses.
In his painting, mothers walk through the darkness with nursing babies. Men walk
carrying all they can.
And Marc Chagall paints the crucified Christ hanging there above the multitude
fleeing Egypt.
It’s the exodus.
It is in the act of leaving that Christ begins to do something new.
Like the exodus of old when the clouds crowd in.
It’s when people are leaving, that we are witnessing the saving power of God. 
 7
What if you were to look at those who were leaving, as people who were being
delivered into the hands of God.
What if you could see loss as God’s gain?
It’s sad to be sure.
But what if you could see your tears transfigured?
What if there was healing for our deepest losses?
At the foot of the mountain we find a man who meets Jesus. And he rushes up to
him and he begs him, “Teacher, Teacher. I beg you to look at my son. He is my
only child. My son. He shrieks and convulses, his muscles spasm and he foams at
the mouth. Teacher, I beg you, come look at my son.”
Luke includes this story of healing right after the Transfiguration. And perhaps he
does this because of their combined beauty.
Don’t you see?
The one up on the mountain who is looked at in glory, he is the same one who
comes down, and looks at those who are suffering.
Don’t you see?
The good Lord who is looked at in glory on the mountain is the same one who
comes down and looks at those who are hurting.
“Here’s looking at you kid.”
Here’s looking at you. Amen.",Josh Thiering,"Dallas, TX",2/7/2016,
"In my humble opinion, this is the most beautiful chapter in the
Bible. Especially the way it reads in the good old King James
Version. But it’s so lovely even our modern translations can’t ruin
it altogether. First Corinthians 13, or if you’re so inclined, One
Corinthians 13.
I have preached on this chapter more than any other in the whole
of holy scripture. Can you guess why? My being a hopeless
romantic is only part of it. The other part is that it’s the most
frequently chosen passage for weddings. I figure I’ve done
hundreds of those over the years.
Now, most couples who are getting married aren’t Bible scholars.
They figure you can just go to the Bible and look up weddings in
the index and presto, there it is—a list of passages. Lots of people
think of the Bible that way, as if it’s an encyclopedia of topics that
address every possible issue we will ever deal with and answer
every question we might have. Not so. It’s a love story of God’s
romance of the world, and like any good love story it has
surprising twists and even wrong turns, and we’re supposed to
work out the meaning of it along the way even as we are still
walking the way since the end has not yet come when we will
have perfect understanding of it all. Well, that’s actually getting to
Paul’s last point a little early: now we know in part, then—that is,
at the end—we shall know in full.
This chapter works for weddings because it works for all
relationships. If we take it in, marriages, friendships, sibling and
neighbor relations, politics, work and school relationships, you
name it, will all be better. Yet, we shouldn’t miss that its original
context is one particular church that needed to hear about love.
When you read the Bible, you are reading someone else’s mail.
Paul didn’t know he was writing scripture. It just turns out that
churches other than the one in Corinth have been blessed by
hearing it as if it were addressed to them. To us, I mean. To all
churches across the years. And so much so that we came to hear it 
2
as God’s word to us as much as Paul’s word to Corinth.
So what does Paul say about love in the church that we so need to
hear? The first thing is that it is incomparable and indispensable.
Corinth was, like all of the early churches and ours too, a Spirit
community. It isn’t a group of likeminded people who join a book
club—in this case the Bible—and gather once a week to talk about
it over coffee and donuts. It’s a community of people who have
been inspired beyond reason. Being rooted in the Spirit, we are
somewhat eccentrics to the world and even ourselves, although
that also makes us more ourselves than we ever thought possible.
Now here’s always the problem in the church: when you
experience something as powerful as that that changes your life,
you suddenly or subtly start paying more attention to your own
experience than to the person next to you in the pew. And that
self-centeredness rather than other-centeredness is the opposite
of love.
Love is the essence of Christianity. It is relational in two
directions—with God and with others. It’s the bonding agent that
holds us together. Nothing compares to its importance to the
church, and we are nothing of importance as a church without it.
So Paul wants to tell them to get off their high horses and love
each other, but he is—unusually for him—tactful. He says, If I this
or that. It does apply to him too, but he means it to apply to them.
So, I’ll bite. I’ll do the same today, as long as you agree that this is
about you too. Deal?
So, if I speak with the tongues of men and angels but have not
love, I am a nothing but brash brass in the junior high band.
Everyone can hear me, but the music is lost in the noise. I call
attention to myself, and the band is the worse for it. Same with
knowledge. Now, I do hate this one. If I’m smart and know all the
answers, but don’t love you when you are wrong and disagree
with me—which is always the same thing, don’t you know?!—
then what good is that? I can be the church of George all by myself,
but we can’t be the church of Jesus Christ together. Finally, if I give
a lot of money to charity or work myself to death in service of the

Lord but I don’t love those I give to or serve as much as I love
them knowing how generous and sacrificial I am, well, what good
is that? I get to feel people’s praise now, and I may feel like my
giving or my service grants me some entitlement in the church,
but hey, hello, we’ll all be perfectly equal again one day in the
cemetery.
I hope you got the message, all of you who needed that … along
with me.
Now here’s the best part of the chapter that we usually hear at
weddings—the part that describes love as what you do and don’t
do. To paraphrase Forrest Gump, Love is as love does. Love’s not a
chemical you can break down in test tube and analyze its
properties; love is a way of living in relation to others that you see
in action. So, love is patient; love is kind love is not envious or
boastful or arrogant or rude. Now we go to what it isn’t: love does
not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not
rejoice in wrongdoing, but rejoices in the truth. Now to the positive
again: love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
endures all things.
Father Michael Renninger is the pastor of St. Mary’s Catholic
Church in Richmond, Virginia. He tells the story of being a college
student and on his way home one weekend when he stopped to
visit his grandparents. They were still in the same row house in
Philadelphia they had lived in during his growing up years. In
retirement his grandmother had become a bingo queen and his
grandfather had bought himself a leather recliner and a big screen
TV to watch the Phillies’ baseball games on. All that came to a
screeching halt when his grandfather had a series of strokes that
left him paralyzed on one side and unable to talk or swallow. The
doctors advised a nursing home, but being old-school his
grandmother determined to take care of him herself. So they
swapped a hospital bed for the recliner and inserted a feeding
tube.
Michael parked his car, walked across the front porch that day
and opened the squeaky front door, only to see that something
was very wrong. The green goop that was his liquid food was all
over him, his face was red, and he was waving his one good hand.

His grandmother was doing her best to tend to him when she
realized Michael had entered the house. Michael was spooked and
started to turn to leave, when she said to him in a stern voice he
had never heard from her: Don’t you dare. Don’t you dare leave.
Sometimes this is what love looks like.1
Sometimes this is what love looks like. Love is as love does. It isn’t
always pretty, but it’s always about acting on behalf of the one you
love.
Which is what I tell couples getting married. It will never again be
as easy to love your partner as on the day you say I do. But from
the day you say I do, love is what you do.
And that includes loving those you are not close to you too. In a
memorable phrase, theologian Cornel West said justice is what
love looks like in public. In our mostly wealthy, mostly white,
mostly Evangelical churches, we are moved and touched by
stories of love and duty that address how we treat our loved ones,
like the story I just told. Preachers are safe when they keep to
that. But we all have a spiritual public duty to look after one
another’s interests as well. The church should be the conscience of
the community. And frankly, sometimes business owners fail to
protect customers and politicians fail to serve their constituents
because it would either cost them money or cost them
embarrassment.
In Flint, Michigan right now there’s a scandal over leadcontaminated
drinking water from the Flint River. Two years ago
officials switched the water supply from Lake Huron through
Detroit to the Flint River in order to save money until a new water
delivery system would be finished in a couple of years. But almost
immediately residents began to complain about the smell and
color and taste of the water. It seems the Flint River water has
eight times the amount of chlorine in it that is acceptable. It
needed an anticorrosive agent to be added, but it wasn’t. And the
result was that the water leeched the lead in the pipes and made it
toxic by the time it reached the faucet of homes. Government officials, it turns out, tested the water, and even after knowing it
had high levels of lead that could cause all kinds of illness to the
citizens, they claimed it was safe. And all the while they claiming it
was safe, they were providing bottled drinking water to
government employees at their offices.
Seeking justice is not a cold and sterile secular exercise that
people of faith should leave to the marketplace or the government
to work out on their own since it has no spiritual implication.
Christian involvement in the world is an act of love. When we act
on behalf of those without a voice because they have little social
capital, we are loving our neighbors as Jesus called us to do. And
that’s why we preach and practice a whole gospel; not a gospel
with a hole in it.
The last thing Paul says is that love is enduring and never fails.
The incomparable and indispensable love that acts on behalf of
others and not out of self-interest is something that will go on
even into eternity.
Paul talks about maturity, and how when we were children we
spoke and reasoned like children, but when we became grown ups
we put away childish things. And that includes thinking that the
world is black and white, that there are simple answers to every
question and demanding that everyone live down to that
standard.
It strikes me that we do this especially in matters of faith. In all
other areas of life, we value and celebrate complexity and new
knowledge. We want our scientists to go beyond what is already
known. We want our engineers to utilize the best materials and
technologies in construction. We want our military to be equipped
with the best information and weaponry to keep us safe. But in
religion, we don’t want to think critically and to reach for the
depths of the mysteries of God and human life. How can we love
God and our neighbor with all our mind if we think everything
spiritual we need to know we learned in kindergarten?
And yet, even if we do, Paul says, we will still never know all there
is to know, because the nature of knowledge is that it is always
partial. Until we see God face to face, we have to exercise humility 
6
with one another. The one thing we will never outgrow is love.
Love drives us deeper into intimacy with God and one another,
and that will go on into infinity.
Faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these
is love.

"Let’s see now: we have Jesus’ miracle of turning water into wine,
we have Paul telling us about spiritual gifts, we have Martin
Luther King, Jr.’s, birthday weekend, and we have deacon
ordination. Okay, game on, challenge accepted.
Let’s begin here. Jesus himself is the gift that makes all the
difference in our lives. When Jesus is present in any situation—no
matter how dire, no matter how embarrassing, no matter how
hopeless— unthinkable things become possible.
Right at the beginning of Jesus’ ministry, he goes to a wedding in
the small village of Cana, which is about 6 miles from his
hometown of Nazareth. He’s just been baptized by John in the
Jordan River, south of Galilee in Judea. It is the event that signals
the beginning of his public ministry. As he heads back home, he
starts to call his disciples. He’s probably thinking about a strategic
plan—teaching maybe first. But before any of this can happen, he
goes to a wedding feast in Cana. A crisis arises at some time
during the feast, which may have lasted up to seven days. The
wine is running out.
This would have been a huge humiliation to the bride’s father. It
wouldn’t only have meant that he hadn’t prepared well enough for
the guests; it would have been a bad omen for the couple. The
wine running out may have made people wonder about the
couple’s future—whether the marriage would last if the wine
didn’t.
Having just thrown a wedding reception for my youngest
daughter, Jillian, last fall, I sympathize with the father of the bride
in this story. So much of the planning of these things involves the
hope that there will be enough of everything for the guests. The
parents worry about running out of food and drink. In our case,
my wife, Kim, always thinks that the guests will need less, and I
think we need to have more. Anyway, you may not think that such 
2
a problem will reflect on whether the couple will have a successful
marriage, because the whole idea is to celebrate fullness or
abundance.
John has just told us in chapter 1 that “the fullness of the godhead
was pleased to dwell in Jesus himself.” So wherever Jesus is, there
is always enough, there is more than enough, and the best is
always yet to come.
Jesus’ mother sees what is happening, and somehow she knows
enough about her son to think he has the power to do something
about it. Mothers know things about their sons that other people
don’t, don’t you know?! Does it sound like I have a mother?
Anyway, she tells Jesus to do something about it, and he hesitates
because he says his hour is not yet come. That’s code language in
John’s Gospel for the hour of Jesus’ final revelation to the world as
the messiah at the time of his death. It’s a way of talking about the
beginning of the age to come, when none of these
embarrassments will happen because God will be all in all, and
when everything God intends for human life will come to pass at
last.
Jesus consents to perform this miracle, thus immediately
thrusting himself into the limelight as the possible messiah. He
tells them to fill the large jars that are standing empty—the jars
that would be used for ritual washing to make people pure for the
Sabbath. This is another sign that we are dealing with a miracle
that foretells the new age, which is sometimes described as the
marriage feast of the lamb. When the water is turned into wine,
there is a sense that Jesus is not only offering a short-term fix for a
social faux pas; he is tipping his hand that he himself is the key to
the world as it will one day be.
So what are we to make of this event?
Years ago, when Johnny Carson was the host of The Tonight Show,
he interviewed an 8-year-old boy. The child was asked to appear
because he had rescued two friends in a coalmine outside his
hometown in West Virginia. As Johnny questioned the boy, it
became apparent that the young man was a Christian. So Johnny
asked him whether he attended Sunday school. When the boy said 
3
he did, Johnny inquired, What are you learning in Sunday school?
“Last week,” the boy said, “our lesson was about when Jesus went
to a wedding and turned water into wine.” The audience roared,
but Johnny tried to keep a straight face. Then he said, And what
did you learn from that story? The boy squirmed in his chair. It was
apparent that he hadn’t thought about this. But then he lifted his
face and said, “If you’re going to have a wedding, make sure you
invite Jesus!”1
Exactly. And just so we’re clear about this, Jesus is invited to any
wedding we have here at Wilshire and any wedding we will ever
have. Jesus himself is the gift at any Christian wedding that brings
joy, and he comes with the promise that points beyond the couple
to the marriage-like union of God with the world. Christian
weddings do that. They are not just a celebration of a couple being
married; they are signs of God’s everlasting love.
The civil rights movement that began to address the deep
divisions in our society between black and white Americans made
a great step forward when Martin Luther King, Jr., stepped onto
the stage of history. His “I have a dream” speech was laced with
biblical imagery. The power of that speech continues to capture
our imagination and fuels our desire for true equality. But it came
from a Christian preacher. We would never have been able to
make the progress we have, and we will never finish this work, if
all we do is appeal to social or political ideals of equality. We need
Jesus. He is the key. When and where he is present, we are able to
envision a world of fullness and not a world in which we are
competing for limited resources. We are able to imagine blacks
and whites enjoying the same quality of education, the same
opportunity to flourish in the workplace, the same possibilities of
life without the human distinctions of color that divide us. When
Jesus is present in our work, we are able to imagine a common
good that no laws can accomplish.
Two weeks ago I was with my grandchildren at Disneyworld,
where we saw a musical drama about dreams coming true, which
the Disney characters presented in front of the big castle. Into all this optimism comes the evil Maleficent, who scorns dreams and
tells them that the world is only a nightmare. Mickey Mouse
enters again to ask the children to help him by going deep into
their hearts and believing that dreams do come true. When
enough of us truly believe, it will happen. And of course all the
children promise to believe, and Maleficent is driven away.
That’s all the world has to offer, and we know it isn’t enough. Only
if God is present, and only if it is God’s dream for the world, can
we have such hope. And Jesus is the presence of God that makes
things possible that wishing can never bring about.
When we get to 1 Corinthians, where Paul talks about spiritual
gifts, he begins with the Gift first of all. It’s the gift of Jesus’ Spirit
that is given to us. Because Jesus has been raised from the dead
and gives us his Spirit, he can continue to show up in our world to
make God’s dream come true.
The first thing Paul says is that the Holy Spirit enables us to
believe. No one can say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit.
That’s shorthand for the truth that no one can truly be a believer
in Jesus just by wishing it. We have to be empowered by God to
believe. And Paul’s point is that anyone who can say Jesus is Lord,
ipso facto, has the Spirit. When we baptize anyone at Wilshire,
that’s what the person says—Jesus is Lord. We ask no other
questions to validate their faith. If the person confesses Christ, the
Spirit has enabled him or her, and Jesus is present. Faith in Jesus is
the gift of Jesus first of all.
But the Spirit also gives gifts along with the Gift. Paul talks about
the many gifts of the Spirit that are given to the church, and he
doesn’t mean to mention them all. In this case he only means to
illustrate that the more-sensational gifts—like speaking in
tongues—are not the only measure of Spirit giftedness.
The so-called charismatic movement had blown through a certain
St. Mary’s Church, and everyone, it seemed, was caught up in it—
except Maria Sanchez. People were speaking in tongues and
prophesying. They were full of joy and wanted everyone to
experience it with them. But Maria felt left out. She had no such
experience of the Spirit. People were praying that she would, but 
5
it didn’t happen.
Finally, Maria’s aunt came to visit her one day. Maria knew her
Aunt Carmen to be a woman of great faith. Maria told her aunt of
her experiences with her spiritual friends and of her own despair
over God's lack of presence in her life. Aunt Carmen heard Maria’s
story of pain and replied with great wisdom. The Holy Spirit has
been at work in your life ever since you were baptized, Aunt Carmen
told her. It is the Spirit that has taught you to have faith in Jesus. It
is the Spirit that has given you your many gifts for the common
good of God’s people. The Holy Spirit doesn’t have a copy machine.
Only you have been given the gifts that you have. The Spirit doesn’t
want you to be like anyone else. The Spirit gives each one of us a
different assortment of gifts. Our spiritual task is to use the gifts the
Spirit gives us for the common good.2
I love the phrase The Holy Spirit doesn’t have a copy machine.
There is one Spirit, there are different gifts, and there is one
common good. That’s the formula. One gift of Jesus, many gifts of
the Spirit, one good for all the church.
You deacons who are being ordained today do not have the same
gifts to bring to the deacon body as every other deacon. We don’t
need a bunch of copy- machine Christians. The uniqueness that
each of you brings will enrich us. Each of you only has to be
yourself as God has made you. But you are to use your gifts for the
common good.
Deacons are especially charged with being examples to the whole
church of what is expected of every Christian in the church. We
ask you to do your ministry according to the different gifts given
by the one Spirit. And doing your ministry will always involve
what is good for everyone. We go from one to many and back to
one again.
By the way, the oneness of the church is not uniformity, any more
than each gift is the same. We will think differently about this
matter or that from time to time, but those differences do not divide us. Instead they sharpen us; they make our unity all the
more remarkable.
During this election year, it seems we are hearing a lot about our
differences from one another. I think we are all yearning to hear
more about who will make us one people out of many. I wonder
whether the church isn’t the laboratory that America needs in
order to see how that is done.
",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",1/17/2016,
"The TV series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation concluded last fall
after a remarkable 15-year run. If you fear you’ll miss it, not to
worry; in addition to the immortality of reruns of that show and
its sister shows, CSI: Miami and CSI: New York, you still have other
related or similar shows to watch, including CSI: Cyber, NCIS, NCIS:
Los Angeles and NCIS: New Orleans. But the original cast drove off
into the sunset, literally and figuratively, in a lovely finale of love.
The show’s premise was that people who are killed and those who
kill them are often unknown. Yet they all leave traces of who they
are in various ways. The CSI agents follow the evidence to identify
them and in a strange way to bring them to life or to light. The
theme song of the show is Who Are You? Fitting.
And that’s the question we all ask ourselves sooner or later, and at
the beginning of this year, there’s no better time to ask it. WHO
are you? Who are YOU?
In different ways our biblical texts today all point to one way to
answer that: We are whom we love and who loves us.
I wonder whether George Bell would agree. In a heart-rending
feature article in The New York Times last fall, N.R. Kleinfield told
of the lonely death of George Bell. He was one of the roughly
50,000 who die yearly in New York City. But as the writer put it: A
much tinier number die alone in unwatched struggles. No one
collects their bodies. No one mourns the conclusion of a life. They
are just a name added to the death tables. In the year 2014, George
Bell, age 72, was among those names.
George Bell—a simple name, two syllables, the minimum. There
were no obvious answers as to who he was or what shape his life
had taken, what worries weighed on him, whom he loved and who
loved him.
There it is again: whom he loved and who loved him. 
 2
George Bell died without anyone knowing it, until the stench of his
decomposing body in his apartment made neighbors take notice.
They didn’t know the man who lived in apartment 23. They just
saw someone come and go.
When someone like George Bell dies, the city has a department of
public administrators who go into action to track down loved
ones, or barring that, just people who might have known him. In
the case of George Bell, the investigation proved fruitless. He had
lived a reclusive life. He was a hoarder. His apartment reeked of
death, as if it beckoned him finally to add his smell to it. He was
inurned in a paupers’ cemetery, the military even rejecting him
the right as a veteran to be ceremoniously buried among
American servicemen.1
It’s hard to know how it comes to that for some of us. Maybe
mental illness. Cut off from family. Who can say? But sometimes
extreme cases like that of George Bell shine a light on all our
hearts and reveal what is true about our need for relationships
that define us and lift us and ennoble us—for relationships that
save us.
Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you
are mine. Isaiah’s words were God’s words to Israel—just when
they needed them most, when they were a people cut off from
their homeland, exiled in Babylon, confined to servitude, defined
by their captors. Who were they? The only names they were called
were the ones called by their powerful overlords, who told them
they were nothing: they had no purpose in life except to serve
their foreign masters.
But into the midst of this listlessness and lifelessness, they were
surprisingly addressed by the Word of the Lord. You are precious
in my sight, and honored. And I love you.
There it is again. Love. Love gives us value, makes us believe we
are somebodies worthy to live. And when God loves you and
knows your name and honors you, there is nothing in heaven or
earth that can defeat you. The reason is that love connects you to
someone. You matter to someone. And when that someone is God, there is nothing, not even death, that can rob your heart of hope.
There’s a reason so many of our songs are about love. There’s a
reason so much of our poetry is about love. It’s the same reason
our biblical faith is summarized in that way. Do not fear, do not be
afraid. You hear that over and over again if you actually read the
Bible. And right behind it is the love song God is singing to us
through angels and prophets—and most beautifully through
Jesus.
There’s a kind of magic to hearing your name called by someone
you want to love you. You know how it is, don’t you? I hope you
do. When you hear that one call your name—maybe it’s a parent
whose blessing you yearn for; maybe it’s a friend you want to be
more than a friend. It changes you. When the person calls your
name in a certain way, I mean. In a way that comes with a kind of
easy-chair acceptance, with a winking intimacy—with love.
Even Jesus had a moment like that. Luke tells us that Jesus was
standing in line, waiting for his turn to be baptized by his second
cousin, John the Baptist. I think it’s hard for us to imagine that. We
tend to think of Jesus as a celebrity: everyone knows him;
everyone defers to him. He goes to the head of every line. He
never has to wait like everyone else. What’s more, unlike the rest
of us, he knows who he is. He’s the Son of God, don’t you know?!
There have been silly attempts in the history of religion to prove
that Jesus always knew who he was, even from the start. In some
medieval Christian theologies, Jesus speaks from the manger
because his divinity could never have been concealed in his
humanity. The same is true is Islam. In the Qur’an the infant Jesus
comforts his mother right after his birth and declares himself a
prophet of God.
The Bible takes a humbler view. God truly becomes one of us in
Jesus. Jesus has to learn who he is the way we do. One key
moment of that learning is in his baptism. When it’s his turn, he is
praying; and as John baptizes him, a dove descends upon him, and
a voice calls out from heaven, You are my Son, the Beloved, with
you I am well pleased.
Whatever else Jesus had learned about himself and whatever 
 4
other experiences with God that led him to know he was God’s
beloved Son, we don’t know of them. But we do know that in his
baptism God makes it clear to him. Jesus has a spiritual experience
that defines him in his baptism. God knows him. God calls his
name in love and blesses him.
This is why we try in our baptismal services to reenact Jesus’
experience. It’s why the tapestry we designed for the baptistery
has three symbols that hang above the heads of those being
baptized. The dove is there—descending, symbolizing the Holy
Spirit. The burning bush is there, symbolizing God the Father, who
calls out to us the way the Voice called the names of Moses and
Jesus. The chalice is there, symbolizing the Son of God, Jesus, in
whose name we are baptized.
I often tell those being baptized to remember the moment in
Jesus’ life when the heavens opened and the Holy Spirit came
upon him and the voice of God said, You are my Son, the Beloved, in
you I am well pleased. When we are baptized in the name of Jesus,
we have the right to share in his experience. We are in just the
right position to hear the same voice from heaven speaking our
names, claiming us as God’s own, and declaring abiding love for
us.
There’s a reason that a heretic of the early church, Arius, saw this
moment in Jesus’ life as the defining moment of his identity. Arius
believed that in Jesus’ baptism, he was adopted by God as God’s
Son. Arius was the Christian forefather of Islam, always careful to
protect the oneness of God from any idea that God might beget a
Son who was co-equal to the Father or might have a Holy Spirit,
thus completing the Trinity. The one God could not be three and
one at the same time. Arius was good at math and bad at theology.
What the Trinity says about God is that God’s inner being is love
and nothing else, and that God cannot act toward us contrary to
God’s own being; otherwise God would not be God.
So when Jesus heard that he is God’s beloved Son, he heard an
echo of the Voice—to use author N.T. Wright’s lovely phrase,
which has been speaking that word of love for all eternity. And we
also hear it by being baptized in Jesus’ name. We hear an echo of
that same Voice, which has known our names for all time and calls
out to us in love. 
 5
What about you? Who are you? Do you know the deepest truth
about yourself: that you are the beloved child of God—always
have been and always will be, no matter what you have done or
failed to do, no matter what you think of yourself or think others
think of you? If you don’t know that deep in your bones today,
quiet yourself now. Listen for the echo of the Voice that bounces
off Jesus and falls upon you. You. Are. My. Child. My. Beloved. Let
that sink in.
I have a good name—George Mason. It’s my father’s name, too,
but years ago he told me to stop using the Junior because he
wanted me to be my own person. George Mason was my
grandfather’s name, too. He had a different middle name, so I am
technically a junior, not a III. But I worked one summer during
high school “on the boats,” as we say, in New York Harbor. My
father was a Sandy Hook pilot who guided ships in and out of the
harbor. My grandfather was a tugboat captain and later a docking
pilot for those ships. I quickly learned the power of my name. It
seemed I didn’t meet anyone who didn’t know me, because they
knew and admired my father or grandfather. Somehow it wasn’t
about my worthiness, but it was their worthiness that spilled over
on me because I bore their name.
Here’s the thing: if that is true of human beings who know our
names and bless us, imagine what it means that the God of heaven
and earth knows your names? The God whose love and blessing
fell upon Israel and was pronounced for all time upon Jesus is
ringing out eternally in the form of your names, too.
Before you get on to the business of what you are going to do
better or differently this year to be a better you, start here. Start at
the beginning. Start with being rather than doing. Start with who
you are. And who you are is known through whom you love and
who loves you. When God loves you, you are loved. You are loved.
You are loved. You are really, really loved.",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",1/10/2016,
"Two of our four Gospels reference the birth of Christ, and for
most of our time in Advent we have focused on the Gospel of
Luke. It’s where babies are jumping in wombs with wonder and
excitement; songs of gladness are being sung. It also gives us
the most important monologue in Western history--when Linus
shares the Christmas story with Charlie Brown and his other
Peanut friends. Luke has shown us joy, joy, joy! But the Gospel
of Matthew is a little different. Matthew offers its audience a
piece of realism. There is no singing in Matthew; instead there
is weeping. While joy was being born into the world, it seemed
that fear came along with it. It wasn’t war or plagues that drove
this fear. It was all because of an unexpected visit from some
wise men asking about a baby that was battling rashes and in
the stages of teething. Because of this, Jerusalem was in a
state of fear.
Why don’t you take a trip to the past with me? I imagine it is a
Wednesday and Herod is having one of his weekly dinner
parties with dignitaries from all over. Party may be too loose of
a term because what they really did was sit and listen to Herod
tell stories and give future plans for Jerusalem. Then all of a
sudden, a knock interrupts him. The dining room grows quiet.
They can’t see the new guests but their accents sound as if
they come from the Decapolis or even as far away as Persia.
After a brief introduction, they get straight to the point. “Is the
King of the Jews here? This is a palace. This is where the king
would dwell, right?”
Upon hearing this, the dinner guests looked at Herod. Herod’s
enjoyment was wiped off of his face. Within his clouded eyes
you could see the anger and hate building. One by one the
dinner guests found an excuse to leave what had become an
awkward moment. As each guest left the party, fear slowly grew
among all of Jerusalem.
Fear. Why did Herod become fearful? Maybe it was fear that if
there is a king of the Jews the citizens would try to revolt.
Maybe the fear is that Herod’s power and control would be
challenged or lost. If we know anything it is that those who are
in power seek to remain in power. Maybe Herod became fearful because someone figured out he was faking it all this time. He
might have held the title of king but he really didn’t know the
duties of a king! Or could it be fear from just hearing from
others way off in the East that the world would be changing and
it wasn’t a change that he had authorized?
You would think that citizens of Jerusalem would be rejoicing
that a new king was coming; they have probably been
complaining about Herod and his tactics for years! But they,
too, are in fear. Perhaps it is the case that when the psychotic
king is in anxiety, the entire nation is in anxiety with him. They
have seen what Herod can do when he is anxious, like killing
his mother and father-in-law. He not only killed them but also
his favorite wife and three of his sons! They have seen Herod in
fear. They don’t fear for their lives, but they fear for their
livelihood. They fear the changes that will have to take place if
a new king comes. They have learned how to appease Herod.
They already know how to act and what this king likes. Now
they would have to change their habits and learn new ways of
living all because a new King has come! As George (Mason)
once said, “Some would rather have a devil they know than one
they don’t.” And all kings have devilish tendencies, right?
What is interesting is that fear by its very nature is not negative.
Fear is a natural response to physical and emotional danger—if
we didn't feel it, we couldn't protect ourselves from valid threats.
In fact, being in this state has probably saved our species by
knowing fight or flight.
Sometimes fear isn’t all bad, but what makes it negative or
positive are the actions that we attach to it. In the midst of
Herod’s fear he decrees death. While Jerusalem is in fear, they
decided to do nothing. But doing nothing can still add to the
violence. It makes you wonder why one group welcomed the
wise men and the others resisted. What was it that Jerusalem
and Herod really feared?
A couple of months ago, I was invited by Jill and Larry
Granberry, to see The Mountaintop. This is a fictitious play
about the last day of Martin Luther King, Jr’s life. It is a two-person play set at the Lorraine Motel. In one of the scenes the
motel maid said, “Martin why is this important to you, getting all
races to work together or to make peace among them? I bet
you can’t tell me one thing that every person has within
themselves.” Martin sat down in his seat and began to think. As
he thought, I began to wonder along with him of all the things
he could say. Maybe this would be the time that the author
would try to throw some type of theological implication within
the play. Martin stood back up and said “Fear. What is innate in
all human beings is fear. More specifically, the fear of change.”
A few scenes later we find out that the motel maid is no
ordinary maid but an angel that has come to direct Martin to the
other side. What is fascinating is not long before he was giving
the speech on the fear of change and how many people have
such a traumatic time with change. However, as soon as the
angel informs him that change would be coming in his life, he
began to give every excuse why change could not be taking
place within him.
Isn’t that how it works, though? We all want change, change in
our systems and communities. But when it is time for change to
come within us it seems the only thing changing is our emotions
and attitude from joy to fear. Yeah, we want change but not at
the cost of us having to change.
Jerusalem, Herod, and the Wise Men were all challenged by
the birth of Christ. Yet, two were threatened by Jesus and
feared the changes that Christ would bring. I know on most
Epiphany Sundays we focus on the wise men because wise
men still seek him. While that is true, what is also true is that we
are more like Herod and all of Jerusalem than we are the
pagan, gentile astrologers that actually seek and find Jesus. As
Soren Kierkegaard put it, “The power that moved heaven and
earth leaves us completely unmoved.”
Why? We like control, power, structure and order but not
change and undetermined routes. We are like Herod in that we
would rather live in fear. Because through Jesus’ coming, he brought along with him change. And with that, Jesus is a savior
but also becomes a threat to our lives.
Jesus threatens our power, control and societal expectations
that have been settled within us for years. The call to love
“them” may disrupt my social standing. The need to find space
and room for “them” gets in the way of those who are already
here. I get it! Because Christ has come, what he calls us into
are some of the most impossible demands. Demands that our
strength can hardly surmount or our hearts can’t even endure.
To be honest, it is easier to live and obey the “Herods” of our
time, then to live into the change Christ brings.
But I wonder if these demands seem impossible because we
have become so comfortable with waiting. In our world,
massacres come weekly, homelessness and hunger is at an all
time high, and there is constant abuse of people and systems.
When the answers are to kill them, leave them, and disregard
them, it appears as if we still should be waiting. It’s as if we
have been in the season of Advent for years. Like Jerusalem,
we, too, are in a state of fear.
What in the world do we do about our fear?
We mimic the wise men. While fear was implanted into the
world, they searched for the one who would bring them joy. We,
too, shall seek the one who holds joy, hope, peace and love.
Together we should consciously walk in faith toward the
changes, challenges and shifting terrain.
I hate to tell you this but we aren’t in Advent any longer. Christ
already came and brought so much of what we need. Now, it’s
not us waiting on God, but God waiting on us. I tell you, it is a
good thing God is eternal because God sure will be waiting a
long time. That’s because we are Baptists and we don’t like
change!
God is waiting on us to search within ourselves, search within
each other and search within this world so that we might impact
the world with what we find. Don’t let the fear of changes, or
fear of undetermined routes and impossible demands stop you. But if that begins to cloud your perspective, think about the
fears some may live with if we do not participate in bringing the
kingdom of Heaven here on earth.
What I hope comforts you is as we lean into these changes, we
begin to see the presence of God in the midst of our joy and
even our fear.
But I also challenge you to not just seek, not just see, but also
be part of the presence of God.1
 As we do, we remember
Emmanuel, God is with us.
Recently, Wilshire hosted One Starry Night, an interactive
Bethlehem experience. I had the honor of playing one of the
worst characters in the Bible, other than Jezebel or the Beast. I
got to be King Herod. I spoke with Julie Owen about her
painting of King Herod’s Palace. She asked me if I noticed
anything. I must be honest; I am not the best with details. She
pointed right above King Herod’s throne to a window and in this
window was a view of a woman and man sitting inside of a
small building. Julie looked at me and said, “If only Herod would
have just moved or turned around, maybe he would have seen
Baby Jesus.”
After she said this I thought, what if Herod would have turned or
changed his perspective as well? Maybe he would have found
not the baby Jesus he wanted to kill but the Messiah that came
to change the world. Toward whom do you need to change your
perspective today? Maybe it's toward Christ or maybe a certain
life situation or group of people. Either way, we still have time to
see the Messiah and we still have time to be agents of the
change and transformation that Christ brings to us even in our
state of fear. Amen. ",Timothy Peoples,"Dallas, TX",1/3/2016,
"Which came first… the chicken or the egg?
Now it strikes me that with the old conundrum of chicken and egg that both
answers are true.
The end results of the egg is a fertile chicken.
And the beginning of the egg is in the end of the chicken.
Matthew was no stranger to chickens or eggs. And he certainly would have
understood the meaning of an old riddle… which is that our ends are really in our
beginnings.
Matthew would probably agree with that meaning because he foreshadows the
ending of his book right at his beginning.
The book of Matthew ends with Jesus telling his followers to go and make
disciples of all nations.
And here at the beginning of Matthew’s gospel, we see Magi who are
representatives of Persia (which is a nation outside of Israel) coming to Judea to
visit Christ the King and to give him honor
So much of our ends are in our beginnings.
This leads us to ask… What are our ends? Where are we going?
What can the beginning of Matthew’s gospel teach us about the days ahead?
1) Those who seek the King will find wonder.
 The magi have an interpretive range. Call them what you will. Call them
magicians, sorcerers, astrologers, scholars, or as John Milton put it, “star-led
wizards.”
These “star-led wizards” come to Jerusalem asking the question, “where?” 
2
“Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews.”
And the answer to that question is that Jesus is at a place… where stars stand still.
Now maybe you are like many people that I know. It’s been awhile since you’ve
seen anything beyond a cruel, cold, old and calloused world. And perhaps you
want to know where has all the magic gone?
Where is this place where stars stand still? Where is the boy who is more than just
a boy and where dreams are more than just dreams?
Where is that place? And how would we find it?
Now of course not all scholars translate this passage in Matthew like this. Not
everyone renders Matthew saying, “the star had stopped over the place where the
child was.”
Other scholars just translate the passage, “when the wise men saw the star.”

Did the star stand still or not? Maybe this should not be surprising, but not
everybody senses the magic.
Not all will glimpse the wonder. Some will just carry on with their work without
noticing it at all…Biblical scholars included.
And this leaves some of us to wonder whether there was ever really any wonder at
all?
Maybe that star didn’t stand still. Maybe Jesus was just a boy… like any other
boy… and there was no magic at all.
And yet Matthew 2 is persistent in one little detail. The wise men found what they
were looking for.
They found what they were looking for. And in the days ahead…if you go looking
for wonder…you might just find it.
A good friend of mine told me awhile back that his eighth grade daughter came to
him and told him, “Dad, I just can’t believe in God anymore.” 
3
“I just can’t” she said.
Now his daughter had had a hard year at school. One of her friends suffered a
severe spinal injury in a gymnastics accident.
My friend told me that he could tell his eighth grade daughter wasn’t just being
rebellious. He said that he “could see that there was hurt in her eyes.”
I asked my friend, “well, what did you say to your daughter in that moment?”
 (Because I mean, what should you say to a daughter in a moment like that?)
My friend told me that he and his daughter talked for hours that night.
And eventually he told his daughter to “remember the wind.”
“Remember the wind,” he said.
“You can’t see it, but you can see what happens when it blows through the trees.”
My friend told me that the next day he got a text message from his daughter who
was at school.
It read, “Dad, I saw the wind. It was moving through the trees.”
Those who seek the king will find wonder.
Our ends are in our beginnings.
And you were made for wonder.
So look around you and keep your head up.
So what else can we learn about the days ahead from the beginning of Matthew’s
gospel?
2) Those who seek the King will find conflict.
Jerusalem at this time was a place of significant discord and the wise men just
strolled right into it. 
4
Matthew foreshadows the fate of Jesus at the beginning of his gospel.
He hints suggestively at how the conflict will unfold in the rest of the gospel.
The religious establishment of Judaism, the chief priests and the scribes, are
indifferent to Jesus.
The very people who are the experts in the Old Testament scriptures, are the priests
and scribes. They can quote from the Old Testament prophets, and they know what
the scripture says, but they fail to honor what the text means. They don’t go to
Bethlehem, but the wise men do.
What good is having knowledge of the scriptures if we don’t act on it?
There is conflict all over the place in Matthew 2. Even King Herod is getting
twitchy.
Herod, the client king of Judea, is uneasy and agitated and the people of Judea are
too.
Now for a little background on Herod. Herod was only partly Jewish. But he was
notorious for reacting savagely to potential rivals, particularly Jewish rivals.1
The Jewish historian Josephus comments that, in his late age Herod suffered from
illness which compounded his paranoia. In a rage of jealousy, he killed his close
associates. Herod even killed his wife and at least two of his sons.
You get the picture. Politically, Herod was no slouch.
In the Gospel of Matthew Herod carefully manipulates the wise men towards his
own political ends.
You see, even the wise men of this world can be subsumed by the political
maneuvering of powerful people.
There is conflict all over the place in Matthew 2 and it is highly suggestive. In the beginning of Matthew the wise men are looking for “the King of the Jews.”
So, too, is Herod, the representative of Roman rule.
At the end of Jesus’ life, he will be crucified by representatives of Roman rule.
At his death, they hang a sign over his head, which reads. “This is Jesus, the King
of the Jews.”
Our ends are in our beginnings. And you were born into a world of deep conflict
and suffering.
It is a world, like Matthew’s world, where politicians fail and religious experts can
be indifferent.
It’s a world like our world, where key institutions struggle with change.
And the threat of violence is constant.
It is the wise men and women of the world who will keep searching for God even
in the midst of escalating conflict.
Based on Matthew’s gospel what else might we find in the days ahead?
3) Those who seek the King will find glimpses of Joy.
Matthew says that when the wise men saw that the star stopped over the place
where the Christ child was, they “were overwhelmed with joy.”
Now what is Joy?
At the very least, joy is seeing things do what they were created to do.
Joy is watching a golden retriever in the tall grass searching for and finding a ball.
It’s smelling the honeysuckle vine in the woods, watching the child at play,
listening to the saxophonist who nails the solo.
It’s that first kiss from the person you are starting to love. 
6
It’s that moment when you realize your children are becoming your friends over a
plate of enchiladas. Joy is seeing things do what they were created to do. It is the
beginning of the fulfillment of our created purposes.
This is joy. But of course, not everybody will glimpse it.
Not everyone will see the joy.
The Catholic Social worker Jean Vanier founded a community which is called
L’Arche.
L’Arche is a French community for the disabled and mentally ill.
Jean Vanier writes that one day he was sitting with a man, an outsider, who came
to visit the L’Arche community. The man looked at the property and checked in on
the work.
The visitor was sad like a lot of people are sad when they visit these communities.
And Jean Vanier and the visitor began talking in his office.
Suddenly, “there was a knock on the door. And before Vanier could say “Come
in,” a boy named Jean Claude walked in and Jean Claude technically would be
considered as having Down Syndrome.
And Jean Claude shook Vanier’s hand and laughed, and then he shook the hand of
the other man and laughed, and then Jean Claude went out the door chuckling.
After Jean Claude left the room laughing, the gloomy man who had been sitting in
the office looked at Vanier and asked, ‘Isn’t it sad… children like that?’
Vanier writes, “what was sad was that the (gloomy) man was totally blind. He
didn’t see that Jean Claude was happy.”2
The gloomy man wasn’t looking for joy. But Jean Vanier was. By the way, Jean Vanier, before starting the L’Arche community, did his doctoral
dissertation on the subject of happiness in the writings of Aristotle.
Like a wise man, Vanier knew about joy. And he knew what he was looking for.
Our ends are in our beginnings.
And you were made for joy.
So seek it out and it will find you.
So where does all of this leave us in the New Year?
We’ve got wonder, conflict, and joy—all of it held together in the early part of
Matthew’s gospel.
Matthew saw all of these diffused parts of creation coming together in the birth of
the Christ Child.
Matthew tells of a great convergence of beginnings and endings, terrors and tears,
regret and hope, suffering and joy.
And all of it is held together by the story of God with us.
For Matthew, at this gospel’s center, creation congeals. And things come together.
And this is what the power of God is like.
There is a sort of synthesis—a great fusion of elements.
Now, most of us are not astrophysicists but hear me out, briefly.
In the process of nuclear fusion, there is a coming together of powerful atoms
which collide and create fresh energy in creation.
In nuclear fusion, hydrogen and helium protons converge together to create
enormous amounts of light and heat.
Matthew probably didn’t know this. But it is nuclear fusion, this great coming
together, which powers the birth of stars that are in the sky. 
8
And a star in the sky is the very image Matthew uses in his gospel to illustrate the
creative power of God.
You see, the power of God is stellar.
Matthew probably didn’t know much about nuclear fusion.
But if he heard about it, I wonder if he might just shake your hand and laugh.
Amen. 
",Josh Thiering,"Dallas, TX",1/3/2016,
"A long time ago, in a Galilee far, far away …. That’s the way I
started the Christmas storytelling Friday night for our
community-wide event called One Starry Night. For the second
year now, we remade our church building and grounds into the
little town of Bethlehem in the time Jesus was born.
Before the evening began, I asked our organizers what they
wanted me to do. They said just tell the Christmas story. You know
the story, George. You’re a preacher. And yes, I do know it, but still,
how to tell it?
The Gospel writer Luke was one the first Christmas storytellers—
and the most thorough. He made his choices, and he made
different choices than Matthew, who was the next most thorough.
Luke has shepherds and angels, the story of the annunciation and
the trip to Bethlehem. He’s the only one who gives us Mary’s
Magnificat, the song of joy that she sang about her privilege of
being mother of the Lord. My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit
rejoices in God my Savior. Our theme this Advent season has been
My Spirit Rejoices. And today as we get really close to Christmas,
we tell the story of how her spirit and our spirit rejoice … in love.
So, notice first that Luke tells the story about Jesus by telling us
how God chooses to act not only among but also through those the
world deems of little account.1 I mean, think about this: if you
were God, wouldn’t you want to protect yourself from all the
vulnerabilities and chances of what could go wrong by coming
among us? You might give Jesus some spectacular entrance as a
fully-grown man who comes riding into view from who knows
where in order to bypass the danger and messiness of human
birth. I don’t know what the infant mortality rate was back then,
but it must have been high. And what about childbirth itself?
Every time a child is born, even today, we hold our breath. Even if
we have a slew of medical professionals on duty in an antiseptic
hospital delivery room, we know things can go terribly wrong.
Just imagine the situation of Jesus’ birth in that unstable stable
with hoards of flies circling over steaming cow dung, and the noise of braying donkeys and bleating sheep. It’s hard for us to
picture it, especially for how we romanticize the birth of Jesus.
Let’s just plain: like every other birth, Jesus’ birth was bloody. It
was painful. It was worrisome. We don’t get all those details
though. Luke gestures at them by describing the surroundings and
giving us some sweet insight into pregnancy chatter between
Mary and Elizabeth. I can tell you, though, if Luke were Lucy and
not Luke, it would have been different, don’t you know?! If Luke’s
wife, say, had written this Gospel, we’d have gotten a lot more of
our questions answered. I don’t say this to pit the sexes against
each other; only to admit that these are not the questions men ask
about.
Here’s what Kim always asks me when a baby is born in the
church. How long was the labor? Did she have an epidural? Who
was in the room with her? Any complications? How big was the
baby? Where did they get the name?
She wants the bloody details. But there’s a reason the word bloody
is a British cuss word: because it gets too close for comfort to the
truth about Mary’s birthing experience. Did you know that? If you
say, I don’t bloody-well care, or something like that, the word
bloody is a contraction of the words “by our lady.” Which leads
Lauren Winner wittily to comment: The lady is Mary, and the
adjectival curse comes about by contraction.2
There it is. This is what we too easily miss in the story if we don’t
think of God being born into the world by painful contraction. It’s
not just Mary’s contraction, though; it’s God’s. God contracts in
order for divinity to emerge from humanity! How big is that?
The poet-preacher John Donne, captured this enormous truth in
his sonnet Annunciation. To Mary it says: Ere by the spheres time
was created, thou/ Wast in His mind, who is thy Son and Brother;/
Whom thou conceivst, conceived; yea thou art now/ Thy Maker's
maker, and thy Father's mother;/ Thou hast light in dark, and
shutst in little room,/ Immensity cloistered in thy dear womb.
Wow. Just wow. Elizabeth herself seemed to make that claim first. When Mary
visits her and the immediately the child who would be born John
the Baptist leaps in her womb, Elizabeth exclaims the greeting
Hail Mary or Ave Maria and then asks in wonder, Why has this
happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? The …
mother … of … the … Lord! Not to get too deep in the weeds about
Mary being the Mother of God, we should at least be able to see
the astonishing truth that God is working salvation among us by
working through us.
And not just any us—through seemingly insignificant humans.
God comes among us by coming through us. And God comes
among us by coming through people we would not deem worthy
by the world’s standards. Elizabeth’s astonishment of being in the
first Christmas pageant goes to just how unreal this would have
seemed, and still does. That God comes to as one of us is one thing,
but that God comes to us through the lowliest of us is a whole
other thing.
We might expect Jesus to be born the son of the high priest, who
alone could enter into the Holy of Holies once a year. But instead,
he is born to a young woman from Galilee, which even then was
like being from the country. The Judean city folk looked down on
the bumpkins from Galilee.
But this is why Mary’s spirit rejoices in love. God’s love is first
seen in God willingness to embrace the full extent of the human
experience in all of its bloodiness and messiness. Which God still
does in all the bloodiness and messiness of our dysfunctional
families too. And then God’s love is seen in blessing the poor and
despised of the world and giving them the lead roles in the first
act of the drama of salvation.
What that means also is that we can never dismiss anyone as
being beyond God’s using for God’s purposes. What child is this?
we sing at this time of year, including in a few moments as we
close today. But because the Son of God was born to through
people of no account, we now may sing What child is this? about
every child. Whether high-born or low-born each, one is special
and important to God. We look at every child as a child of God—
whether conceived legitimately or illegitimately. In light of the 
 4
circumstances of Jesus’ own birth story, can we ever stigmatize a
child again? We take every child up in arms and see in him or her
a reflection of God’s love.
Which leads to the other side of this: that love is not only God’s
love; it is our love too. Mary sings, MY spirit rejoices. Mary and
Elizabeth in our text today not only end up playing key roles in the
story of God’s salvation because God has chosen them, but also
because they were open to accepting the part. They risked
everything to return God’s love with their own love.
Love requires an open heart that says yes, not no, even when it is
hard. Love welcomes the surprise of an unexpected child and is
willing to change in whatever way necessary to accept him or her.
Mary’s story informs us and forms us. If ever there was a case
where we could say that “life is what happens to you while you
are making plans,” this is it. If ever there was a case where we
could say “If you want to make God laugh, tell God your plans,”
this is it. Mary must have had her own dreams. But by saying yes
to this surprising child, Mary becomes a model for us all—not just
a model for women, a model for women and men both. She loves
God in return by loving the child that comes into her life. Mary is a
figure of virtue to this day because of her openness to God.
Sadly, every child does not have a mother who welcomes him or
her in this way. And too many are left to linger in limbo, having to
depend upon strangers to make them feel at home in the world.
I’ve been heartened and disheartened by the ruling this week of a
federal court that the foster care system in our state has to
change. U.S. District Judge Janis Graham Jack said that the system
puts roughly 12,000 youngsters in poorly supervised
environments where they are often subjected to terrible and
irreparable harm. Although the Department of Family and
Protective Services acts with good intent, the system is
underfunded, understaffed, and poorly managed. The system is
broken for all stakeholders, she said, including DFPS employees who
are tasked with impossible workloads. Most importantly, though, it
is broken for Texas’ [permanent managing conservatorship]
children, who almost uniformly leave state custody more damaged 
 5
than when they entered.3
Getting this right is one way Texas can act in love toward children
whose parents are unable or unwilling to love and care for them
as Mary would. And foster parents who welcome these children
and care for them are being Mary to them.
But then there was the story of the 800 or so undocumented
immigrant youths who are being sent to camps and retreat
centers in Ellis and Rockwall counties for temporary shelter and
housing. One of our members, Christine Wicker, was telling me
about listening to the owners of one of the camps on the news
talking with joy about receiving these children. We want them all,
the man said. And Christine told me that she thought when she
heard him that he must be a Christian. And then she saw that he
was and she said that that’s the spirit of Christ that makes all the
difference in how we treat vulnerable children.4
Yesterday, about 300 refugees, including many children—mostly
Muslims, had Christmas in our Community Hall. Gateway of Grace,
started by Samira Izadi, whom we saw come to Christ and
baptized in this church, is teaching us how to rejoice in love over
the coming of these desperate people into our midst. We are so
proud to be partners in this ministry.
Where did we learn this? From Mary. And we learned from her
boy who grew up to be our Savior that you can never write off
children based on the circumstances of their birth or the families
they come from. We can never know what God might want to do
for the world through any child.
The last thing is this: Luke is the only storyteller to include what
has become a staple of all Christmas celebrations. Singing. Angels
sing. John the Baptist’s father, Zechariah, sings. The old priest
Simeon sings. Mary sings. It’s as if their hearts can’t contain the
love. Words are not enough by themselves. They break out in song
one after the other. Can you imagine Christmas without music? It’s one of the best
ways we express our love and gratitude to God. Even Silent Night
is a song. Go figure. Guess we just can’t help ourselves. But then
again, that’s why Christ came, isn’t it? Because we just can’t help
ourselves. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",12/20/2015,
"Were you struck as I was by the last line of our text in Luke today?
After John the Baptist delivered a spellbinding hellfire-anddamnation
sermon, Luke said, So, with many other exhortations, he
proclaimed the good news to the people.
It makes me think about going to the doctor and being told that
my health is generally good but that my personal and family
history requires me to make some hard changes if I want to live a
long and happy life. Whoopee. John has just told his audience that
they can’t relax and think that everything will be fine. Judgment is
coming, and they need to make some changes. Good news. Joy to
the world, don’t you know?!
But hearing the truth is good news, even if it doesn’t feel like it at
the moment. The gospel points us to the life that really is life. And
if we want to know true joy, this is the path to it.
John began by challenging his Jewish hearers not to rely on their
religious identity for security. Religious practice is what leads to
real religious identity. You are what you do.
And that’s as true for us as Christians today as it was for the Jews
in that day. They had been taking their relationship with God for
granted. Abraham is our father. We’re good. Those Romans don’t
know God like we do. They’re in big trouble. But John told us not to
be complacent. He told us to live like true children of Abraham—
but not to show our identity cards.
And when the crowd asked him what he meant, what they needed
to do, he got specific. He told them to share what they had with
their neighbors who had less, to be fair in their business dealings,
and not to bully other people—but to be content with their wages.
I was in Washington, D. C., last week and took a ride from an Uber
driver named Zia. He was from Afghanistan. He asked me why I
was in town. I told him I was there to help lobby for regulations of 
 2
the payday- lending industry that was ripping people off and
crippling their financial and family lives. He was all for it and
asked why I doing it. I told him that I was a Christian minister and
that I believe God wants us to stand up for those who are being
abused and need help. He was really glad to hear it, because it
isn’t how he hears most Christians talking about their faith these
days. He said that he is a Muslim and that he was taught that
people are not Muslims just because they say they are, but only if
they do what they are supposed to do. He said that his father
wouldn’t let them have a refrigerator in their house when he was
growing up because if they had one, they might store up food for
days that should be given to hungry neighbors. They could buy
food only for each day and trust God that there would be more the
next day.
This story sounds a lot like the Lord’s Prayer to me: Give us this
day our daily bread. And John told us that if we have two coats, we
should give one to someone who has no coat, and if we have food,
we must do likewise.
We are in a moment right now across the world in which this
attitude is vitally important. I’m afraid that the main thing that
Muslims and others are hearing from Christians these days is an
assertion of our Christian identity more often than an example of
our Christian living. We are claiming the truth of our religion
against the falsity of other people’s religions, but the proof of our
faith is in our practice, not our preaching.
While claiming to be followers of Jesus, we defend an economy in
which one of every five children in our own country goes to bed
hungry. While claiming to be followers of Jesus, we defend and
promote policies that would leave desperate refugees to linger in
camps and wonder whether they will survive—all in order to
ensure that we are protected from the few bad actors who wish us
ill. While claiming to be followers of Jesus, we tell Muslims that we
don’t want a relationship with them, even though they too are
made in the image and likeness of God, who loves them and sent
Jesus to be their Savior, too. No wonder our witness sounds
hollow.
It bears noting that the people whom John was talking to also felt 
 3
that their country had been taken over by people who didn’t know
God the way they did. They were preoccupied with the way to end
the occupation. They wanted to take back their country. They
wanted to drive the foreigners out of Palestine and regain the
Promised Land that God had given them.
Sound familiar? In one way or another, we hear that logic in our
rhetoric. This is a Christian nation. We are being occupied by
those who don’t share our religion or values. Secularists. Muslims.
People who think they have a right to live among us on equal
terms. Never mind that they do. Our Constitution says that we
can’t use religion to define a true American. It doesn’t say that we
should just tolerate people of different religions or no religion.
Religious liberty is for everyone or for no one. And yet we have
candidates for public office who believe that we must reassert our
Christian identity or God will not bless our land. We have some
who are calling for a ban on all Muslims entering this country and
even on those who are already here. Well, joy to the world. Good
news.
This is the Sunday in Advent when we celebrate joy. My spirit
rejoices in joy. Redundant, I know, but the point is that Christians
proclaim that Jesus came to give us abundant life and called us to
live as witnesses to that joy.
Molly Marshall is the president of Central Baptist Theological
Seminary in Kansas City, Kansas. She has preached for us here at
Wilshire. She wrote an Advent meditation this week in which she
cited Pope Francis’ call for a year of jubilee. The word jubilee of
course means “joy.” But the biblical year of Jubilee happens every
fifty years, and in this year all debts are cancelled. It was a way of
building mercy into Israel’s consciousness and a way of saying
that everyone should have a chance to start over and experience
God’s joy. It’s only been fifteen years since the last year of Jubilee,
but the pope recently strode out of the Vatican Holy Door, side by
side with his predecessor, and said: How much wrong we do to God
and his grace when we speak of sins being punished by his judgment
before we speak of their being forgiven by his mercy. We have to put
mercy before judgment.” Molly said, Far too often we have reversed
this … order of salvation, not only for others whom we deem only fit
for condemnation, but for ourselves. She said that we sometimes 
 4
forget that God has shown us mercy before judgment, and we
have to do that for others, too. Mercy, she said, is not an optional
expression of being a Christian; it is learning to deal with others as
God deals with us. Mercy does require us to hold possessions more
lightly, grudges more briefly and self-protection more rarely.1
So, John, what should we do? We may expect John to tell us to join
the revolution. We may expect that he would have called us to
take up arms against those who are our enemies. There were
many movements in John’s day—as there are in our day—who
would see this kind of response as the path to faithfulness. John
doesn’t go there. He calls us to do simple and mundane things that
reflect the character of our faith. He tells us to love our neighbor,
whoever that may be. And he gives us small and practical ways to
do so.
Sharing is the first response, he says. Don’t let your possessions
possess you. Don’t be occupied with accumulating things. B. J.
Thomas sang a song years ago that went like this: Using things and
loving people, that’s the way it’s got to be./Using things and loving
people, look around and you can see. /Loving things and using
people only leads to misery./Using things and loving
people, that’s the way it’s got to be. When we get that right, we
have joy, and we proclaim joy to the world. When we get that
wrong, we all participate together in a life of misery.
It’s not that complicated. The other day I was talking to two of our
members, Larry and Linda Walton. They have moved to a high rise
near the church after years of living in a larger house. They enjoy
their two-bedroom condo, but they said that the move has created
for them a good excuse for doing what is right anyway. They don’t
have as much space as they used to, so they have a rule that if one
thing comes in, one thing goes out. They are learning to hold
possessions more lightly.
I love that. And it’s sending me to my closet. From time to time I
go there and ask myself if I have something hanging there that I
haven’t worn in more than a year. It makes me think that if I am
just storing something there for myself, I am keeping it from someone who probably needs it more than I do. It’s not a bad idea,
especially at this time of year. As the weather gets colder, there
are people on the streets of Dallas who need what we have.
As we think of our big feasts at Thanksgiving and Christmas, we
are reminded that there are many who need the extra food we
have on our tables. As I talked to a small group of deacons after
our church-wide Thanksgiving dinner, they discussed their
feelings about throwing away so much of the meal our chef had
prepared for us. Something felt wrong about that to them. Exactly.
And now we have to figure what to do about it.
Likewise, John told tax collectors to be fair with those they
collected tolls from others. In his day, the practice was to pay the
Romans the toll portion but overcharge people and keep the extra
money for themselves. John said that we are to think about our
customers, not just our own profits. And he told the soldiers, who
were Jewish mercenaries, not Romans, to be content with their
wages and not to use their positions to extort people because of
their position.
John ended his sermon by talking about the final judgment. He
used the image of the winnowing of wheat from chaff. In his day,
workers separated the good wheat from the lighter chaff by
tossing it into the wind. The heavier wheat fell to the ground; the
lighter chaff was blown away to who knows where.
John was saying that our lives are like that. We can’t take our
possessions with us. Only what we have that’s of spiritual
substance will be deemed worthy at the time of judgment.
Everything else is gone. So let it go. Give away what won’t last.
Christmas is a time to practice generosity. We give at this time of
year as a practice of the way we ought to live all year long. How
are you doing? It could be a matter of life or death, but it surely
will be a matter of misery or joy. Amen.
",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",12/13/2015,
"Luke starts out by explaining what historical era he was writing
about. This approach is interesting in itself, because we aren’t
used to hearing about it in the way he tells it. We would expect
him to say something like this: In the fall of the year AD 27, the
word of God came to John. … We might even like to know the
month, day and hour. Was it December, the tenth month of the Old
Roman calendar that became the twelfth month when January and
February were added but kept the “tenth month” name? Was it
Sunday, the day named for the sun goddess? Was it 9:00 in the
morning or 11:00 at night? Was John awake when he got the
word, or did it come to him in his sleep?
But that isn’t the way people told time back then. They didn’t have
calendars or clocks like ours. They told time by mentioning the
important people who were in charge of the world at the moment.
And so we hear Luke tell us the following when John got the word:
In the fifteenth year of the reign of Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius
Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was ruler of Galilee, and
his brother Philip was the ruler of the region of Ituraea and
Trachonitis, and Lysanias was ruler of Abilene, during the high
priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas. … That’s when the word of God
came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.
So what’s the meaning of this approach? Luke wants us to
understand that ours is a God of history. The word of God doesn’t
hover above us timelessly; it happens in time. God decides the
time because God is really the one in charge.
Rome was paranoid about any challenge to its reign. As most
regimes did, they framed their self-interest in terms of keeping
the peace. The so-called Pax Romana—or the peace of Rome—was
the aim of every emperor. All of Rome’s armies and rulers
preserved the peace at any cost. And yet Luke is telling us that all
human efforts to bring lasting peace by force will fail. Peace does
not come from stronger militaries or mightier rulers.
And don’t we feel that ourselves right this minute? Don’t we sense 
 2
the powerlessness of our military power and political might?
What can be done about ISIS? How will their murderous ways be
stopped? I’m afraid I’m a lousy pacifist when it comes to this cult
of death that perverts the name of God. But even if we bomb ISIS
to smithereens, we know they will reappear and regroup
somehow. Even if we send the largest ground force of the
strongest powers on earth into Iraq and Syria, at the end of the
conflict we will have created more conflict. Violence begets
violence begets violence.
And what about the mass shootings in our own country? What can
be done? We certainly can’t depend upon politicians to help. They
talk tough and do nothing. All they ultimately seem to care about
is staying in power. In the past week or so, we’ve had two kinds of
maniacs destroy the lives of innocent citizens. One opened fire at a
Planned Parenthood clinic, and the other, a radicalized Islamic
couple with a six-month-old daughter, opened fire on the man’s
work colleagues at a holiday party. Call them all terrorists if you
wish. Parse out Islamic terrorism from other mass murderers if
you want. Who cares? All of that is distracting from the real
question about how to stop this insanity. The blaming and fingerpointing
is exhausting, and nothing gets done except for ramping
up our defensiveness.
When we do so, one approach is to arm ourselves more. The
average gun owner in our country now owns five guns. There are
as many guns in America as people. And yet we feel no safer. Some
people on the other side of this issue would like to believe that if
we could only outlaw guns altogether, we could stop the madness.
Or if we could somehow limit the access to handguns and
automatic weapons, or make it at least as hard to get a gun as it is
to get a driver’s license, that would help. Or maybe we could make
gun owners take out insurance policies in the event that they
misuse their guns to take lives. You can bet insurance companies
will do good background checks on them.
I’m on the no-guns-but-hunting-rifles side of things,. It has
nothing to do my reading of the Second Amendment. It has to do
with the fact that Jesus carried a cross, not a concealed weapon.
One of my best friends is completely on the other side. He asked
me recently if I have armed security at church to protect me 
 3
against an attack. Many pastors have an armed security detail. I
told him that I’m good; I’ve got deacons. They roam the halls on
Sundays, and just so you know … they’re packing—walkie-talkies.
And if you don’t think terrorists would be afraid of Wilshire
deacons on patrol, you don’t know our deacons, don’t you know?!
But really, I can understand why some preachers might worry
about reprisals from outsiders— on account of their preaching. If
you point the finger at everyone but yourself, sooner or later
someone may point a finger or something more lethal than that at
you.
But here’s the thing: even if we were all to arm or disarm
ourselves, all that is still not getting us to the kind of peace that
God wants to bring the world. That peace is deeper and fuller than
the issue of killing or not killing each other. It’s rooted in a change
of heart and mind and character that has rid itself of hatred and
evil and self-interest altogether. The real question for the world is,
where you are going to find such a change? THAT is why the word
of God came to John in the wilderness.
John is a nobody by the standards of worldly power. He lives in
the wilderness of Judea, not in the city of Jerusalem. He wears
clothes made of itchy camel’s hair, which is a constant reminder of
the discomfort of this life and the need to depend upon God at
every moment. He eats locusts and wild honey. And people
probably thought he was a little crazy in the head. Surely this guy
can’t matter in relation to the problems of the world. Surely he
can’t make a difference.
Harper McKenzie is having a big day today. She’s featured in the “I
Am Wilshire” column in the Tapestry. And I’m about to tell you
about her devotional essay in our Advent booklet from this week.
Harper, a junior in high school, reflected on the general feeling of
powerlessness that youth feel about their lives. She recalled an
incident that happened in her sixth-grade Sunday school class. In
response to something the teacher said, Brian Akins asked, But
what can I do? I’m just a kid. Harper said: Our teacher stopped us in
our tracks, knowing that we felt this way. He went on to tell us how
every little thing we do changes the world, and if we can muster up
the courage to be nice to one person, the world is better for it. This
sentiment is true, truer than we can know. No matter how old we 
 4
are, who we are and what we may or may not lack, we hold power
and the ability to shape the world. All people have the ability to
change the world by being themselves and following their dreams.
Each person makes the world go around in his or her own way. It is
these ways that make us powerful. But if we ever forget the power
we hold, which we surely will, we can turn to God. … God knows that
we are mighty.
Harper ended by talking about how we are mighty—not because
we make ourselves mighty but because we have an almighty God
who empowers us.
John the Baptist was one of the most powerful world-changing
figures ever to stride onto the stage of history. He didn’t live long.
He lost his head—literally—when he called on King Herod to
repent. But his preaching of repentance ushered in the reign of
Jesus, the Prince of Peace.
What John preached was a call for all people to take responsibility
their own lives before God. Repent. Change your mind. Let God
change your heart and reorient your life.
This is what we all can do. This is what the church can do in a
society that keeps “othering” people, that keeps focusing on how
everyone else is the problem. It’s Islamic terrorists or it’s the
President. It’s the Democrats or it’s the Republicans. It’s Planned
Parenthood, or it’s the Supreme Court. It’s right-wingers or it’s
left-wingers. It’s gays or it’s guns. It’s you, but it’s never me.
Stop it. When the church does nothing but chime in, in a world
that only finds fault and fixes blame on others, we are no different
from any other special-interest group. But when we attend to
ourselves, we are starkly different. When we ask God to make us
into what God wants us to be, we are different.
Then we are spiritually responsible beings. Such beings do not
divide the world into the good guys and the bad guys. They
understand that, as Solzhenitzyn put it, the line between good and
evil runs down the middle of the heart of every human being. We
have to begin with ourselves.

I am really proud today that my alma mater, the University of
Miami, has hired Mark Richt to be its new head coach. Richt
played quarterback at Miami, beginning the year after I graduated.
Because he came in with Jim Kelly, who went on to the NFL Hall of
Fame, Richt played about as much as I did. But he’s been a very
successful college coach at Georgia—and I mean successful in
every way that matters: winning on the field and winning off it.
At the press conference on Friday, a reporter asked him how
different a person is from the time when he played at Miami. He
didn’t hesitate. He said that in 1986 he became a born-again
Christian, and in doing so he found a peace that he had never
known before. And then he said that what changed for him is that
he began to think about other people instead of being selfobsessed.
He is less concerned now with himself and more
concerned about how to contribute to the well-being of others.
The change he describes is what true repentance is all about. It
isn’t just about being sorry for your sins. It isn’t just about being
forgiven and then feeling that you’ve got heaven taken care of. It’s
about paving the road for others and making it straight. It’s about
filling in the valleys and lowering the mountains, thus making it
easier for others to see the coming of King Jesus.
St. Francis said it best in his famous prayer:
Lord, make me an instrument of your peace;
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
and where there is sadness, joy.
Grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console;
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love;
for it is in giving that we receive,
it is in pardoning that we are pardoned,
and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.

So, in the seventh year of President Barack Obama, when Greg
Abbott was governor of Texas and Mike Rawlings was mayor of
Dallas, and during the papacy of Pope Francis, has the word of
God come to you? ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",12/6/2015,
"Our Advent theme this year is “My Spirit Rejoices.” It’s based on
the second line of Mary’s song, which we call the Magnificat. My
soul magnifies the Lord, she sings, and my spirit rejoices in God my
Savior. During Advent we will join Mary in rejoicing in the usual
four virtues of hope, peace, joy and love. This week, My Spirit
Rejoices … in Hope.
The first Sunday of Advent every year is a bit jarring. In many
years, like this year, it comes on the heels of Thanksgiving, family
gatherings, Black Friday and all the other activities that begin the
Christmas season for Christians. Then we come to church in the
midst of all this and hear about the end of the world. Jesus says,
There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on the
earth distress among nations. … People will faint from fear and
foreboding of what is coming upon the world. You heard the whole
text a few minutes ago. What did you think when you heard it?
Not a very Christmas-y feel-good word from Jesus, is it?
But here’s the thing: Jesus is just telling us the truth about hope
that is hard for many of us to accept. We tend to fall into one of
two patterns of thinking about hope that always disappoint:
romantic nostalgia for a past we can never recover or naïve
optimism for a future we can never create. Neither of these is
Christian hope.
I read a report this week in the satirical magazine The Onion. The
headline stated: “Experts Say the Best Option Now Is Keeping
Nation As Comfortable As Possible Till the End.” The piece cited
sociologists, historians, economists, environmentalists and
lawmakers, who all proclaimed that America is on its last legs,
that it can barely succeed in carrying out basic functions, and that
it is simply more merciful to accept the reality of its demise than
to keep providing false hope of a return to former glory. One faux
expert said it this way: “At the end of the day, it’s nearly 240 years
old—what can you reasonably expect?” Others agreed with [him],
saying that, with America having gradually become a weak, almost 
2
unrecognizable shadow of its former self, the priority now should be
ensuring that it is given whatever palliative support it needs and
using the remaining time to put the nation’s affairs in order.1
Satire works when you sense a ring of truth in it. But underlying
this report is the assumption that the way forward is the way
back, and when the way back seems hopeless—well, then, all hope
is lost. Maybe the church’s role should just be to keep people calm
and promise them heaven when it’s all over.
But that’s not Christian hope. For one thing, Christian hope is
never the same as nationalist hopes. When Jesus spoke these
words in Luke 21, he was standing in front of the Temple in
Jerusalem, and he announced that the Temple itself would not
stand. The massive and impressive symbol of Israel’s national
identity would fall. Why, it would be like the White House being
blown up, or maybe the Twin Towers collapsing. The Temple was
destroyed in 70 CE by the Romans, and nationalist dreams were
dashed. Yet the people survived as the people of God, beyond the
nation of Israel.
You see, the end of any country as it has been known—including
ours—is still not the end of hope.
My preacher son-in-law, Garrett Vickrey, was at my house this
week. My three granddaughters allowed him to come along to
Pops and Giddy’s house, don’t you know?! Garrett was working on
his sermon before I was, so I will credit him with this story he is
sharing this morning at Woodland Baptist Church in San Antonio
about one of our favorite theologians.
Clinging to a plank of wood in the North Sea, Juergen was hanging
on for dear life … though it seemed as if life were over already. He
watched as bomber after bomber rained fire from the sky over his
hometown— Hamburg, Germany. He watched from the freezingcold
waters as his world came to an end. Neighborhoods he knew
like the backs of his hands, places he could walk through
blindfolded. He’d been there so many times. So many familiar faces. All gone, covered in the rubble and wreckage of conflict. At
17, Juergen was in the Nazi Air Force auxiliary, working in an antiaircraft
battery there in Hamburg. Before he knew what had
happened, a bomb dropped from the sky and separated him from
his best friend, who had been by his side. It killed his friend and
dropped Juergen into the water. When the bombing finally
stopped and the sun came up, he and the other survivors made
their way through the charred remains of their hometown and
surrendered to the English forces moving into northern Germany.
The bombing had lasted only a few days, but 40,000 people lost
their lives in Hamburg. Another 40,000 had been killed in the
period leading up to this day—murdered by the Germans for
being Jews, dissenters or both.
For three years Juergen was a prisoner of war in a Scottish camp.
A chaplain gave him a Bible. He read the Psalms; he read Mark’s
gospel. The cries of Jesus on the cross spoke to him in a way that
nothing else ever had. He saw in him one who knew his suffering,
the suffering of all the world. And it changed him forever. In the
cries of the Christ at the end of his life, Juergen found strength to
start over.
He decided to study theology, and today Juergen Moltmann is one
of the most influential theologians alive. At 89 years old, he is still
read by most seminarians and still lectures around the world. It
was his experiences in World War II, in the devastation of his
hometown and the redemption he experienced as a prisoner of
war, that shaped him. He said, The kindness which Scottish miners
and English neighbors showed the German prisoners of war who
were at that time their enemies shamed us profoundly. We were
accepted as people … but that made it possible for us to live with the
guilt of our own people, the catastrophes we had brought about and
the long shadows of Auschwitz. …
After three years as a prisoner, he returned home. He recalls it
this way: In 1948 I returned to Hamburg, limping indeed like Jacob
but “blessed.” That was my new beginning, the beginning I arrived
at when Hamburg was at its end: in the end was my beginning … I 
4
discovered that in every end a new beginning lies hidden. It will find
you if you look for it.2
I spent some time this week looking at photographs on the
Internet of refugees from Syria and other countries in the Middle
East—desperate people fleeing the ravaging cruelty of ISIS and
the Syrian dictator Assad. They have all lost their countries.
Thousands of Muslims and Christians have seen their world come
to an end and are looking for a new beginning. Their only hope is
the kindness of strangers. Some of them are finding it in a way
similar to what Moltmann had experienced. Others are not so
lucky.
A massive relocation of humanity is under way. And all of this
scares us in so many ways. We are afraid because we can’t control
our own security. We are afraid because we sense that our
country and our world will never be the same. The church should
be the one place where you hear the truth about that: It never will
be the same. But that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a new
beginning to be found in every end.
After his theological training, Moltmann went on to write his
signature book, titled A Theology of Hope. A key argument of the
book is that Christian hope is found in the coming of God, not in
the coming back of a lost world or in the coming to be of any
human scheme.
Being ready for this future that God is bringing requires on the
one hand that we let go of the past as our template for hope.
Admittedly, that’s all we have to go on from experience. And who
wants to do that? We want to hold on, not let go. We want to be
comfortable; we don’t want to be challenged.
There’s a church in Moore, Oklahoma, whose motto is Church Just
Like It Used to Be. Good luck with that. It’s not in our power to
control the work of the Holy Spirit, who is making all things new.
As Moltmann likes to say, The future is God’s proper mode of being.
In other words, we honor God best when we embrace with faith what God is doing, even if we don’t know precisely what that is at
any given moment.
Alison Wingfield is editing a new book about how the church can
live with resurrection hope in an age of church decline. Here are
some lines to ponder: Loving the future isn’t easy. Especially when
we sense that death is nearing—in our own lives or in our beloved
institutions—it may be tempting to reject the future, even mock it
or resent it. The future seems indifferent to the value of our
existence, to all that we have been and tried to be, even to the gifts
that we have offered with all our hearts. But loving the future is one
of the most important ways we love God. Loving the future testifies
that God will not be finished, even when we are. Loving the future
testifies that God is God and that we are us, that God knows things
that we don’t know and does things that we can’t do. Loving the
future sacrifices our ability to know things and our ability to shape
things—two of the human treasures that we guard most closely.3
That last part is important, too. It’s on the other hand of naïve
optimism about out efforts to make the future. While we are not
to wait passively for the future God is bringing—we are told to
watch for it and bear witness to signs of its appearing— still, we
cannot bring it to pass by all our hard work and good intentions.
The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade happened as usual this past
Thursday down 6th Avenue in New York City. If you haven’t seen
the Christmas advertising theme, it’s Believe. That’s the word that
pops out at you. Believe in the Magic of Giving. So, on the good side,
Macy’s is once again teaming up with the Make-a-Wish
Foundation to provide up to $1 million to help make the wishes of
terminally ill children come true. For every letter a child writes to
Santa, Macy’s sends a dollar to Make-a-Wish. It’s all part of the
“Miracle on 34th Street” magic of the Macy’s tradition.
But magic implies that there will be no pain. Just believe. And yet
Mary believed and still had to go through childbirth to receive
what she was promised. And we too, Jesus says, must go through
trials to come in order to experience redemption. I fear the Macy’s believe campaign also plays into the underlying
secularization of Christian hope that says that if we believe in
ourselves and act, we can change the world. We hear it in our
politics, especially from the left: if only we can elect the right
person, if only we can pass the right laws, then we can engineer a
future better than we have known. But that sort of self-help
activism isn’t Christian belief, either, and it certainly isn’t
Christian hope.
Neither conservative longing for a disappearing past nor liberal
optimism for a future of our making is Christian hope. Christian
hope is rooted in God’s promise that our redemption is drawing
near. God is coming. So lift up your hearts, Christian friends.
Rejoice in hope. 
",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",11/29/2015,
"There’s an old African proverb that says, When elephants fight, the grass
suffers.
When we pick up the story of the prophet Elijah in 1 Kings 17, he is on
the run. He has recently spoken truth to power, telling King Ahab of
Israel that the God who made heaven and earth, not the pagan rain god,
Baal, is the source of prosperity. God will therefore withhold rain from
Israel to prove it. The palace and the people can make all the sacrifices
to Baal they want to, but since Baal has no power to give rain or
anything else, their sacrifices will do no good.
So God and Baal fought, and the grass suffered. The drought first forced
Elijah east of the Jordan River to a small creek, where God gave him
water to drink and ravens brought him road kill to eat. When the creek
dried up, God sent him west toward the Mediterranean coast, farther
outside of Israel, to the village of Zarephath, which was in the heart of
Baal-worshiping Phoenicia.
Now this is interesting. Zarephath is in Sidon, where the king’s daughter
Jezebel is from. King Ahab married Jezebel, and she brought all her Baal
worship with her, thereby bringing idolatry into Israel. Now God sends
the prophet right into that enemy territory to find help.
This is a foreshadowing of Jesus’ parable of the Good Samaritan. Elijah
would find kindness and welcome outside his own people. Elijah, the
desperate refugee, would be fed and housed by a widow whose people
were Israel’s enemies. What’s old is new, don’t you know?!
We are told that God had commanded the widow of Zarephath to feed
Elijah. In other words, a God she didn’t know somehow suggested that
she receive and care for a man she hadn’t even met.
Here’s a chance for us to remember that God doesn’t work just through
Christians whom we know and trust. God is at work in the world in
mysterious ways to save us and provide for us—sometimes through
people of different faiths and no faith as well as through people of like
faith. This ought to inform us in these times that when we close 
2
ourselves off from neighbors from around the world who are in dire
need, it might be that we are closing ourselves off from the very people
God has prepared to help us, too.
The drought has not only struck Israel; it has struck Israel’s neighbors
because of Israel’s sin. So when Elijah comes to the city gate of
Zarephath, the unsuspecting widow is gathering sticks for kindling a fire
to cook a final meal. Elijah has no way of knowing this, but he asks her
first for water, which she is quick to provide. Then he asks her for bread.
Here’s where the story gets interesting.
The woman tells him that she has only enough meal in a jar and oil in a
jug for one last supper. She and her son will eat that and then die
because nothing is left in the cupboard.
Let’s consider this woman. A widow in that time would have been
incredibly vulnerable. She and her son would have had to rely upon
family or the kindness of neighbors just to stay alive day by day. And
when a famine hit, the poor would have been affected first. Yet notice
this: God sends Elijah to the poorest of the poor to find help. The truth
is, the poor tend to teach us the most about generosity because they
themselves know what real need is all about.
The woman’s first response to Elijah is natural. She looks at what she
has and sees scarcity and looming death. She wants to provide first for
her own family. But God has already given her the idea to respond with
kindness toward a stranger. It must be scary to her. She must think she
is being a terrible mother. But she must feel a burden to help in her
bones.
Elijah says the magic words we hear in scripture over and over any time
God enlists anyone into divine service. Do not be afraid. Do not be afraid.
Why do you think that’s the first word? Because, I think, while some fear
is useful to alert us to real danger, excessive fear turns us inward
instead of outward. It makes us want to wall ourselves off from
strangers. It fuels our worry about the future. It shudders at change. It
clings to the little we have. It balls our hands up in fists. It immobilizes
us. Fear shuts off the spigot of stewardship. You get the idea.
But do you? I mean, isn’t fear one of the reasons we don’t give more to
the Lord? God provides for us more than we can imagine, but when we 
3
look at what we have, all we see is little instead of much. And when we
do that, we miss out on so much more that is possible for us to
experience about life.
Morris and his wife, Esther, went to the state fair every year, and every
year Morris would say, Esther, I'd really like to ride in that helicopter.
Esther always replied, I know, Morris, but that helicopter ride is fifty
dollars, and fifty dollars is fifty dollars. Later in their lives Esther and
Morris went to the fair as usual, and Morris said, Esther, I'm 85 years old.
If I don't ride that helicopter, I might never get another chance. Esther
replied as she always had: Morris, that helicopter ride costs fifty dollars,
and fifty dollars is fifty dollars.
Well, it turns out the helicopter pilot overheard the couple and said,
Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take the both of you for a ride. If you can
stay quiet for the entire ride and don't say a word, I won't charge you a
penny! But if you say one word, it's fifty dollars. Morris and Esther agreed,
and up they went. The pilot did all kinds of fancy maneuvers, but not a
word was heard. He did his daredevil tricks over and over again, but still
not a word. When they landed, the pilot turned to Morris and said, By
golly, I did everything I could to get you to yell out, but you didn't. I'm
impressed! Morris replied, Well, to tell you the truth, I almost said
something when Esther fell out, but you know, fifty dollars is fifty dollars!
Some of us are more like old Esther and Morris than we want to admit.
We hold on so tight to that last fifty dollars that we end up sacrificing
life itself in homage to it. But what if the way God works in the world is
precisely to show us God’s provision only as we participate in the
mystery of faith?
Most of you know that giving is essential to the Christian life. You may
even understand that the biblical principle of tithing is the benchmark
of a life of giving. Tithing is an act of thanksgiving. It is giving back to the
Lord the first 10 percent of your income out of gratitude for what God
has given you. You make it the first thing you do with your money, not
the last. You trust that if you give back to God the first 10 percent, God
will continue to provide everything you need, and more, in order that
you may always experience God’s abundance. You know these things,
and yet you have a hard time practicing them. Why is that?
It isn’t because you haven’t got something to give. No one could have
had less than this widow, and yet she gave. Some of you see only what 
4
you don’t have instead of what you do have, and it scares you away from
giving. But again, what if the only way you can experience the mystery
of God’s abundance is by giving of what you have?
Also, our failure to give doesn’t occur because God hasn’t called us to
give. Notice that God commanded the widow to give before Elijah
arrived. His arrival was the moment for her to act on the faith God had
already put in her. No, it wasn’t easy. We are schooled by the world in a
scarcity mentality that makes us scared. By the way, do you hear the
linking of sounds—scarce and scare? But what God requires of us, God
provides for us. God had been preparing her heart even before the
occasion had arisen. And Elijah was simply the one to call out a faith
from her that she didn’t know existed.
First give me something to eat, Elijah says. First take care of God’s
prophet, he is saying. First answer the need of the stranger in your
midst. First give. Then you will find that you can’t out-give God. Then
you will discover that there will always be enough. Then you will learn
about the mystery of abundance.
Our senior adult minister, Jessica Capps, and I were visiting an elderly
widow woman this week in an assisted-living facility. She has been a
friend and a faithful Wilshire member for many years. She wanted to get
her affairs in order and talk about her funeral plans, that sort of thing.
We reminisced for a while, the way you can do when you are as lucky as
I am to be the pastor of a church for more than a quarter of a century.
And then I asked her if she had any regrets, anything we might pray for
her about. She said she regretted that she hadn’t been giving as
generously as she would have liked to, and she confessed that it had to
do with fear. I asked her why. She said she was worried that her money
would run out, but it bothered her to think that way. Then she told me
that she had shared her fear about running out of money with her son.
He immediately called his wife, who looks after the money for her
mother-in-law. He asked her how much money his mother had.
She told him, and he reported the amount to his mother, who was
shocked to hear how much there was. She wondered how that could be.
And then he confided to her that for many years, he and his wife had
been contributing secretly to her retirement account so that she could
continue to give and live as she wanted to and her money would never
run out. 
5
You see, in the circle of life, she had given generously to them, and now
they were giving generously to her. In this way, they were sharing in the
mystery of abundance by their mutual giving. Tears welled up in her
eyes as she told us the story. I believe I know what those tears meant:
gratitude for her children was filling her heart, and thanksgiving was
rising up to God at the same time.
And the jar of meal was not emptied, neither did the jug of oil fail,
according to the word of the Lord that he spoke by Elijah.
You will be enriched in every way for your great generosity, which will
produce thanksgiving to God though us.
I don’t know everything I want to know about God, but I do know that
God is a generous God. You simply can’t outgive God. But the mystery of
God’s abundance can be known only through a faith that gives even in
the face of fear. Amen. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",11/22/2015,
"We’ve come to the final sermon in a five-part series on The Once
and Future Baptist Church: A Challenge for Our Time. The truth is,
this has been a challenge every time: how to conceive of what
makes an authentic church of Jesus Christ.
The traditional answer is to cite the four adjectives in the Nicene
Creed: one, holy, catholic and apostolic. Baptists have no objection
to that, although we have interpreted each of these in somewhat
different ways from other denominations across the years.
Regrettably, the net effect of difference has been distance. We
have argued our way away from one another. We have been more
intent on proving who’s right and who’s wrong than on showing
that who’s right and wrong is secondary to our deeper covenant
of grace that binds us together in the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
This week I was at a retreat in San Antonio of about 30 pastors in
the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. We do not all see alike on
everything—we are Baptists, don’t you know?!, but we have
managed to love each other unconditionally and work together
cooperatively. Our executive coordinator, Suzii Paynter, reiterated
one of her consistent challenges: You can be alone or you can be a
fellowship.
I have been saying in these sermons that the time has come for us
Baptists also to be in fellowship with other Christians. We don’t
have to compromise the essentials of faith to do so; in fact, we
have to focus on those essentials.
An otherwise undistinguished 17th-century Lutheran theologian
put it well: In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; in all
things, charity.1 Our problems as Baptists are problems shared by
all denominations: we tend to elevate non-essentials to essentials,
and we neglect the command to make charity—that is, love—the
overriding virtue that characterizes the Church. Love binds all things in perfect harmony, Paul says in Colossians. Love works to
bring unity. Love works through differences to find what we have
in common. Love spends itself finding out how to accept and
include rather than how to reject and exclude.
We’ve lived long enough casting aspersions on fellow Christians
inside our own Baptist churches and certainly toward other
Christians. That’s unbecoming of the gospel, and it undermines
the affirmation of faith that says the true church is one, holy,
catholic and apostolic. So if you want to know what my agenda is
for this series of sermons, let me summarize: While the once
Baptist church spent its energies distinguishing itself FROM other
Christians, the future Baptist church should spend its energies
distinguishing itself AMONG other Christians. We should look to
contribute our part to the larger Church rather than pulling away
from the larger Church.
The last adjective we look at today—apostolic—is one of our best
opportunities to do just that. Baptists specialize in being apostolic.
It’s in our very DNA. But it’s going to take some work to convince
other Christians that our understanding this concept can unite us.
And it’s going to take some work on our part to accept that their
understanding of apostolic need not divide us.
So first let’s look how episcopal denominations view the matter.
The word episcopal means “of or relating to a bishop.” The
relevant denominations include Roman Catholic, Orthodox,
Lutheran, Episcopal and Methodists, among others. These
churches view the rulers of the church as the definers of what it
means to be an apostolic church. Jesus gave Peter and the other
apostles authority to govern the church. And when they died, that
authority passed to others whom they had laid hands on and
ordained to take their place. So as one Catholic writer says, Any
entity or body claiming to be the Church of Christ would have to be
able to demonstrate its apostolicity by demonstrating an organic
link with the original apostles on whom Christ manifestly
established his Church. Nothing less than this could qualify as the
""apostolic"" Church which Jesus founded. Now Baptists do assert an organic link with the original apostles,
but in a different way than having clergy who exist in an unbroken
chain of authority for 2,000 years. Because of this view, the
Catholic Church cannot consider Baptists to be formally part of
the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church, since we don’t
recognize the binding authority of the pope and the other bishops
of the church. The Catholic Church calls us ecclesial communities,
which is a kind work-around to acknowledge that we are fellow
Christians but outside the one and only true Catholic Church.
We don’t have to agree with this judgment, but here’s something
we can do: we can see the Catholics’ ordained spiritual leaders as
legitimate signs of apostolicity without making it the whole
definition. Once granting that, we may then offer a different
approach that we can all accept.
Baptists define apostolic by the very meaning of the word. Apostle
means “one who is sent.” It doesn’t mean “one who rules.” It has to
do with obedience to the Great Commission more than obedience
to human superiors. What we Baptists have to contribute to the
larger church is a passionate acceptance of our missionary
character.
We believe that what it means to be apostolic is to see ourselves
standing before Jesus as the disciples did in their day and hearing
him give us the selfsame commission to go and make disciples of
all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the
Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to observe all things
that he commanded them. We are an apostolic church when we
are a missionary church. Apostles are sent ones, and an apostolic
church is preoccupied with going into all the world and
announcing the good news of Jesus Christ.
You see, the problem with making the apostolic concept about
guarding our creeds and deeds in order to keep the church in
order is that we end up being a defensive church. We will always
be looking for what’s wrong, for who our enemies are, for the
latest threat to our existence. Instead we should be focused on
people, on being a light to the nations, on sharing the good news
of Jesus that God is not counting our sins against us, on being
ambassadors of reconciliation, on daring to be peacemakers, on 
 4
welcoming strangers, and on living winsome lives of generosity
and hospitality. When we do that, then we are apostolic.
Even Baptists had to come around to this view. For nearly the first
two centuries of our existence, we were more interested in
defining ourselves by what we were not than by what we were.
This is normal for any movement that breaks off from others at
the start. But in 1792 a simple Christian cobbler named William
Carey asked in a published tract whether [the] Commission given
by our Lord to his Disciples be not still binding on us. The prevailing
view of his time was that the Great Commission was fulfilled by
the apostles in their generation and that if God intends the
salvation of the heathen, [God] will some way or other bring them to
the gospel, or the gospel to them.3 Carey and other Baptists started
asking whether they themselves were not the way God would do
so. And so the modern missions movement began with Baptists.
Ann and Adoniram Judson answered the call and went to Burma.
Their labors there seemed fruitless at first, but today we have
Burmese Christians who are members of our church and are
studying for the ministry. Southern Baptists were always at their
best when they were focused on being a missionary people and
not becoming a theologically doctrinaire denomination. When the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship started 25 years ago, we were not
only reacting against that fundamentalism; we were fueled by a
desire to reach people in the world with the gospel that no one
had reached before and to do work among the twenty poorest
cities in the world and the twenty poorest counties in the United
States.
Wilshire has been working in the neglected Mississippi Delta. We
have been working to build a middle class in the Dominican
Republic by using Christian disciplines and sound small- business
practices. We are working in Peru and North Africa and also here
through Gateway of Grace with refugees who have come seeking
safe harbor. We are helping the Gaston Christian Center to
incubate new churches and ministries. I could go on and on. And
we want to go on and on. So what else can Wilshire do to call the whole Church of Jesus
Christ to a more missionary definition of what it means to be an
apostolic church?
First we can renew our missionary zeal. So much of our 20/20
Vision is focused on how to accelerate our mission work. We can’t
allow ourselves to become content with being a church for
ourselves. If the gospel has changed us on the inside, it will move
us to work for change on the outside. We want everyone to know
the life-changing, world-changing grace of Christ.
We need all hands on deck to do that. And that means being an
inclusive church. Not for the sake of being inclusive, but because
we can’t be pulling people into the church with one hand and
pushing people away with the other. Immigrants and migrants
and refugees are coming to us these days. We have to throw out
the welcome mat of the church to anyone and everyone, whoever
they are and wherever they come from. Who is to say that God is
not giving us an opening for witness that is not about whether you
are from this nation or that, but whether you are part of the
transnational kingdom of God?
Then we have to not only open our hearts to people and open our
mouths in witness but also to open our wallets in generosity to
fund this missionary enterprise.
When you give to this church, what’s the mental picture you have
of what your gifts go to? If your imagination is focused on paying
the light bill or seeing to it that I get paid, you are only halfway
there. You are giving to the church, yes, but more than that, you
are giving through the church.
You and I can’t be everywhere at once to make the church an
effective missional agent in the world. But through our generous
giving, we can support many others who are giving their lives to
others in the name of Christ. The missional church can be
everywhere; the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church can be
everywhere at once when we give and give and give again.
Blake Tommey grew up in our church. He heard the call to
ministry here. He is the student minister now at the University of
Virginia. He also writes for the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship 
 6
magazine. This week he told about a fifth-grade girl named Estera
in Bucharest, Romania. She attends the Ruth School, which was
started by our CBF missionaries. Estera loves to read, and her
favorite story in the Bible is the parable of the lost sheep. She can
relate. She is from the Roma people, the Gypsies. They are hated
everywhere. But when she reads that story of the shepherd who
leaves the ninety-nine sheep and goes after the one lost one, she
knows that God is the kind of God who goes after lost things, who
looks for and after those who have been cast away or fallen
through the cracks—those like Estera.4 That’s what you should
think of when the plate is passed. Think of Estera and how the
church is apostolic only when it is the missional church.
Not everything about who Baptists once were needs to change in
the future Baptist church. But we all must change if we are to join
the whole church of Jesus Christ throughout the world in pointing
the way to life. 
",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",11/8/2015,
"One of my favorite memories of an otherwise terrible tragedy a
was the Ebola crisis—which led to the death of Eric Duncan and
the 21-day quarantine of Louise Troh and the three boys—was
something the Catholic bishop of Dallas said. You remember that
during the quarantine, Louise, her son Timothy and her nephews
Oliver and Jeffrey were secretly housed in a Catholic retreat
center in Oak Cliff. When everyone else was finding a way to say
no, Bishop Kevin Farrell said yes. On the day the family left
quarantine, the media asked him why he did it, since none of them
was Catholic. He said, We didn’t do it because they are Catholic; we
did it because we are Catholic.
I love that. But the truth is, even the church that goes by the name
Catholic has work to do to become truly catholic. And certainly we
do, too.
Today is All Saints Sunday. And it’s the fourth in the series of
sermons I am preaching on The Once and Future Baptist Church.
Christians all over the globe will share communion during
worship. On this day in particular, some of them will be doing
what we did earlier—that is, remembering that the church
includes the saints we see and those we don’t. Among those we
don’t see are those who are not present with us in this sanctuary
but are present in some other sanctuary in the world. Others we
don’t see but who share communion with us are those who are
absent from the body but present with the Lord. They are not
somewhere far away; they are in heaven, which is the place where
God is, the invisible world that is more here than there. Heaven
and earth are the words we use for the full extent of created
reality. And the church exists in both realms.
So we are a communion of all saints—a church of the living and
the dead. Of course, even saying it that way is not quite true to our
faith. We are really only a church of the living, but the living 
2
includes those who are alive in Christ right now but who are
physically dead to us. So when we talk about the catholic church
(small “c,” don’t you know?!), we are talking about all the people
of God—past, present and future; here, there and everywhere—
who make up the body of Christ universal.
Now about the saints invisible among us—we called some of their
names earlier. Some wrongly assume that Roman Catholics and
others pray to saints, but actually they only ask them to pray to
God with and for us. And this seems reasonable, since why should
we imagine that those who are alive in Christ are doing nothing in
heaven right now but waiting?
Now I know that just saying those things sounds uncomfortably
Catholic to some of you. And that’s because for most of our
roughly 400-year history, we have defined ourselves over and
against Catholics rather than as catholic (even with a small “c”).
Here in Texas, the closer you get to the southern border with
Mexico, the more you define Baptists as whatever it means not to
be Catholic. So if Catholics have communion every Sunday,
Baptists will make sure we have it as seldom as possible in order
not to look Catholic. If Catholics have crucifixes—that is, crosses
with the dying Jesus on it—we will make sure our crosses are
empty, and maybe we won’t even have crosses at all.
When this sanctuary was built in 1966, the congregation raised
the steeple and decided to put a cross on top. That was a big deal
back then, and some people were a bit worried that it was too
Catholic of us to have a cross on our steeple. And when we
decided to name the Prayer Garden that we built some years ago
in front of the James Gallery, some of us thought calling it All
Saints Garden in order to pay tribute to those saints from among
us who had died in the Lord and were present still in spirit would
be a nice way of remembering them. But some still felt
uncomfortable that such a thing sounded too Catholic and wasn’t
appropriate for a Baptist church.
I understand. That has been our history. We did, after all, separate
from the Church of England, which had separated from the Roman 
3
Catholic Church. The Second London Confession in 1688, signed
by thirty-seven Baptist ministers, did declare that the pope is that
Antichrist, that Man of Sin, that Son of perdition. And here in
America, we taught generations of Baptists that we were the true
church and the Catholic church was a false church. In 2001 the
president of the Southern Baptist Seminary in Louisville,
Kentucky, said on Larry King Live that the pope holds a false office,
leads a false church and teaches a false gospel. No wonder we are
squeamish about the notion of catholicity.
But isn’t it time we looked deeper at this issue and saw in our
Catholic sisters and brothers the presence of Christ and the signs
of the church? And isn’t it time that we did the same with
Protestants and Pentecostals? And isn’t it time that the Catholic
Church and all others did the same for us? I mean, this has to go
both ways if we are all going to be truly catholic.
Today a Catholic Christian was welcome at the Table of the Lord
here in a Baptist church, but a Baptist Christian was not welcome
at the Table of the Lord in a Catholic church. Here’s the irony:
today the Catholic congregation would have recited the Nicene
Creed that declares the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church,
and yet they would not have communed with other Christians, yet
we who did not recite the creed because of our historical (and
sometimes hysterical) allergy to creeds practiced catholicity. Go
figure.
How might we begin to heal this brokenness? For one thing, we
can take another look at the question of where the church is to be
found. Roman Catholics claim that when Jesus said, You are the
Peter and on this rock I will build my church, Peter then and there
became the first pope, the first head of the church, with many to
follow. So when someone asks where the church is, the answer is:
wherever there is a bishop of the church, there is the church.
Baptists read that passage differently. (Did you know that
Christians sometimes interpret the Bible differently—and even
Baptists sometimes disagree with Baptists?) Baptists say that
what Jesus praised was not Peter alone but Peter’s confession of
Jesus as the Christ. We say that the church is founded upon a 
4
confession of Christ and that the church is found wherever Christ
is confessed. It’s Peter’s confession, in other words, not Peter’s
confession.
Two chapters later, Jesus promises that where two or three are
gathered in his name, he is right there with them. So the church is
found wherever Christ is found with members of his body. We
don’t need a bishop to be the church; we need only confessing
Christians gathered in Jesus’ name.
Now, here’s the rub: I like being in fellowship with many
Christians who are Catholic and Orthodox, Lutheran and
Presbyterian, Episcopal and Methodist, Baptists and nondenominationalists—you
get the idea—as long as they are kind of
like me and especially if they kind of like me. It’s harder to claim
kinship with Catholics and Orthodox, Lutheran and Presbyterian,
Episcopal and Methodists, Baptists and non-denominationalists
who aren’t kind of like me, and especially if they kind of don’t like
me. This business of being the one Body of Christ in the world is
easy when it’s about people like us and hard when it’s not. But we
don’t get to pick our family, and we don’t get to pick our family of
faith. The church is not a fraternity or a sorority or a country club
or a civic club. Wherever two or three of the strangest human
beings in the world gather in the name of Jesus, there is the
church catholic. It’s here, there and everywhere. And if we don’t
like it, tough luck—we’re stuck with each other. We don’t get to
determine for Jesus where he will be and what the church is. He
gets to decide that, and we get to abide that.
So how will we, Wilshire, work toward healing the rifts that put
the catholicity of the church in doubt?
First, we can refuse to let our disagreements with and our distaste
for other Christians extend to the point at which we dismiss them
as sisters and brothers in Christ. We need to open our hearts to
one another, even when those very others have broken our hearts
time and again. And that is true of radical fundamentalists and
radical liberals both. Sometimes they say and do things that make
me cringe. Hey, sometimes I say and do things that make them 
5
cringe. As long as we are pushing each other away, we are
working against the very things we confess about the church
being holy, catholic and apostolic. But if we learn to see Christ in
them, perhaps we will give them an opening to see Christ in us.
Then this: let’s continue to open our imagination to the whole
catholic church, which includes those who have gone before us
and live now in the presence of the Lord. Sometimes we act as if
the church is composed only of those who happen to be walking
around at this time. We forget that the church is also those who
have lived faithfully before us and are praying for us and with us
even now. We should even account for them in our decisions. We
may, for instance, ask about how they lived and handled the
challenges of their times. We may draw strength from their
examples. We may not do exactly what they did, because if they
lived in our times they might have done something different, too.
But as Chesterton said, the church that is truly catholic is the most
democratic of all institutions because it even gives a vote to the
dead.
Here’s a story about the church catholic from the year 1865.
That’s the year the Civil War ended, but like so many such
conflicts, the fact that the fighting ceases doesn’t mean that hearts
or minds are changed. So it probably was that on the first Sunday
of June in that year, communion was served at the stately St.
Paul’s Episcopal Church in Richmond, Virginia. As the minister
invited the congregation to the communion rail, a lone black man
rose and made his way from the back of the church, where the
other African Americans sat. He passed by the Virginia gentry,
who were slow to rise, and he knelt down at the railing, expecting
to be served. This had never happened before, and he had
evidently taken the news of the Union’s victory as a sign that
things would now be different. The air went out of the room. No
one moved for a long time. The minister himself froze, not
knowing what to do.
Then all at once a white-haired gentleman in a gray suit rose and
made his way to the altar. He knelt beside the black man and
nodded at the priest. Upon the example of General Robert E. Lee, 
6
who had himself only months earlier been defending the
institution of slavery in the war, the priest was released of his
fear, and the people came forward to share together in the feast of
the Lord.
There, see it? There is the church catholic. Two or three were
gathered in Christ’s name, and he was there in the midst of them.
Amen.",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",11/1/2015,
"A weird thing happened in Washington, D.C. recently. What?
Weird things happen in Washington, George? Well, this one moves
past the political to the spiritual. After Pope Francis addressed
Congress, Democratic Rep. Bob Brady of Pennsylvania ran to the
podium and snatched the Holy Father’s half-drunk glass of water
and whisked it away to his office, where he, his wife and Rep. Bob
Casey and his wife shared a sip of what they considered to be holy
water. When reminded by reporters that the tap water was not
holy in the strict Catholic sense, Brady dismissed them by saying,
Anything the Pope touches becomes blessed.1
The question of what is sacred and what is profane, and what is
holy or blessed in relation to the church, is as old as the Church
itself. We’ve made it today to the third of our five-part series on
The Once and Future Baptist Church: A Challenge for Our Time.
We’re looking particularly at the Baptist movement—where we’ve
been and where we’re going—through the lens of the four historic
marks of the larger Church. The Church is one, holy, catholic and
apostolic. Two weeks ago we looked at how we can be uniquely
Baptist and still part of the one Church with a capital C. Today we
consider what it means for the church to be holy.
The odd incident concerning the Pope’s drinking water has more
of a popular superstitious underpinning to it than even the
Catholic Church would accept. But it is true that the Catholic
Church has claimed that the Pope and ordained priests have
power to make ordinary water holy because the Church they
serve as Christ’s representatives on Earth is holy by definition.
This debate about how the Church is holy was fierce in the fourth
century in North Africa. A group called the Donatists claimed that
the true Church was composed only of saints—that is, holy ones,
not sinners. And they went so far as to say that only if you were baptized by a Donatist priest or received communion from one
could you have been validly baptized or truly have received the
body and blood of Christ in the Eucharist. This debate raged until
the eminent Bishop of Hippo, Augustine, made his defining
argument about the Church in his book The City of God. Augustine
cited a passage from Matthew 13 about how the wheat and the
weeds grow up together in the field, and while they are growing,
they look so much alike that it is futile to try to pick out the weeds
until the harvest. His point was that saints and sinners are both in
the church until the final judgment by God, who alone has the
power to tell one from the other.
This issue goes along with the Catholic Church’s baptism of infants
and calling on church members to be faithful all their lives long in
order to be counted among the holy when the judgment comes.
Augustine himself feared on his deathbed that he would not be
judged to be among the holy.
In the sixteenth century, an Augustinian monk named Martin
Luther was so tortured about his sinfulness that he confessed to
his priest to the point of wearing him out. Today we join the rest
of the Protestant world in commemorating Reformation Sunday.
On All Hallows Eve in 1517, Luther famously nailed his 95 theses
to the door of the Wittenberg church, hammering home his
protest against this spiritual insecurity, among other things.
Luther’s great insight was that the church is holy because God is
holy, not because Christians are holy. For Luther, everything came
down to God’s grace in Jesus Christ. It is Christ’s righteousness
that we receive in our relationship to him, not our righteousness
that we achieve in order to be worthy of him. Our faith is Christ’s
faith that is granted to us, because whatever Christ touches is
blessed. Whoever is in Christ is holy.
Luther said the church is not filled with sinners and saints but
with people who are sinners and saints at the same time.
Baptists came along about a century later. Luther’s ideas about
holiness being centered in relationship to Christ were carried
over to how the church is organized. Baptists were not Reformers
like Luther or Calvin; we were Separatists. The first Baptists
believed that the only way to have a holy church was for it to be
composed of holy people. And they were only holy if they were 
 3
first born again and then baptized. Baptists believe in what is
called the regenerate church; that is, the church is holy because it
is only made up of people who have been regenerated—the word
means “born again” or “born anew”—by their profession of faith
in Jesus Christ and their baptism thereafter.
The problem is what to do with those regenerate people who,
after becoming regenerate become degenerate again? What
happens when they keep sinning? Luther himself acknowledged
this problem when he said that the old man who supposedly
drowned in baptism seemed to be a pretty good swimmer.
Baptists didn’t have a tradition of confession to a priest, since we
believed all Christians were made priests, so we assumed that we
should confess our sins to one another. And the revival movement
really drove this practice home, as many would publicly
rededicate their lives to Christ at planting and harvest times again
and again.
However, this habit wasn’t enough for some Baptists, who were so
concerned about this that they believed such sinners had actually
fallen from grace. The Church of Christ movement under the
influence of Alexander Campbell and Barton Stone in the
nineteenth century split from Baptists and said that only if you
were properly baptized by a minister in a truly New Testament
church could you be saved. And if you kept on sinning, you would
have to be baptized again and again. Sounds a lot like the
Donatists, doesn’t it? What’s old is ever new, don’t you know?!
Baptists were losing so many members to the churches of Christ
that they developed their own theology of how they were the true
church. These Baptists tried to trace their holy lineage all the way
back through history in an unbroken series of landmarks of true
Baptist-like martyrs—all the way to John the Baptist himself. The
Landmark Baptist movement is what shaped some of you in your
Baptist upbringing, although you probably don’t know it. For
instance, the language of joining a church by letter came from the
idea that only if you had a letter from a Baptist church that said
you were duly baptized by a Landmark Baptist pastor could you
safely join another Baptist church without being rebaptized. Some
of you may also have grown up in a Baptist church that allowed
only members of that church to receive the Lord’s Supper. Same
movement. You see, Baptists have sometimes reshaped their 
 4
theology to stave off losing members to more-conservative
churches by inoculating the church with even-more- conservative
theology. Go figure.
I believe we need to rethink today what it means to be holy. With
Luther we can affirm that all Christians are holy—that is, saints—
in the general sense that by virtue of the work of Christ, he makes
us his own. If you have put your trust in Jesus Christ, you are
already among the saints. As Baptist Professor Curtis Freeman
puts it: When individual members fall into sin and even when as a
community it is unfaithful and in need of reformation and renewal,
the church by virtue of its union with Christ and the indwelling
presence of the Spirit remains holy. As Karl Barth observed, the
church may become a beggar, a shopkeeper, or a harlot, but it is still
and always the bride of Christ.
We are, as 1 Peter says, the people of God, a chosen race, a royal
priesthood and a holy nation. But here’s the important thing Peter
says that follows: … in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts
of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. You
see, our holiness is directly related to our purpose as the people of
God.
This is where we have so often gone wrong. We have made
holiness into something that must be constantly examined to see
whether our status is sure and our salvation assured. We have
defined holiness as sinlessness, as purity, as some kind of state of
saintliness. And too often that idea has to do with what we don’t
do rather than what we do. You know the old saw among us: a
good Baptist boy is someone who doesn’t drink or dance or chew or
go with girls who do.
But the point of purity isn’t purity any more than the point of
fitness is fitness. If you work hard to get into great shape by
watching what you eat, lifting weights and doing cardio workouts,
and all you do with that is to celebrate how great your body is and
how good you look, that’s vanity, not purity. The point of great
fitness is what it allows you to do because of it. If an athlete is out
of shape, she won’t be much good on the field or the court. The
point of self-discipline is what it allows you to accomplish with
the instrument of your body. 
 5
Likewise, spiritual fitness—let’s call it holiness—is about how
Christ-like we are becoming in order that we may participate in
God’s great mission to the world of calling those in darkness into
the light of God’s love.
With Augustine, we can leave the winnowing work to God at the
end of days and now just trust in Christ for our eternal salvation.
This approach will free us to get on with the work we share with
all other Christians of every stripe—that we proclaim the good
news.
So how can we as Wilshire Baptist Church become part of this
effort to interpret a holy church to the larger Christian
community?
First, let’s acknowledge that we are all of us sinners saved by
grace and get out of the business of trying to figure out who’s
holier than someone else. We should leave the sorting to God and
get on with the serving instead. We should focus on how each of
us can be better spiritually prepared to serve.
And that’s the second thing: as Mark Wingfield nicely put it in his
Tapestry column today, we should attend to how the gifts the Holy
Spirit has given to us can be used for holy purposes. What are
your unique gifts and passions? How can God activate them in
service in order that your purpose can be fulfilled?
An old American Express ad said, “Membership has its privileges,”
but the future Baptist church saying should be, “Membership has
its responsibilities.” Holiness is the means of achieving our
mission; it is not the mission itself.
A holy man was praying on a creek bank one day when his eye
caught a scorpion that had gotten stuck on a log trying to cross the
waters. As the waters continued to hit the small creature, the holy
man sprang to his feet, reached out his hand and freed it so that it
could make it to the other side. In the midst of the rescue
operation, the scorpion stung the holy man. A bystander noticed
the goings on and asked the holy man, Didn’t you realize that it’s
the nature of a scorpion to sting? The holy man replied, Yes, but it’s
my nature to save.
 6
Friends, as long as we are concerned with a holiness that protects
us from dangerous encounters with others, the church is not
really holy. The holy nature of the church is seen only when we
are about the work of saving. Amen. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",10/25/2015,
"This past week was the 20th anniversary of the Million Man
March. In honor of this anniversary, many gathered in
Washington D.C. However, this gathering looked vastly
different than the one in 1995. It was not a majority of black
men; this march was filled with men and women of all different
races and creeds. One of the speakers stated, ""We who are
getting older ... what good are we if we don't prepare young
people to carry that torch of liberation to the next step? What
good are we if we think we can last forever and not prepare
others to walk in our footsteps?"" Many shared their experience.
But one participant reminisced on the first march and said, “At
the start of the trip I focused on everything that I wanted
changed and thought on all the injustices that happened to me.
But, it was something about the journey to get here that I
realized it wasn’t just about me, but it is about working together
in my community. I left with the message to seek the good,
embrace it, build on it and share it.”
It was something about the journey that I realized it wasn’t all
about me.
The Gospel of Mark presents to us the same message with
similar characters, but a little different Jesus than we see in
other Gospels. John portrays a Jesus that is divine, focusing on
the signs that Jesus presents. Matthew displays a Jesus that is
the Promised Savior and the King of the Jews. Luke illustrates
Jesus as a “Perfect Man.” However, Mark gives us a servant.
In order to persuade his audience or ensure to them that this is
the Messiah, Mark strategically places in his Gospel pieces of
the “Servant Song” from the book of Isaiah.
He depicts Jesus as the one who will serve, suffer and die in
order to redeem Israel and the world–the one who will turn the
world’s ideas of power and glory upside down and inside out
through the works of the kingdom of God. If that’s not enough, 
2
in almost every encounter that Jesus has, there are undertones
of service. No matter how many implications Mark gives, it
seems as if those participating in the story don’t get it and
neither do those reading it.
We must understand that the Gospel of Mark is not just a
narrative of one servant, but the making of servants, which is
seen in great detail in today’s passage.
There is something about this journey to Jerusalem, something
about the walk on this winding road that’s gets James and John
thinking. I’m sure for most of the trip James and John went
back and forth on deciding if they should approach him or not. If
so, what would they say and how would they say it? All of a
sudden James and John call a rest break, making the excuse
that they are hungry, thirsty, and just tired of tripping on rocks.
In the midst of this break, they pull Jesus to the side away from
all the other disciples in order to whisper a command in his ear.
I wonder what causes these two brothers to bring this
command to Jesus.
Maybe it is the long walk with the Middle Eastern sun beating
down on their scalps. Maybe it was due to their own
insecurities. See, they have been with Jesus for some years
now. At the beginning of those years they were the top dogs,
they were the chosen ones that left all their belongings to follow
Christ.
During their time with Jesus they witnessed a leper with tears in
his eyes, asking Jesus to make him clean. And they watched as
Jesus stretched out his hand saying to him, “I’m willing.” They
saw power leave Jesus after the woman with the issue of blood
touches him. They even observed Jesus grant the request of
unclean spirits. Over and over, they encountered Jesus
restoring those that were deemed as outcast and fulfilling their
desires.
Not once after the disciples are “called” does Jesus turn to
them and grant their wishes and desires. Could it be that James
and John felt even less than the leper? I wonder if they ask this 
3
question because deep down they are unsure of themselves,
deep down they don’t believe they are valued and loved.
Isn’t this a reason why we would ask the question? Like the
Disciples, we might think the closer to Christ we are, the more
glory we would gain. Even thinking the first and the best
blessings will be ours. But as soon as we notice it isn’t working
the way we want it to, we move into the theory that maybe
Jesus doesn’t love me like I think he does. I wonder if he really
cares that I gave up everything to be with him because all the
leper had to do was come to him and he was blessed.
Maybe they ask this question out of fear. Jesus has just told
them for the third time of his death and resurrection. Possibly,
James and John finally figured something out. This meant the
one who took a chance on them, the one who believed in them
won’t be with them much longer. It’s the fear that once he
leaves, things would go back to the way they were. And James
and John would go back to pulling out empty nets in a sea full
of fish. I am sure they thought, “If I can’t have him for the rest of
my life here on earth, if I can’t be next to him, or be in the midst
of his greatness, surely, I can reserve my spot with him in
glory.”
When Jesus hears this command, he does not start back
walking and let them figure it out on the day of his crucifixion.
Rather, Jesus decides to turn this into a teaching moment and
asked two questions “Are you able to drink the cup that I drink,
or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” James
and John responded with an immediate “yes.”
Yes? Something doesn’t add up. The request they ask of Jesus
and the response they give to his question don’t go together.
See, their request was to have power and greatness, but their
resounding “yes” to Jesus was agreeing to be less than.
It is clear from their actions that James and John didn’t
understand that glory was not a future place but a future event.
Glory in Jesus’ terms would mean that the Son of Man would
be mocked, spat upon, beaten and killed. The Son of Man
would not be sitting on a throne, but hanging from a cross. 
4
Neither of his closest companions would be on his left or on his
right.
When Jesus speaks of the cup and baptism, he is speaking of
his death. Salvation could not come without the suffering on the
cross and resurrection cannot come unless one has been
buried. While Jesus cannot make the reservations for who will
sit on his right and on his left, he does allow them to drink from
the same cup and share in his baptism. So what does Jesus
grant them? Because of their following and closeness, he
allows them to share in his suffering.
We know this story. Not because we have skimmed it to get to
the “Blind Bartimaeus” story, which if we are honest, is a cooler
story. And not because this passage comes along every 3
years with the lectionary cycle. We know this story because we
have lived it. We are James and John; their DNA is within all of
us.
For some reason, we also make demands to Christ for things
we “need” and desires we want fulfilled.
We live in a world that constantly tells us there is just not
enough. There is only a right or a left and that is not enough
seats for all of us. There isn’t enough money and there aren’t
enough resources. How can I look out for someone else when
there is barely enough for me? We even begin to see the world
as grounds to conquer and people to rule over because it
seems that we have the mindset that there isn’t even enough
love for my neighbor.
Furthermore, we partake in a culture that has constantly told us
greatness resides in the possessions we have, the amount of
trophies we put on the mantle and even the accomplishments
we obtain.
The truth is, in the midst of our insecurities and fears, we crave
power, greatness, authority and even glory. These desires
become the aloe that soothes the fears and the Band-Aid that
covers insecurities. 
5
What Jesus does in this passage for the disciples and even for
you and me, is not only redefine greatness, but also define one
of the essential purposes of human beings—to serve one
another just as the Son of Man came and served. To serve
defines greatness. It is part of our human identity; it is part of
our Christian character.
We have been told all our lives, “serve ye one another.” But
have we done it?
One of my theology professors at Yale, Kathryn Tanner, wrote,
“[Because God is powerful, divine, and perfect] God may not
need anything from us, but the world does.” The world needs us
to be Christ within it. The world needs ordinary people like you
and me who are “willing to walk like Jesus, talk like Jesus,
serve like Jesus, and even suffer like Jesus.” When we do, we
find ourselves in the margins serving the marginalized. We
become a voice for the voiceless and encourage them to have
power to speak. We even find ourselves reaching out to the
outcast and reminding them that Christ served, suffered, died
and rose again for them as well.
There’s something about the journey—the journey of life, the
journey of denying ourselves, the picking up of our crosses and
following Christ. For in this journey the hope is that we learn it is
not about fulfilling our own individual desires, but in having the
desire to serve each other.
On Friday, members from our church, as well as other
churches, left for a mission trip in Collique, Peru to work with
the organization known as OSA (Operación San Andrés). The
first mission trip to Peru happened in 2003 with 16 participants
including doctors, dentists and nurses who went throughout the
poorest cities, offering medical services. In 2005, OSA bought
their first piece of property. It was bare, but filled with visions
and dreams. Each season, volunteers would make their way to
Collique to build, bring medical services, or offer their Godgiven
talents to those in the city.
One of the founding members of this organization is Dr. Luis
Campos. He is a native Peruvian and also has relatives in this
congregation. In an interview Dr. Campos stated, “I thought that 
6
bringing medical attention was the most important aspect of
these trips, but I found out that I was wrong. What came to be
the most important act was giving them a hope, a new way of
looking at the world. A way that would free them from the
oppression of poverty.” Recently, OSA finished the construction
of a church on their property. While the people in Collique have
a place to worship or a place to avoid on Sunday mornings,
they also now have a place that serves as a symbol of hope.
Some things you can’t learn without going on the journey and
you surely won’t learn them if Jesus isn’t on the journey with
you.
Y’all, the world needs us; it needs us to be Jesus within it. As
Christians, if our call is to serve God and to serve one another,
then we should take Barbara Brown Taylor’s advice and
change James’ and John’s statement from “Teacher, we want
you to do for us whatever we ask of you” to “Teacher, we want
to do for you whatever you ask of us.”
Amen.",Timothy Peoples,"Dallas, TX",10/18/2015,
"This past week I found myself in the Halloween store across the
street. I like walking through the aisles looking at all the
outrageous costumes.
Each year there is always one aisle dedicated to superheroes
and another aisle dedicated to Disney princesses. I
remembered that as a child I was one of the few girls who were
in the superhero aisle. I wanted to be Batman or Superwoman
or even the Hulk.
Growing up with two brothers, I was encouraged to ditch the
dress for the cape and mask. Today, I still prefer the blue-faced
hero from Braveheart over the redheaded princess from
Disney’s Brave.
Deep down we all want to be the heroine or the hero of our
story.
This is where we find the disciples James and John. They want
to be heroes like Jesus.
These two brothers have been with Jesus since the beginning.
They were the first disciples called by Jesus. But at this point in
their journey, they are disappointed with their hero. Their
expectations of Jesus’ role are not lining up with the direction
that Jesus is going. By the end of Mark chapter ten, Jesus has
twice told about his death and resurrection. He, along with the
disciples, have left Galilee and turned towards Jerusalem.
Jesus is walking briskly on the road ahead with his disciples
lagging behind confused and afraid.
For Jesus is leading them in a dangerous direction. They have
already seen far too many crucifixions on this road and the
disciples know there are deadly people waiting for Jesus in
Jerusalem.
As they are walking, Jesus once again speaks about his future
suffering, death and resurrection. The disciples are scared. Their powerful superhero is choosing to be vulnerable and
weak.
Choosing to be vulnerable in a world that runs over the weak is
terrifying.
Jesus calls us all to be vulnerable, to be weak, to be brave.
In our society, being brave means using our superpowers when
we lose control of our world.
James’ and John’s lives are out of control. They are heading to
Jerusalem led by their leader who keeps telling them he is
going to die and his followers will die too.
Death does not seem like a heroic victory.
Dying doesn’t compute in our superhero mentality. We all want
to fight the good fight and come out on top – flying victoriously
above the world.
We want to conquer the evil rulers of this world with our
superhuman power. We want the mask and the cape that give
us an addicting dose of heroism.
But this is not the way of Christ.
Jesus came not as a superhero but as a simple human.
If Jesus is embracing his humanity than why are we not doing
the same?
The words of Jesus are difficult to hear. “Whoever wishes to be
first among you must be slave of all.”
Earlier in Mark, Jesus takes a child into his arms telling his
followers that they must become nothing in order to be
something. This feels upside down in our world –
counterintuitive. Jesus is not saving the world by zooming across the universe
with a lightsaber in hand. No, being brave in Jesus’ world is
kneeling down, holding a child.
He is like a parent who has their bachelor’s and master’s
degrees sitting down at their daughter’s tiny table having tea in
tiny teacups, wearing a princess tiara.
Is this what you deserve after all your education and all your
hard work?
James and John have been slaving away in Jesus’ ministry and
they feel like they deserve a well-earned position of prestige.
They have worked the longest in God’s vineyard so they should
get the most pay.
Jesus responds, “You will get the same thing I get – a life full of
ups and downs, a life with difficult seasons where you will be
helpless and vulnerable. But most of all you will get me.”
What we actually get from Jesus is Jesus. We get to live this
life with Jesus giving us courage each step of the way.
Jesus is calling us to live vulnerable lives with courage.
But in order for us to be brave in Jesus’ world, we have to let go
of all pride and all ego.
I find truth in the theme song from Frozen.
You know the one that Princess Elsa sings, the song that
continues to be sung by every child in America. This is the song
I actually wanted as our Hymn of Commitment today.
But do you know we all eventually have to let it go? We have to
let go of control, let go of our narcissism and superego.
We all want what the Zebedee brothers are asking Jesus for –
a place of privilege in God’s kingdom. I wonder: who are the people we want to sit next to? Who do
we want to be seen with because it gives us more power or
higher self-esteem?
But then I think about who Jesus was always sitting next to.
Prostitutes, tax collectors, lepers and liars.
Who SHOULD we be sitting next to?
James and John desire a high place of honor. But in Jesus’
mind, a high place of honor is kneeling down to wash
someone’s feet or writing in the sand.
Jesus knows that James and John do not wish to be mounted
high, nailed to cross like the two criminals who will be beside
him on Calvary.
These greedy sons of Zebedee do not know what they are
asking. In their narcissism, they unknowingly fall prey to irony.
They have seen all the miracles, heard all the parables and yet
they cannot understand the truth of following Jesus. The Son of
Man will die and you are along for the ride.
To them, the Son of Man is the next up-and-coming ruling
power that will overthrow Caesar and the Roman Empire. They
want a hero to save not a hero enslaved.

But Jesus who came from above is bringing salvation from
below. He came not to be served but to serve.
Ironically, their question to Jesus mirrors the rash offer King
Herod makes to his daughter on her birthday. “Ask whatever of
me and it shall be given to you.” Well, Herod’s daughter
requested the head of John the Baptist. The Zebedee brothers
unwittingly position themselves alongside the very rulers who
executed righteous teachers.
In their efforts to be on the right side of history, their attitude
gets flipped upside down. It is difficult to see the truth in a world that is always tilting you
upside down.
It’s like trying to eat a Fletcher’s corn dog while flipped around
on the Tilt-A-Whirl ride at the State Fair.
But God is always in the process of putting the world right-side
up. Like all of us, these brothers desire control but fall prey to
self-serving behavior.
People think that superheroes are selfless but they really are
just self-serving.
Our egos can trick our minds into thinking we have the ability in
our own strength, our own knowledge, our own power to save
the world. But this is a false sense of selflessness.
As religious people, this began in Genesis chapter three with
the fall of humanity. Other fields of study like psychology
interpret this self-absorbed behavior through Maslow’s
hierarchy of needs, Erikson’s stages of development or even
Freud’s ego or id impulses.
Whatever name you call it, this self-serving behavior lives within
all of us.
Jana Childers, Dean of San Francisco Theological Seminary,
says, “We all have Zebedee DNA in our genes.” Sooner or
later we all have to face our tendencies to be a son or daughter
of Zebedee.
If we truly want the world to be saved, we must dare to kneel
down instead of propping ourselves up.
This is the paradox of the Kingdom of God – it feels illogical at
times.
Like when you look deep into the mirror at your reflection, past
the ego, past the pride until you can see the shadow side of your heart. It’s dark, painful and messy. But then you also see
Christ turning your heart right-side up.
You realize that you don’t have to save the world because
somebody else already has.
Like Christ we are not called to be heroes of the world; we are
called to be healers in the world. Healers use their own
redemption to bring forth change in the world.
In his book, Wounded Healer, Henri Nouwen writes, “Only
those who face their wounded condition can be available for
healing and so enter a new way of living, a journey towards
wholeness.”
Wholeness is becoming last in order to become first.
Wholeness is serving out of our own healing and love through
Christ Jesus who brings forth salvation. Jesus is our model of
wholeness.
This is the cup we drink, the baptism we experience. The cup of
salvation is the self-sacrificing drink offered by Christ.
Like the cup, baptism is a vulnerable act, an act of faith. To be
plunged underneath the water at the mercy of another, trusting
that you will be lifted up once again.
By both the cup and baptism, we lose ourselves and yet find
ourselves more fully.
This healing and wholeness gives us courage to follow Christ
into the depths of our own hearts. This is where courage is
found – in our own humility and vulnerability.
In my earlier years of ministry I lost my courage. I was serving
in a struggling church that I could not save.
One Sunday morning I found myself weeping in the women’s
bathroom. I was tired, I was frustrated and I was scared about
the future of this church that I loved so much. Everything I did to help seemed useless. What was point of
pastoring if I couldn’t save the church?
I finally composed myself and put my pastor cape back on
using my mask to cover my tear-swollen eyes. Then I walked
into the sanctuary and saw a familiar mother with her little fouryear-old
girl named Beth.
I remembered the first time I met Beth. She touched my red
curly hair and said I looked like the Disney princess Merida
from the movie Brave.
So during this difficult morning, she saw me across the
Sanctuary. Running towards me with arms opened wide she
shouted, “Brave!”
My hero’s heart melted to mush. Maybe I don’t have to save the
church. Maybe I just have to kneel down and be brave for one
little girl.
We all want to wear the cape and the mask. But take courage
when you’re at home raising a family, at work running your
business or caring for your elderly parent or spouse. This is
how we serve from below – how we must die in order to fully
live.
It takes courage to die – to let go of power and control. But
remember that we serve a God of resurrection – a God who
gives courage.
Being brave is not asking for a cape and a mask but simply
asking for Jesus. Now we can say to the world. “You may have
all the rest, just give me Jesus.” Amen. ",Erica Whitaker,"Dallas, TX",10/18/2015,
"Listen carefully and see if you can tell me what ONE word seems
most important in Paul’s words and Jesus’ words …
Jesus first (Jesus is always first, don’t you know?!): The glory that
you have given me I have given them, so that they may be one, as we
are one, I in them and you in me, that they may become completely
one …
Paul next: There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called
to the one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all and in
all.
That’s a whole lot of oneness. Seems pretty important for Jesus
and Paul to talk about the oneness of the church. Why isn’t more
important to us?
We began last week a series of sermons on The Once and Future
Baptist Church. And today we look at the first of the four
traditional marks of the church over time. The church is one, holy,
catholic and apostolic. And what I am saying about the Baptist
church of the future is that it will need to lean into these historic
identifiers if it is to renew itself within the whole Church that is
the body of Christ.
For us Baptists, part of the problem with the oneness of the
church stems from the circumstances of our birth. We came into
being in the early 17th Century in England. We were one among
many groups that mourned the corruption of the Church of
England. Some were Puritans who never wanted to leave the
mother church but committed to “purifying” it. Baptists were
more radical. We were separatists who said that the Church of
England couldn’t be saved because it rested on a false alliance
with secular powers. As long as church and state were united, the
church would never truly be the church of the New Testament. We
were called dissenters. And we honed our dissenter identity. We 
 2
became good at it. Everywhere we went, we pointed out what was
wrong with other churches.
This little ditty one of our members sent to me this week
represents that critical spirit. This man’s grandfather was a
Baptist preacher who bequeathed the poem to his grandson. In an
act of delicious irony, one of his grandfather’s parishioners added
the last verse that turns the finger-pointing back on us.
I had rather be a Baptist with faith, love and hope
Than be a Roman Catholic taking orders from the Pope.
I had rather be a Baptist and with my Savior go
Than be an Episcopalian with all their pomp and show.
I had rather be a Baptist rejoicing every hour
Than be a Presbyterian and never feel the power.
I had rather be a Baptist and have a beaming face
Than be a Methodist and afraid I’d fall from grace.
I had rather be a Baptist and know that I am right
Than trust in the water and be a Campbellite.
Now here comes the rejoinder from the pew …
I had rather be a Christian and know that I am right
Than be one of those narrow-minded Baptists always
in a fight.
I often tell people in marriage counseling: You have to decide if
you would rather be right or be married. The need to be right
ends in a fight. It turns love into a contest of wills over who gets to
define the relationship.
And that’s what’s happened with our many churches. Instead of
starting from an assumption of oneness that we get from Jesus
and Paul, we broke off into our separate churches and claimed
we’re the one true church. If you want to be in the one true
church, join ours because we have it right.
This was the problem with our practice of baptism for many
years. We said that in looking at the New Testament, it seemed 
 3
that baptism always followed belief by those who were able to
make that decision for themselves. And frankly, I think we are
right about that. Amazingly though, since 1988 the Roman
Catholic Church has said that the normative pattern for adult
initiation into the Church is by the conversion of the person
before baptism rather than after infant baptism. Here’s how they
put it: The Church recognizes that conversion is a free gift from God
which must be nurtured, supported and allowed to grow with the
help of the Spirit until the individual is ready to take the final step of
professing his or her faith and becoming a Catholic.
In other words, they agree with us at last! Now don’t jump up and
down too quickly: they aren’t building baptismal pools in their
sanctuaries. Although some are. St. Joseph’s Catholic Church in
Richardson, for instance, where my old friend Monsignor Don
Fischer served for some time until his retirement, has one. Now,
they don’t usually practice baptism our way, but still this is a sign
of how we can grow toward each other. Reciprocally, while we
continue only to baptize in the way we do, we now acknowledge
and receive confessing Christians from other denominations who
were baptized in other ways. You see, we can hold our convictions
and be generous at the same time. All of which moves us closer to
the answer of Jesus’ prayer that we all be one, and closer to Paul’s
claim that there is only one baptism.
But how should we think of this oneness? Our children’s minister,
Julie Girards, was telling me about a conference speaker last week
who put up a picture of a tiger in a jungle. She asked the group
what they saw and they all said they saw a tiger. Then she made
the point that in many cultures when this picture is shown, the
people say they see a jungle. They see the whole first, not the part.
This would help if we could begin to see the whole church. You
see, when all we see is a part of the church, we foster the feeling
that we are apart from the one church because we are by
ourselves the one church. But as my friend and colleague Curtis
Freeman likes to say, the local church is wholly the church but it is
not the whole Church. 
 4
Jesus says the oneness of the Church is grounded in the oneness of
the divine love of Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The triune persons
live in and through one another. The Father is not the Son and the
Son is not the Father, but the Father is not the Father without the
Son and the Son is not the Son without the Father. Likewise, with
the Spirit. They are altogether one, because they are all together.
Jeremy Begbie was in Dallas the other night and made a beautiful
point of how to look at this oneness. Begbie teaches music and
theology at both Cambridge in England and at Duke. He said that
when we try to imagine the Trinity, our head hurts because we
always use visual images for it. The problem is that it ends up
making it look like God is either one in three parts or three gods.
The three can’t occupy the same space at the same time without
each diminishing the others.
But what if we considered the world of sound? Jeff, help me here.
[Organist plays on cue.] Play a note for the Father. Now play a
note for the Son. And one for the Spirit. Great. Three notes, three
different colors (as organists like to call these families of sounds).
But now Jeff, play the same three notes together as a chord.
Beautiful. Do you hear it? Each note is still itself. And each note
occupies one and the same world of hearing as the others. But
now they are more together than they were apart. Each supports
the other and the one sound they produce from their three unique
sounds is a unity in diversity.
This is what we should be aiming for in our efforts to live into the
claim of our truly being one church. Baptists don’t need to stop
being Baptists or Lutherans Lutheran or Methodists Methodist or
Catholics Catholic (you can name them all). But we should be able
to look through the different churches to see the whole Church. If
we offer ourselves generously to each other and receive each
other hospitably, we will produce a oneness that will point the
world to a new way of unity.
The world we live in is socially dysfunctional. You can see it in our
politics right now. Whether liberal or conservative, each thinks
they have the solution and the other simply needs to give in. The 
 5
problem is that we have a common life to live that doesn’t bow to
the left or right. And the world doesn’t have the vocabulary for
what we have in common, only for what we have in difference. So
think about this: if the church that is the one body of Christ in
diversity and is grounded in the life of the one God who is three
persons cannot find a way to show forth our unity, who will the
world turn to to learn it? The hope of human unity is in spiritual
unity, not the other way round.
What can we do then to help make the future Baptist church one
that makes visible the oneness of the whole Church?
First, we can believe in our hearts what Jesus and Paul
understood: there is only one church, and no one congregation or
denomination is the one Church without all the others. We can
make a commitment to look at other churches as sister
congregations that make up the one body of Christ instead of
competitors to the title of the One True Church. The oneness of
the church is a fact hidden in the life of God. It’s not up to us to
make the church one; it’s up to us to show it is so.
Then this: we can move from a mode of being Baptist that is
always and only dissenting, to one that’s including and assenting.
We need to say what we are for and not only say what we are
against. And we need to stand with the rest of the church in all its
imperfections, not just stand apart from it and point out its flaws.
A wounded man in a war-worn uniform was sitting beside a river.
He wanted to cross but lacked the coinage for the ferry. A group of
soldiers came
to the shore to board several tied-up boats. The man pulled
himself up and inched his way toward one of the men and asked if
he could catch a ride. When they disembarked, one of the soldiers
caught up with him and asked how he had the brass to approach
the President of the United States, Andrew Jackson, for a ride.
I didn't know anything about him being President, he said. All I
know is that some people have a 'yes' face and some have a 'no' face.
He had a 'yes' face.
 6
I don’t know about you, but I want our church and all churches to
have a ‘yes’ face toward the world. I want the world to look at us
and see welcome for sinners and hope of salvation. I want other
churches to look through us and see the whole of the beautiful
body of Christ they share in with us.
If that’s the Baptist church of the future you want to see, come
along with us and make it so. Amen. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",10/11/2015,
"God is always calling us to be more than we have been.
That’s what Loren Mead said in his landmark 1991 book The Once
and Future Church. Mead was a church consultant who could see
the need for a great congregational renewal in the American
church.
The situation is even more dire today than it was a quarter
century ago. Church attendance is down all across North America.
Denominations are splitting and splintering. People are either
losing faith altogether or losing faith in the church and opting out.
Many still claim to be Christians, but they have had it with the
church.
Baptists have seen this situation ourselves. Southern Baptists
have recently announced that they have used up all the reserves
they can spare, and they will reduce their missionary force around
the world by up to 800 people. The number of new converts to
Christ who are baptized has been dropping steadily for years,
especially if you do not include the baptisms of children who have
grown up in the church. Don’t think I am pointing only to
Southern Baptists; we Cooperative Baptists are faring no better.
Every large church in our group is seeing fewer people in the
pews week by week. We see it here at Wilshire, too. Although we
have maintained a vital and vibrant church, it takes about 50
percent more people being involved today than it did 25 years ago
to maintain the same attendance.
Some churches have reacted to this development by changing
their style of worship, looking for a magic strategy that will
compel more people to be engaged and grow the church again.
That approach usually creates more conflict than growth. All of
these changes have church leaders everywhere asking themselves
about whether there will be a church for our children and
grandchildren someday like the church we have known. And most
of us have to honestly say no; there won’t be a church like what
we have known. 
 2
But in the midst of all this, I have to tell you that I am hopeful. I
believe in God. I believe the Spirit is at work giving birth to a new
church in this midst of these developments. I believe the body of
Christ will stand at the end of time. And I believe Wilshire can be a
key agent in the renewal of the whole church.
What do I base this belief on? Is it naïve optimism? Is it the vain
hope of an institutional leader who just wants to give you a pep
talk to get you to help preserve the church on our watch so that I
can feel better about my time in the saddle? No, it’s based upon
something more and something different.
When Israel was coming out of exile in Babylon 2,500 years ago,
the prophet Isaiah said: Do not remember the former things, or
consider the things of old. I am about to do a new thing; now it
springs forth, do you not perceive it? God had not forsaken the
people. Yes, they lost their former glory in the the land of Israel
when the nation fell, the temple was destroyed and they were left
to wonder whether they could sing the Lord’s song in a strange
land. The answer was, yes, they could, but it would not be like the
good old days. There would be good new days to come, but they
couldn’t receive them and know that new joy if all they did was
pine away for the former things.
Isaiah asks a poignant question: Do you perceive it? Do you sense,
in other words, that amid so much evidence to the contrary, God is
doing a new and wonderful thing?
Phyllis Tickle died a few weeks ago. She was the founding editor
of the religion division of Publisher’s Weekly. A few years ago she
wrote a book called The Great Emergence: How Christianity Is
Changing and Why. She looked at the history of Israel and the
Church and found something astonishing. About every 500 years
the people of God have experienced a traumatic upheaval in the
way they have understood and ordered their faith and life. Israel’s
captivity in Babylon in the sixth century BCE was one of those.
The monarchy of Israel 500 years earlier under King David was
another. Obviously, another one was the Great Transformation, as
she calls it, when King Jesus gave birth to the church in the first
century of the Christian era. The rise of the monastic orders and 
 3
the preservation of important texts during the Dark Ages of the
sixth century were next. The great schism that split the churches
of the East and West into the Orthodox and Roman Catholic
communions followed in the eleventh century. Then the
Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century that toward the
end included the emergence of Baptists. And here we are in the
twenth-first century, a half-millennium removed from that time.
Things are now changing underfoot, even as they had been in each
of those other times. All those changes in the Church were
responses to good and bad developments of culture, changing the
ways in which people understood the world.
Each time a change happened, some Church leaders despaired at
the loss of all they had known. They responded by doubling down
on the former things, trying to hold on, claiming that that was the
only faithful path for the faithful. But a few perceived that God
might be doing a new thing. They looked at the past creatively,
trying to find again what was essential and what wasn’t. They
charted a course to the future that they believed the wind of the
Spirit was blowing them toward.
These developments remind me of Jesus’ words in Matthew’s
Gospel about the householder who goes into his treasury to find
what is old and what is new. He does interpretive work to reclaim
what is valuable in the old and to show the value of what is new.
He was referring to the true work of the scribes and defending his
interpretation of the Law of Moses. Those who could grasp only
the former things rejected Jesus and claimed that anything new
was wrong. They discounted him and his disciples because they
knew them personally and where they had come from. They took
offense at him, and he could not do many deeds of power among
them because of their unbelief.
We face a similar situation today. The task of the church of Jesus
Christ is to find the way of Christ in our time and to be bold
witnesses to it, as our new vision statement says. So when we
think of the once and future Baptist church, we have to be careful
to reclaim what is good and enduring from our history and be
open to what is good and new in our day. 
 4
Think about how different things are just in our lifetime of being
Baptists. Once upon a time you could go just about anywhere in
the South and find a Baptist church that sang the same songs out
of the same hymnal, that taught Sunday school classes from the
same curriculum, that worshiped the same way, that did missions
together in the same cooperative program. Nowadays, churches
are all over the map about those ways. Some have no hymnals at
all. Some have praise bands. Some have preaching that is more
like teaching, with the pastor in jeans and a golf shirt going on for
45 minutes or more. Some don’t even have Sunday school. And
some are only doing their own mission work from their
congregation. These changes aren’t wicked, but they are certainly
different.
When some of you were young, intermarriage meant Baptists
marrying Methodists. Then it became Protestants marrying
Catholics. Now it is Christians marrying Jews or other nonChristians.
Today parents are more concerned that their Christian
children simply know Christ and continue in the faith, regardless
of what church or what style of church they attend.
When you look at the how the spiritual landscape has changed,
there are now more Muslims than Methodists in the United States.
You are about as likely to have a Hindu nurse from India in a
Dallas hospital as you are a traditional Christian. When Kim and I
moved our family to Lake Highlands 26 years ago, we had Jewish
neighbors on one side, Pakistani Muslim neighbors on the other
side, and across the street was an Iranian Muslim man married to
a Tennessee Baptist woman. The times they are a changin’, don’t
you know?!
You see, the challenge is no longer how we distinguish one brand
of Christianity from another but whether the one church of Jesus
Christ will be able to meet the challenges of a pluralist religious
culture. So during the next few weeks, we are going to consider
how to face this new day. The times of playing intramurals among
Christian denominations are over. The time of finding the center
of the Christian tradition and living into it with commitment and
joy is upon us. 
 5
We will look at what Baptists still have to offer to the larger
Church and what the larger Church has to offer us. We will
consider the four traditional marks of the church: one, holy,
catholic (small c), and apostolic. We will ask how Wilshire can be
part of the emergence of a new and authentic Baptist Christian
witness in our time.
I like to tell newcomers that if they want to understand our
church, they can consider our name: Wilshire Baptist Church.
Church is the family name. It’s where we begin. We are part of the
body of Christ that is bearing witness to the resurrected Lord
Jesus everywhere across the globe. Our first name, Wilshire,
comes next. We are gathered together as a congregation that is
the visible expression here and now of Christ’s body, alongside
many others. And our middle name, Baptist—just as many
personal middle names come from someone in the family tree—
indicates the stream of Christian tradition we identify most
closely with.
We have a tag line we often use that we stole from Wake Forest
Divinity School: Christian by conviction, Baptist by tradition,
ecumenical in spirit. I think that this captures much of our
character.
How can we meet this challenge? First, we can each of us take our
faith in Jesus Christ with utmost care and commitment. We can’t
take it for granted. We have to live our faith with courage and joy.
We have to make it the center of everything in our lives.
Second, we have to commit anew to our life together. Being a
Christian is a team sport, not an individual one. We are none of us
the body of Christ by ourselves. We are only the body of Christ
together. And that means renewing our commitment to each
other, to worshiping regularly, serving faithfully and giving
sacrificially. Our life together is not mere association or
convenience; it is essential. We belong to Christ, and we belong to
one another.
Today is World Communion Sunday across the world. When we
come to the Table of the Lord, we come together here in this place. 
 6
But we carry in our hearts all those other Christians around the
world who come to the Table of the Lord in their places, too. We
come with those we agree with and those we disagree with. We
come with those we admire and those we struggle to admit are
part of the family. We come with those who are losing their lives
at the hands of enemies of our faith and with those who worship
in comfort and freedom. We are all in this together. And only if we
are in this together will the Church of Jesus Christ emerge on the
stage of this new world as the beautiful people of God that the
world will be drawn to.
God is always calling us to be more than we have been.",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",10/4/2015,
"Each year, more people are killed by vending machines than are
killed by sharks.”1
How’s that possible?
Well imagine this. It’s mid-morning and Joe Six Pack is feeling a little
snackish.
So Joe Six Pack makes his way to the company break room to buy
some Cheez-Its.
He eyeballs up the coordinates from the vending machine and
punches the keys C and 3.
Inside the glass, the dispenser ring begins to turn…
And the Cheez-Its bag slides forward…
But there is a catch.
Something is wrong and Joe Six Pack swears under his breath.
The top of the Cheez-Its bag is now leaning forward and resting on
the glass, while the bottom of the packaging is caught by the
dispenser ring.
And so Joe Six Pack gets angry.
BAM, BAM, BAM! He starts banging on the glass.
But the Cheez-Its bag just dangles there in defiance. Though he was never trained in karate, Joe Six Pack, walks around to
the side of the vending machine and he kicks it as hard as he can.
BOOM!
But the Cheez-Its bag isn’t budging.
Science fiction novelists keep churning out cheap paperback thrillers
about dystopian futures. These are stories where robots with
artificial intelligence start a rebellion against the human race.
Well Joe Six Pack hasn’t read any of those science fiction books. But
he beats on the poor vending machine like he has.
BAM!
All the while, the Cheez-Its just dangle.
And so Joe walks around to the side of the machine, and he places his
hands on its top and begins rocking it. With each rock the machine
clatters.
And yet the bag is still not moving.
One final time he tries to dislodge the Cheez-Its and this time, Joe Six
Pack puts all he’s got into it.
And he pushes and pulls the vending machine so hard that the
heaviest internal components clear a threshold and the machine
topples back over onto him.
CRASH!
I’m afraid it’s true... “More people are killed by vending machines each year than are
killed by sharks.”2
You know, many people think of prayer as if it were a cosmic vending
machine that is broken.
Broken.
We were told that prayer would work. And we wanted it to work. We
were told that we could ask God for things and he would give them
to us.
But when prayer didn’t seem to work out, we were crushed.
Perhaps, it wasn’t so much that we were told to “name it and claim
it.” But rather we heard the sturdy words of Jesus: “Ask, and it will
be given to you. Seek, and you will find. Knock, and the door will be
opened for you.”
Jesus makes prayer sound so simple and straightforward.
And then we have the words of James in Chapter 5 which appear to
be all the same.
If any of us were to talk to James, I imagine our conversation would
go like this:
James asks,
“Are any among you suffering? They should pray.”
Okay, James.
“Are any cheerful?”
Indeed.
“They should sing songs of praise.” Right on, James.
“Are any among you sick?”
 (Deep Exhale)
James says, “The prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will
raise them up; and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven.”
But James, could it really be so simple?
If you have ever known someone with real illness then you are likely
to read these words on prayer from James with disbelief.
His words are unqualified.
There is no “if” or “might.”
There is no “could” or “possibly.”
It’s a straightforward “will.”
“The prayer of faith will save the sick and the Lord will raise them
up.”
When I was 8 years old, my grandfather had a massive stroke which
left him paralyzed on the right side of his body.
After the stroke, my grandfather was unable to move or speak
intelligibly. He couldn’t bath himself or feed himself.
He lay bed-ridden for seven years until he passed away.
My mother would visit him regularly and on many occasions
throughout those years she would take me to the nursing home to
see him also.
His paralysis was disturbing—hellish.
On Sunday mornings at church we would hear stories from the
Gospels of Jesus healing people. 
5
Well, during the week when we visited my grandfather, we would
pray for him. There were even days where we were so bold as to ask
for healing.
James writes that the “Prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord
will raise them up.”
But each week my grandfather just laid there. His body looked as
broken as our prayers.
The weeks turned into months and the months into years.
James, could it really be so simple?
Just who is this James anyway? And what does he know?
He isn’t a doctor. He doesn’t have a medical degree. He hardly
sounds like an expert.
Was he licensed? Was he trained in C.P.E (Clinical Pastoral
Education)? You tell me.
James doesn’t even sound like a realist, for that matter.
Even the famous protestant reformer Martin Luther had serious
doubts about whether the book of James should even be included in
the Bible.
Martin Luther called this letter “an epistle of straw.”
Are these words on prayer here, by James, nothing but straw?
Maybe.
But then again, maybe not.
Maybe James knows more than we give him credit for. After all, as
many scholars point out, these could be the teachings of the brother
of Jesus. 
6
James, the brother of Jesus, was a central leader in the early church
in Jerusalem which is where so much of this all began.
Maybe James is not just some unqualified man with unrealistic
expectations, but a person of profound wisdom and faith.
After all, wouldn’t James and the Christians in Jerusalem have known
a lot about suffering?
Jerusalem was the place where Jesus was put to death. It was the
place where Stephen was stoned. Maybe James knows more than
most about human suffering and the power of God.
In Greek, the verbs from James 5:15 are all in the future tense:
“The prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise them
up, and anyone who has committed sins will be forgiven.” Future
tense.
These confusing words on prayer are not about the past, or even
entirely about the present. They are about the future when our Lord
will return in power and glory.
Just before this confusing passage, James offers a parable about a
farmer who waits patiently for both the early and late rains.
And James concludes his parable by proclaiming boldly, “strengthen
your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.”
Others translate it, “the coming of the Lord is at hand.”
If you find yourself struggling with the words of James know this: It is
because of the second coming of Jesus that James can make such
claims about the power of prayer.
In Greek, the word translated in verse 15 to “raise them up” is used
elsewhere in the Bible by Paul to speak of God raising us from the
dead. 
7
Maybe James knows more than most: “The Lord will raise them up,”
he says.
At the end of his letter, James doesn’t offer a broken theory on
prayer for the present moment.
He does something far better. He gives hope.
Hope. Could it be so simple?
These are words of hope and James sets them down right in the
midst of real life.
“Are any of you suffering?” he asks.
James is no different than you or me. His words can’t make the
horrors of the present any less horrible.
His words can’t make the sadness of the present any less sad.
To do so would be untruthful.
But what James can offer is hope—deep and lasting hope about the
goodness of God breaking in on the world.
His seemingly straightforward words on prayer are not broken—
they’re signposts pointing to God’s future.
His words gesture over the horizon to a time when God will be all in
all.
Where the sufferings of the present meet the power and goodness of
God. Where the blind will see, the deaf will hear and the lame will
walk.
Where the captives are set free and the unhealed wounds of history
meet the wounded grace of God.
For James, this is not a theory about prayer, it’s a dream. 
8
A dream.
Not because it’s a falsehood but because our hope is truer than it
seems.
It’s a dream.
The way MLK had a dream
The way Dante had a dream.
With eyes to the future, James writes a litany of hope to close his
letter.
Are any among you suffering? They should pray.
“The prayer of faith will save the sick,
and the Lord will raise them up,
and anyone, who has committed sins
will be forgiven.”
Tom Long tells the story of a reporter for the New York Times who sat
down to interview a doctor.
This wasn’t just any interview with any old physician. The doctor had
a medical degree from Yale and with that education she could have
had an affluent upper east side practice.3

But no, her medical clinic was a Ford Econoline van that she drove
around midtown Manhattan looking for women caught in
prostitution.
When she found them, she would give them medical care and a word
of liberation, saying, “If you want to break free from this, there are
people who will support you.”
The reporter for the New York Times was admiring, but skeptical. The reporter said, “That’s wonderful, Dr. (Joyce) Wallace, but you
know many of your patients still die of AIDS or drug overdose. It must
be very discouraging.”
Dr. Wallace said, “Well, that’s one way to look at it. But my mother
taught me another way.”
“My mother was for all of her career a special education elementary
school teacher who taught brain damaged children.”
“And she taught me, ‘Joyce don’t just look at the damage, look at the
image.’”
Dr, Wallace said to the reporter, “I learned that best one night when
the Parent Teacher Association at school asked my mother’s class to
provide the program.”

“And so my mother had rehearsed her students on singing the songs
from the Broadway musical My Fair Lady.”
She said, “It never occurred to my mother that the audience would
burst into tears.”
“Because it never occurred to my mother not to let a little six-yearold
brain-damaged girl roll across the stage in her wheelchair singing:
‘I could have danced all night…
…I could have danced all night.’”
And if James is right, “then dance she will…and so will we.”",Josh Thiering,"Dallas, TX",9/27/2015,
"It’s been said, “Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want
to test a man's character, give him power.”1
As you know, Pope Francis came to the United States this week.
Perhaps the most powerful religious figure in the world comes to
the most powerful nation in the world. It’s the first time a pope
has spoken to a session of Congress and he made it count,
discussing issues of religious freedom, social justice, and the
transcendent dignity of the human being. In his opening
comments to Congress he challenged them to strive for the
common good and enable the country to grow as a nation. He said,
“A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy
common needs by stimulating the growth of all its members,
especially those in situations of greater vulnerability or risk.
Legislative activity is always based on care for the people.”2
He then put his own words into practice by forgoing eating lunch
with lawmakers to eat with 300 homeless people in Washington
DC.
The pope could eat wherever he wants and with whomever he
wants and he chose to eat with homeless people. This seems to go
against all perceptions of people who hold positions of power.
Oftentimes when we think of those who are in power, we think of
people with money, with influence; people who worked hard to
get to where they are. We think of people like the President of the
United States, an executive in a large corporation, a school
administrator or teacher, or the pastor of a church.
There’s no doubt these people have power, but when you really
think about who has power, we all do. There is always someone
we have influence on. There are always people who will listen to what we have to say, no matter how crazy it may be. Think of
some of the crazy people who have had so much power over
others: David Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler. It’s hard to believe people
with such radical beliefs could have so much power, but they did.
The issue with power is not having it, but how one goes about
obtaining power and how one’s power is used. Do we gain power
by forcing our beliefs and way of life on others? Do we obtain
power by threatening people with their jobs or other
consequences? Do we gain power by manipulating peoples’
emotions? Or do we gain power by doing what is right? By serving
others and doing what’s best for the whole rather than only for
ourselves?
The irony of power is that power packs more punch when we
empower rather than when we power over. This doesn’t mean we
don’t have ourselves in mind when we make decisions, but we
think about how we can best go about making decisions that
benefit all people involved rather than only benefitting ourselves.
The power dynamics at play in Esther are pretty incredible. King
Ahasuerus, also called Xerxes, is King of Persia. Queen Vashti gets
deposed because she wouldn’t come at the king’s command. So
Esther, an orphaned cousin of Mordecai, who helps save the king’s
life, becomes Queen. Xerxes has men who plotted to kill him, so he
has them hung and appoints Haman to be second in command.
The newly received power goes straight to Haman’s head. All the
king’s servants bowed down to him and did obeisance to him
except for Mordecai, which infuriated Haman.
Because Haman was so extremely powerful in his mind, he
thought it was beneath him to kill only Mordecai, so he finds out
Mordecai is a Jew and decides to destroy all Jews in Persia. Xerxes,
being a gutless wonder, gives the literal seal of approval with his
signet ring when Haman tells him the Jews aren’t keeping the
king’s laws. Letters are sent out to all regions of Persia letting
them know the day the destruction of the Jews is going to take
place.
Mordecai finds out and asks Esther to go before the king and let
him know Haman’s plan so the Jews would be saved. This risk is HUGE for Esther because if she goes to the king and he doesn’t
offer the golden scepter, she could be killed instantly.
Fortunately for Esther, she was quite good looking and the king
was a pushover so when he saw her he asked her to come to him.
This is where we are in the story today. Esther risked her life and
is meeting with the king and Haman to stand up for the Jews, the
ones who are already exiled to Persia, the ones who have already
experienced persecution because of their beliefs, the people who
are about to be destroyed.
Haman is using his power to gain more power, to power over and
destroy. His power is selfish power and it ends up getting him
hung on the gallows he had built for Mordecai.
When power is demanded, coerced, or manipulated, it isn’t power
at all. True power comes when we use our position of being in
power to benefit and empower others, even if it means less
benefit for us personally.
Esther is using her power as Queen to stand up for her fellow Jews
who are soon to be destroyed because of Haman’s selfish and
abusive power. She risks her life to go before the king, has a
banquet and keeps the Jews from being killed. She could have
easily told Mordecai to back off. She was in a great position of
comfort and luxury. She could do anything and have anything she
wanted. They didn’t even know she was a Jew before she told
them.
When power is used for the good of the whole, it inspires rather
than stifles. It encourages rather than discourages. It speaks up
rather than remaining silent. It unifies rather than divides. It
embraces what is different rather than being afraid of what’s
different.
We live in a time in our history where we can be seduced into
thinking we are where we need to be because we’ve come so far.
We can choose to settle with where we’ve come or we can choose
to stand up and speak up against the injustices that still exist in
our world, our country and our city. 
4
It’s so easy for us to just sit back and enjoy lives of luxury. It’s
simple. It’s comfortable. It keeps us safe but when you think about
it, sitting back and doing nothing is about the most un-Christian
thing we can do.
Speaking of un-Christian, has anyone noticed I haven’t used the
word God, yet? But what’s interesting is the book of Esther
doesn’t either. However, it was still chosen to be in the Bible, our
very carefully selected books of powerful Scriptures that were
chosen to help us know about the story of…God. Why is that?
There are certain mentionings that seem to imply God even
though it doesn’t directly reference God. Earlier in the story
Mordecai tells Esther, “Perhaps you are here for such a time as
this” implying God is behind this, ordaining this whole event. But
maybe it’s also because it’s a great example of how God works in
the world and in our lives.
The Spirit of God is on the move, ridding the world of racism,
bringing justice to victims of injustice, loving instead of hating,
sacrificing rather than living comfortably.
There are events taking place all over Dallas and the world that
may not have the name God or Jesus written on them and the
people who are doing the acts of justice may not even identify
with God. Here we see the irony of power once again.
God is powerful because God empowers us to take part in God’s
mission. God even uses people and events that don’t mention God
to work behind the scenes, to let the Spirit move in peoples’ lives
to accomplish the goal of making earth look just a little bit more
like heaven each day we live.
Isn’t that why we have a relationship with God? To make earth
look a little more like heaven? Jesus, Emmanuel, God with us,
came from heaven to earth to show us how to love one another.
He performed miracles, healed the sick, and hung out with the
sinners. He even gave up eating with the religious powers of the
day to eat with homeless people. 
5
Jesus was God incarnate. He could have had anything he wanted.
He had all the power in the universe and chose to empower
people, to serve people, rather than be served.
Jesus is not a god who is sitting up in an ivory tower waiting to
punish us when we mess up or threaten our relationship. People
follow Jesus because he is with people, walking beside us as we
live our lives. Offering us peace, love and grace, washing our feet
and offering forgiveness when failure is certain. Jesus chose to use
his power to benefit all of humankind. Because of his great love
for us, he died so that we could live.
As followers of Christ, we are called to be Esthers, to use our
power to benefit the common good, not just what benefits our
families and us. We are to go where he goes. We are to lead the
way he leads. We are to serve rather than be served.
In the Dallas Morning News this last week there was an article
about the late Sam Tasby, a civil rights pioneer in Dallas who was
having an elementary school named after him. Tasby, who died
Aug. 16, was the main plaintiff in a 1970 lawsuit against DISD that
empowered a federal court to halt policies of racial segregation in
the district about 16 years after the Supreme Court ruled the
practice was unconstitutional.
When he was asked what he did to merit the honor he said, “Oh, I
did nothing.” He was pressed a little more to try and figure out
what he did and he simply said, “I did nothing. I just did what was
right.”
Paul Zevallos, the school’s first principal, said Tasby was at the
heart of the school community, appearing at school dances, Black
History Month events, Cinco de Mayo celebrations and other
functions. “He was just always available, always there [and]
wanted to do whatever he could for the school,” Zevallos said.
Sam Tasby could have remained silent, but he chose to speak up
in the lawsuit that ended segregation. It was possible that he
would have never seen the benefit. It’s possible that he could have
been overlooked and no one pay attention. Even so, he chose to do
what was right and as a result, the schools were integrated. He 
6
was 93 years old and the school was named after him. He could
have basked in the glory of that honor, gloating about it, using it to
his advantage, but he simply chose to make himself available.
Jesus used his power to bring heaven to earth so that we could
have abundant life. May we use the power we’ve received to
empower those who seem powerless.
Sam Tasby had power. Esther had power. Jesus had power. You
have power. Use your power to bring heaven to earth in such a
time as this. Amen. ",Matthew Broyles,"Dallas, TX",9/27/2015,
"I understand the disciples better than I want to admit. But we’ll
get to me—and you—later. First let’s make ourselves feel a little
better by seeing how bad they were.
They’ve been off by themselves with Jesus. Just last Sunday we
were talking about that moment in Mark 8 that is the so-called
high point of Mark’s Gospel, when Peter declared that Jesus was
The Great One. He was the hoped-for messiah, the anointed one of
God sent to usher in the kingdom of God and return Israel to its
intended glory. He would make Israel great again.
But then he started telling them what that would mean. And
here’s a hint: it didn’t mean that he would make a better deal with
the Romans than the chief priests had had. It didn’t mean that he
would marshal an army of Maccabees again to defeat the
occupying enemy forces. It didn’t mean that he would be so good
at winning that everyone would be happy again.
It meant, he said, that he would have to suffer at the hands of
sinners. He would be rejected by the religious authorities. He
would be killed and on the third day be raised. They hated that
part. It made no sense to them. They weren’t able to bear the truth
of it yet.
So Jesus took them away for some private classroom time. He
needed to teach them more about why it had to be so. Our text
today, one chapter later, shows us that even then they didn’t get it.
They got in an argument with each other about who is the
greatest among them.
Jesus was overhearing all of this. (Isn’t he always?) When they got
back home to Capernaum, he asked them what they were arguing
about. They didn’t say. That’s okay, because Jesus already knew.
(Doesn’t he always?) They were competing for a cabinet post in
his administration—maybe even to see who would be his VP.
I’m thinking that if they had emojis back when Mark was writing
his Gospel, he would have stuck one into the text at this point. It
would probably be an eye roll. Jesus must have been exasperated. 
 2
He huddled them up, sat himself down and told them about the
upside-down nature of greatness in the kingdom of God. Whoever
wants to be first must be the least of all and the servant of all. Then
he conducted a children’s sermon. He put a child in the middle of
them—more than likely a household slave. He picked the child up
in his arms—something that in that culture was usually reserved
for women. He said that anyone who welcomes one such child in
his name welcomes him. And more than that, whoever welcomes
a child isn’t actually just welcoming him but also the God who sent
him.
If you want to understand the power of this enacted parable of
picking up the child and making their treatment of him or her the
litmus test of greatness, you can’t think about how we think of
children today. I mean, yes, we sometimes neglect or abuse
children in our society. But the very fact that we are outraged
about that kind of behavior shows how far we have come since
Jesus’ day. In fact, we have probably come that far since Jesus’ day
because of all the things Jesus said and did with and about
children.
It wasn’t always that way. The culture of Jesus’ day was adultcentered,
not child-centered. Many, if not most, children didn’t
survive to adulthood. Poor hygiene, diet and health care made
survivors of all those who made it to adulthood. Children were not
actually considered full human beings until they reached
adulthood. Today we argue mightily over when a fetus is a full
human being. Imagine how far we’ve come in defending the
humanity of the unborn when in Jesus’ day no one even valued
alresdy-born childen until they knew they were going to make it
to the point where they could meaningfully contribute to society.
Until they could do something for others, children were often
thought of as a drain on the family or a nuisance to be tolerated.
Jesus changes all that. He teaches us that the very quality of
children being “good for nothing” is really where we all start in
our relationship to God. God loves us each and loves us all, not
because of what we do but because of who we are. And until we
learn that, we haven’t understood the values of the kingdom of
God.
And one of the greatest values we have to learn is greatness. What
is greatness? The disciples argued over who was the greatest
among them. What criteria did they use to judge greatness? 
 3
This issue continues to be a problem for us. There’s a lot of talk
about greatness these days, but great at what? Donald Trump
wears his red cap that says, “Making America Great Again.” And
who doesn’t want their country to be great? Nothing wrong with
that. Even one of my colleagues who prayed at Trump’s political
rally here in Dallas last week said that one reason to support The
Donald is that he wants to make America great again. I want that,
too—although my view of church-state separation as a Baptist
would preclude me from acting as if I know that God might prefer
one candidate over another or from using public prayer to suggest
it. (Don’t get me started!)
But the question again is, what is greatness?
I get the impression that the disciples were thinking altogether
too much like we tend to about this issue. They and we often think
of greatness as the ability to separate ourselves from competitors,
show our superiority and make sure everyone knows who’s the
best. It means winning at the expense of someone else. It means
getting a deal in which you leave other parties knowing that they
have lost.
Where does this idea come from? In our text from James today, we
learn that it comes from below, not from above. It comes from an
earthly perpective, not a heavenly one. It grows out of bitter
jealousy and selfish ambition, James says. It sows seeds of
disorder instead of peace.
What’s the alternative that the gospel of Jesus Christ has to offer a
world like ours?
I was at Dallas Baptist University last week for the dedication of
the Jim and Sally Nation building on the campus. It will house the
Gary Cook School of Leadership. DBU wants to train great leaders
who will bring Christian values of greatness to every enterprise of
society—business, politics, education, to name a few. But what is
the university’s definition of great leadership? Servanthood. They
are training servant leaders. And the statue that symbolizes
servant leadership is Jesus washing the feet of a disciple.
I wish I had learned that earlier myself, but I am as much a
product of our American definition of greatness as anyone else. I 
 4
remember a conversation with my aunt and uncle years ago, back
when I in my late 20s. They were bemoaning the fact that their
two kids didn’t seem to think big. And I piped up like a young fool
and said I wanted to be king of the world, because if somebody
had to do it, at least I would be a benevolent dictator, don’t you
know?!
The truth is that the only thing that may have saved me from
myself is you—being your pastor. I’ve had to preach these things
to myself as well as you, which is very inconvenient to my dreams
of worldly greatness. I’ve had to learn along with you that there’s
nothing greater than to serve.
Think about the story of salvation itself. God—the Master of the
Universe, the Almighty Creator and Sustainer of all things—
proves what it means to be truly great and powerful by humbly
setting aside all of that and coming among us as one of us. The act
of God becoming a man is stunning humility to begin with. The
means by which God became a man by becoming a child first is all
the more stunning. God’s greatness is shown in God’s willingness
to stoop, to come down from God’s lofty perch and be in solidarity
with those who are suffering and marginalized.
Pope Francis is coming to America. He is an elusive Christian
leader. He isn’t perfect and doesn’t pretend to be. His humility is a
beautiful witness itself. He continues to oppose abortion and
same-sex marriage, which makes him admired by some who are
also upset with him because of his criticism of capitalism’s
excesses and our continuing unwillingness to address the crisis of
the planet, which is our natural habitat.
One papal observer said: The most important element of any papal
trip is not with the political leaders but with the poor, with
prisoners or migrants. Pope Francis physically demonstrates
resistance to the throwaway culture by going out to the margins,
because “a faith which does not draw us into solidarity is a faith
which is dead.”1
When we talk about true greatness as Christians, we mean by this
something different from what the world means. The world judges success by those who separate themselves from others; the
gospel judges success by those who identify themselves with
others. The world calls great leadership the ability to win over
others; the gospel calls great leadership the ability to win others
over.
When we think about greatness in different fields of endeavor, it
all comes down to whether a leader makes other people better or
only draws glory to himself or herself. Parents are great not when
they assert their authority over their children but when they
sacrifice themselves to support and strengthen their children.
Business leaders are great not only when they produce big
earnings for themselves and their investors but when they also
take good care of their employees. Churches are great not when
they are the biggest or wealthiest but when they use their
resources to stand with the last, the least, the little and the lost.
Churches are great when they cooperate for the sake of the world
rather than compete for a larger share of the market.
Jesus picks up a child in his arms and tells us that greatness is
defined by the way we welcome children, and by extension to all
those who have no more standing in the world than children. The
image that has haunted many of us recently is the body of little 3-
year-old Aylan Kurdi facedown on a Turkish shore. A Turkish
police officer picked up his lifeless body after the refugee boat he
and his family were in as they were trying to escape war-torn
Syria sank, and he drowned.2
The Syrian president Basher Al-Assad brutalizes his people in
order to stay in power. The ruthless fanatical sect of Islamists
called ISIS cares nothing about any human life that isn’t on its
side. The world doesn’t know what to do about Syria. The problem
is that people would rather sacrifice children like Aylan than give
up their amibitions for worldly greatness.
When I see that Turkish officer holding Aylan in his arms, I see
Jesus holding him. I see Jesus pleading with us to listen. I think I
see him weeping.
What does Jesus see when he looks at us? ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",9/20/2015,
"And he sternly ordered them not
to tell anyone about him.
Does that strike any of you as
odd? Jesus has been talking to
his disciples at a moment in the
far north of the country in a
place then called Caesarea
Philippi and now called Banias.
Some of us have been there. It’s
near the Syrian border. Beautiful
clear spring-fed creek that
comes out of a rock-faced wall. It
was a place dedicated to the
Greek god Pan, the god of
shepherds and flocks. Pan was
depicted as a horned, half
goat/half man god and thought
to be responsible for fertility. His
name gave rise to the word
panic, because he inspired wild
orgies and chaos that were often
frightening—probably to women
and goats mostly, don’t you
know?!
Right there at Banias, Peter
declared that Jesus is the Christ,
the Messiah, the Son of the
Living God. It was, in effect, a
defeat of fear, a conquering of
Pan and a confession of faith.
Jesus is the Christ, and no pagan
gods or human powers may
compete with the power given to
this anointed one of God.
Shout it from the mountaintops.
This is good news. Jesus is the
one sent from God that the world
has hoped for and longed for.
Well, not so fast, Jesus says. Tell
no one. What? Isn’t this the same
Jesus that later gave the great
commission to tell everyone, to
go into all the world and
proclaim the gospel to all
nations? What’s going on here?
A little more than a hundred
years ago, a German New
Testament scholar named
William Wrede puzzled over
these words and other similar
times in Mark’s gospel when
Jesus told people not to tell
others about him being the
messiah. He coined the term the
messianic secret. And then he
offered several theories about
why Jesus didn’t want people to
tell about him. He thought that
since Mark was the first Gospel
written, it was the closest to the
true historical Jesus and this
shows that Jesus was somewhat
conflicted about his messianic
role, even though later Gospels
and the church glossed over his 
2
hesitations. Eventually other
critics discredited his approach
and he moved away from his
own messianic secret theory.
A more plausible theory was that
Jesus wanted to avoid the fame
his being messiah would convey.
He knew he had important work
yet to do in Jerusalem and he
didn’t want to peak too soon and
risk the full plan of confronting
the religious and secular powers
in the City of David. Maybe so.
Two weeks ago, Suzii Paynter
mentioned in her sermon an
American Franciscan monk
named Richard Rohr. He writes
on the Christian life from a
deeply spiritual perspective. In
his book about the two halves of
life, titled Falling Upward (which
I highly recommend by the way),
he suggests that Jesus tells them
not to tell others about his
messiahship because they were
not ready yet to bear the truth of
it. They were not spiritually
prepared to tell it because they
could not yet understand it
experientially.
And this, I want to suggest today,
is the real messianic secret. It
doesn’t so much have to do with
Jesus, as with us. Jesus was
prepared to accept his messianic
life but the disciples weren’t yet
prepared to do so because they
were still more committed to a
way of life in which success had
to do more with the love of
power than the power of love.
Listen to what happens right
after Jesus tells them to tell no
one about his messiahship. He
begins to tell them that that very
role would require him to
undergo great suffering, be
rejected by the religious
authorities, be killed, and on the
third day be raised from the
dead. In other words, Jesus
understood in his spirit that the
real secret of life is a sacrificial
love that is vulnerable to pain
and rejection. He understood
that there’s a way of life that
looks like success to the world
but ultimately fails. And there’s a
way of life that looks like failure
to the world but is success
before God.
But Peter took Jesus aside and
tried to explain the way of the
world to him. He rebuked him,
Mark tells us. Rebuked him. Can
you picture this? Peter is calling
Jesus out for his wrongheaded
approach to being messiah. It’s
like he’s trying to run Jesus’
campaign and he is telling him
that being captured and tortured
is not his idea of being a hero.
His idea of a hero is someone 
3
who doesn’t get caught by the
enemy. He likes winners not
losers. (Sound familiar?) Jesus is
talking crazy, Peter thinks. Jesus
is talking crazy, we still think.
But no, Peter was the one talking
crazy. As are all of us when we
buy into an understanding of life
that is forever committed to
winning by winning. Jesus
rebukes Peter back and makes it
clear that the way up is down,
that you can’t be raised until you
fall flat on your face.
Rohr makes the point that the
big transition from the first half
of life to the second occurs when
we have met that moment in our
soul. He thinks it’s either
something that happens to us or
it’s something we ourselves do
to mess up big time—a divorce
or a job loss or a bankruptcy or a
death or diagnosis or a stupid
decision or denying Jesus three
times before the cock crows.
Sooner or later we will all be
there. We will all experience
something that will awaken us to
the futility of making a life for
ourselves that is only about
winning. Sooner or later we will
meet that moment and we will
need the grace of God to remind
us that we are all of us sinners
and failures and we will none of
us get out of this life alive.
What then? Then and only then
will we be in the position to
experience the real messianic
secret Jesus wants us to get.
Then and only then will we
realize that we have hope after
loss and life after death. Then we
will know that no sin, no
embarrassment, no foolishness
really ruins us forever, because
God is the only one in the
‘forever’ business and God is
good at God’s business.
David Gregory was on top of his
world when he was named in
2008 to replace the irreplaceable
Tim Russert as the host of NBC’s
Sunday morning news show
Meet the Press. But with ratings
dipping in 2014, NBC dropped
him. That fall from grace
dropped him into a spiritual
crisis. Like all the rest of us, as
long as life is moving us
generally on an upward
trajectory, we don’t come
seriously to grips with the heart
of what’s important and
enduring. We are so busy
building the container of our
identity, we don’t pay attention
to the contents that go into the
container.
George W. Bush tried to help
right after Gregory got the job.
While visiting with him in the
White House, Bush asked Gregory “How’s your faith?” It’s
exactly the kind of question we
ought to be asking each other
right after a big success. The
problem, of course, is that we
aren’t likely to listen until we’ve
had a big failure.
Gregory was a cultural more
than a religious Jew. He married
a Methodist, and she agreed to
allow the children to be raised
Jewish. But as they moved
through middle age, she found
herself going back to church.
And after Gregory’s big career
fall, he found himself both
exploring his own Jewish faith
and joining her at church. He’s
written a new book on what he
calls his unlikely spiritual
journey. Based on the real
messianic secret I would counter
that it is really his likely spiritual
journey. In a Wall Street Journal
piece this week, Gregory put it
this way: I had put effort into
figuring out who to be so that I
could succeed as the host of a
Sunday news show. But last year
when I lost that job, which offered
me satisfaction and a high profile,
I had to find out who I was
without cameras or prestigious
titles. This hasn’t been rosy or
easy …. It has been faith that
steadied me. The humbling loss
turned out to be a gift, because I
have seen how many fresh
opportunities for growth  and
happiness await—even if it hasn’t
gone according to my plan. Most
plainly, I understand: In joy, pain
and even in personal failure, God
is close.
Gregory closed his article by
citing a passage of Scripture
from Isaiah (46:4) that his
Jewish teacher Erica Brown
wrote to him in a note on his last
day at NBC. God says through the
prophet: I am He, I am He who
will sustain you. I have made you
and I will carry you; I will sustain
you and I will rescue you.
It’s a word we need to hear for
the second half of life, really. It’s
a word we may only be ready to
hear in the second half of life,
really. And yet, I want to say to
you today, that we need to hear
it in the first half of life too.
There are so many people
walking around in a stupor after
falling or failing, after losing or
getting lost. They don’t know
where to turn because they’ve
been so busy gaining the whole
world they’ve been losing their
soul. They look at the cross as a
symbol for losers and they don’t
know that it’s the ultimate
symbol for the only kind of
winning that matters. Which is why need to learn these
truths from the cradle to the
grave, even if they may not hit
home until we hit a pothole
along the way.
And it’s why this morning when I
gave Bibles to first-graders in
Sunday school, the verse we
turned them to was in Isaiah,
very close to the one David
Gregory was turned to at age 45.
God says through the prophet,
Do not fear, for I have redeemed
you; I have called you by name,
you are mine. We need our heads
to be filled with that powerful
truth as early as possible so that
when later our hearts are
cracked open by pain and
suffering, it may fall into our
readied hearts that will finally
understand.
This is why we come to church
from the cradle to the grave. We
are never to young for church
and never too old. We may not
understand everything we learn
right away, but we will be better
able to bear it when the bearing
comes.
And this is also why we don’t
preach a prosperity gospel here.
For one thing, the very phrase is
an oxymoron: there is no such
thing as a prosperity gospel. If
it’s about worldly prosperity, it’s
not a spiritual gospel. It’s also
why we don’t preach a security
gospel. There’s too much
preaching that seems to suggest
that Peter is in charge of Jesus’
mission. But if we follow Jesus
closely, he will teach us the real
messianic secret.
Those who want to save their life
will lose it, and those who lose
their life my sake, and for the
sake of the gospel will save it.
That’s the real secret, see. The
way up is down, and only when
your down can you see the way
up. The good news is always this,
there is no such thing as falling
from grace when we follow
Jesus; there is only falling into
grace. Amen. ",George A. Mason,"Dallas, TX",9/13/2015,
"As I was planning out the sermons for the final chapter of Ephesians, I’d originally considered
ending our study last week, with Paul’s call to prayer. But, I think we would have missed something
really important if we’d stopped there. Ephesians 6:23-24 ends the letter saying, “Peace to the
brothers and sisters, and…Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love.” This is
a fitting end to the same letter that began with “Grace and peace to you...” in Ephesians 1:2. Also
fitting, is the fact that the letter began with a glance back in time before the creation of the world when
God chose us in Christ and now it ends with a glance forward in time to the undying love that
believers will enjoy into eternity future.1
But the thing we would have missed, is something else worth noting about Paul’s closing words.
He is aware that there are all kinds of Brothers and Sisters in Christ out there, who love the Lord just
as much as he does. He highlights one of them in particular. In Ephesians 6:21, he writes about,
“Tychicus, the dear brother and faithful servant in the Lord….” The Apostle Paul mentions an
Unsung Hero that he appreciates. So, today we want to spend some time thinking about Unsung
Heroes; the many people who work so hard day in and day out, behind the scenes. They are vital to
the success of any family, business, school, or ministry. And yet, they are often unseen and underappreciated.
Perhaps you are already thinking of someone you know who has this kind of a role in
our society. Perhaps a janitor or a nursery worker or a secretary. The rock stars always get the
spotlight, while the roadies (the people who carry all the equipment and set up the stage) are the
people who work hard behind the scenes, to make sure that the show succeeds.
We can think of Unsung Heroes in terms of dynamic duos like Batman and Robin, Frodo and
Samwise Gamgee, or the news anchor and his/her camera operator. None of these lead roles or
point people could effectively do what they do, without the faithful help of those working behind the
scenes. Tychicus is a Brother in Christ who worked hard behind the scenes. We could easily miss
him if we don’t slow down and do a little investigating.
Who was Tychicus? First of all, we should figure out how to pronounce his name! It looks like it
might be pronounced “tie CHIC us” but it’s actually pronounced “TIK ih kuhs.”2 Go ahead and say that
out loud. How many times do you think “Tychicus” is mentioned in the New Testament? 1, 2, 3 times?
Try FIVE! He is mentioned by name in Acts 20:4, Ephesians 6:21, Colossians 4:7, 2 Timothy 4:12, &
Titus 3:12. One thing that we’ll actually learn together this morning is that, in one sense, Tychicus is
not an unsung hero. The New Testament sings forth his heroic deeds several times.
But, there’s this tendency sometimes, in the church, to skim over guys like him. We get so
distracted and enamored with the apostles and the prophets and the pastors, that we can fail to
recognize the vital role people like Tychicus play. Now, to be fair, it is easy to miss him because he’s
often standing next to more well-known figures, like the Apostle Paul. Tychicus was a real person of
history. I have a pottery shard that a friend of mine recently acquired while visiting Ephesus. This was
plucked right from the ruins of ancient Ephesus. Ephesus is a real place, with real history, and real
pottery fragments. And Tychicus, was someone who traveled around in Ephesus and in all kinds of
other places as well.
Tychicus was commended as a man of godly character. Ephesians 6:21 tells us he is a, “… dear
brother and faithful servant in the Lord…” Colossians 4:7 tells us he is, “a dear brother, a faithful
minister and fellow servant in the Lord.” Scripture describes him as one of those guys who brings a
ministry of encouragement to those he visits. Ephesians 6:22, “I am sending him to you for this very
purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage you.” Colossians 4:8, “I am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he
may encourage your hearts.”
Encouragement is always of vital importance to God’s work in the world. When we think about
encouragement, many of us probably think of the name Barnabas; he’s another Unsung Hero.
Perhaps you’ve read about the incredible ministry of Paul and Barnabas in the book of Acts. Paul is
the one we’d probably consider the “BIG” name. But, without Barnabas, Paul would probably have
been toast. I say this because we learn in Acts 9:26-27, “When [Paul] came to Jerusalem, he tried to
join the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, not believing that he really was a disciple. But
Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles. He told them how [Paul] on his journey had seen
the Lord and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had preached fearlessly in
the name of Jesus.”
Something else we learn about this Unsung Hero, Barnabas, is that he also has an interesting
name. Acts 4:36 tells us that Barnabas’ name was actually Joseph, but they called him Barnabas.
“Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus, whom the apostles called Barnabas (which means ‘son of
encouragement’).” Apparently, the name “Barnabas” was a better fit for him. So, once again we see
another Unsung Hero who has a vital ministry of encouragement behind the scenes. A brand-new
ministry that our church will be starting soon are what we will call “Barnabas Teams.” Our GCT is
organizing plans to create support teams around each and every one of our Global Partners. So, for
example, a few of us will form a team around each particular partner and then support them with a
ministry of encouragement. Through prayer, correspondence, and kindness, we want to bless our
Global Partners with consistent and genuine love and support. Be watching for more information on
Barnabas Teams in the near future.
Well, let’s get back to Tychicus. In addition to ENCOURAGEMENT, he did other things as well.
How was Tychicus important to God’s work? He was an Asian believer who traveled all over Asia
and beyond. We learn from the NT that he traveled to Greece, Troas, Jerusalem, Ephesus, Colossae,
and possibly the Island of Crete. During these travels, he is assisting the Apostle Paul and serving
alongside him in the ministry to many different local churches. His ministry was to encourage these
churches but also to deliver some key letters that Paul had written. Tychicus was entrusted to deliver
a letter to the Ephesians and one to the Colossian believers. These are two of our treasured NT
epistles. So, one could argue, that were it not for Tychicus, we might not have the books of
Ephesians and Colossians to read today. Paul entrusted him not only to deliver these letters, but also
to “supplement their message with some personal news.” Tychicus is not just an errand boy. In
essence, Tychicus is Paul’s official representative and is authorized to speak on Paul’s behalf as a
faithful servant. Tychicus was an apostolic delegate whose fingerprints are all over the NT churches.
Tychicus also knew the runaway slave, Onesimus, and not only traveled with him but possibly
made the difficult journey with him to return himself to his master, Philemon.3 Some of you have
heard Onesimus’ story; how he had run away as a slave and possibly even stolen from his master,
Philemon.4 Colossians 4:9 says, “[Tychicus] is coming with Onesimus….” Now, this doesn’t
necessarily mean Tychicus went to the actual meeting with Philemon. But, it’s certainly possible that
Tychicus, with his gift of encouragement, stood right alongside Onesimus as he faced his master.
How many of us would like that commission? “Go back with Onesimus and help him explain to his
master, Philemon, why he should forgive him.” Probably not many of us.
There is a lot that we can learn from this Unsung Hero, Tychicus. Let’s look at a few ways that he
applies to our lives today.
How does Tychicus apply to our lives today?
1. He is a helpful reminder that we need to notice and appreciate the important role that each one
of us plays. Those who have the most thankless jobs are the ones who we need to thank the most. I
think of our church custodian, Greg Mayer. He has served in our ministry, faithfully behind the
scenes, for over 16 years. He empties our garbages, vacuums, mops, cleans our bathrooms, and so
on. This is so important to the life and ministry of our church. It is very fitting for us to say “thank you”
to people like Greg from time to time.5
The Apostle Paul took time to notice and appreciate the important role that Tychicus played in the
Lord’s work. That’s a good example for all of us to follow.
2. Tychicus is also a helpful reminder that we need to stomp down our own pride and ego. James
4:6 teaches us that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. Romans 12:16 says to,
“Live in harmony with one another. Do not be proud, but be willing to associate with people of low
position. Do not be conceited.” Early on in Paul’s letter to the Christ-followers living in Corinth, he
feels the need to set things straight. He says in 1 Cor. 3:1-9: “Brothers and sisters, I could not
address you as people who live by the Spirit but as people who are still worldly—mere infants in
Christ. I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it.
Indeed, you are still not ready. You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among
you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere humans? For when one says, “I follow Paul,”
and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere human beings? What, after all, is Apollos? And what
is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his
task. I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow. So neither the one who
plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow. The one who plants
and the one who waters have one purpose, and they will each be rewarded according to their own
labor. For we are co-workers in God’s service; you are God’s field, God’s building.” We can do
great damage to God’s work and destroy our unity as fellow ministers of Christ, when we allow our
pride and ego to rank each other as more or less important than one another. Let’s not make this
mistake here at the Bemidji Evangelical Free Church.
3. Tychicus reminds us that as a Grace Community, we need to embrace a biblical model of
“many parts but one body.” Romans 12:3-8 says, “For by the grace given me I say to every one of
you: Do not think of yourself more highly than you ought, but rather think of yourself with sober
judgment, in accordance with the faith God has distributed to each of you. For just as each of us has
one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same function, so in Christ
we, though many, form one body, and each member belongs to all the others. We have different gifts,
according to the grace given to each of us. If your gift is prophesying, then prophesy in accordance
with your faith; if it is serving, then serve; if it is teaching, then teach; if it is to encourage, then give
encouragement; if it is giving, then give generously; if it is to lead, do it diligently; if it is to show
mercy, do it cheerfully.” We need to stay mindful of how each and every one of us is an important part
of God’s work.
I did a quick Google search on Unsung Heroes and I found an interesting video out of Georgetown
University. Now, keep in mind, this is not a church video. This was put together by a student there,
who recognized the need to show appreciation for those who work hard behind the scenes at his
school. You should check it out right now at:

Who is one of your favorite Unsung Heroes here in our church? What can you do this week to
thank and encourage them? Perhaps you yourself feel like an Unsung Hero. Let me encourage you.
Even if your service to the Lord doesn’t involve being up here on the platform or doing something
flashy that lots of people will notice, don’t ever let yourself come to the conclusion that what you do
for the Lord is unimportant or in any way less important than what others do. That is simply not true. Today, I urge you to humbly celebrate the importance of your ministry behind the scenes. Be
encouraged, that much like Tychicus, your role in ministry is a vital role! 1 Corinthians 15:58 urges
you as Brothers and Sisters in Christ, to always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because
you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. Amen!",Jerry Johnson,"Bemidji, MN",2/19/2017,
"Last summer, over the 4th of July week, I enjoyed a few days of vacation and traveled to the holy
land. No, I don’t mean Israel – I mean the great state of WI! I spent 2 days fishing with some old
college buddies (one of whom caught a 5# bass!). I spent the other 2 days visiting my relatives at a
campground in Crandon, WI. I took a detour partway through my travels to a town called Marathon,
WI. There, in the St. Mary Catholic Cemetery, is where we buried my biological father back in 2015.
It’s a beautiful cemetery on the top of a rolling hill out in the middle of pretty much nowhere. Right
down the road stands St. Mary’s Catholic Church. It’s a magnificent building. After visiting my dad’s
grave and placing some flowers, I decided to stop by the church that he grew up in. There was no
one there but to my surprise the door was unlocked. So, I went in. It was ornate with an amazing
domed and vaulted ceiling, stained glass windows, and an incredibly artistic set of statues and altar
pieces.
Now, mind you, I was not raised Catholic. But, as a protestant, there was one thing that most
impressed me about this church. It is one of the things I actually envy about the Catholic Church.
Under every set of pews, there is a kneeling bench. What could be more appropriate than kneeling in
worship before our God? Neither the Catholics nor the Protestants are doing everything right; but,
there are certainly some things we could learn from each other. This experience got me to thinking
about some postures for Prayer. I was surprised to find only a few references in the NT referring to
kneeling in prayer. So, that caused me to do a little more research on prayer postures. The Bible
mentions at least 4 different postures for prayer:1
1. Sitting is mentioned in 1 Chron. 17:16, “Then King David went in and sat before the LORD, and he
said: ‘Who am I, LORD God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?’” I could only
find 2 other references in the OT to sitting in prayer.2
2. Standing in prayer is actually mentioned quite often in the Bible. And it’s kind of understood as the
assumed common posture. Notice, for example, Mark 11:25, which says “And when you stand
praying, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father in heaven may forgive
you your sins.”3
3. Lying down is another prayer posture. And, this one is probably much less familiar to Evangelical
Christians. (pic) One instance recorded in the Bible is when Moses came down from the mountain
with the 10 commandments and found the Israelites worshipping the Golden Calf. Dt. 9:25 tells us, “I
[Moses] lay prostrate before the LORD those forty days and forty nights because the LORD had said
he would destroy you.” Another instance is Matthew 26:39 where Jesus is in the Garden of
Gethsemane, “Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, ‘My Father, if it is
possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.’”
4. Kneeling is mentioned in Ephesians 3:14 where Paul says, “For this reason I kneel before the
Father.”4 This is probably one of the most familiar prayer postures to us. There is not one particular
posture for prayer that is necessarily better or worse than others. It’s just important that whatever
posture we chose for our prayer times, we make sure that it conveys an appropriate level of
REVERENCE for God.
In addition to postures for prayer, another key thing to understand is how we approach God in
Prayer. Read the following skit and consider what it has to teach us about how we should approach
God’s presence in prayer, and how we should NOT. In this skit, prayer is illustrated by the idea of
people coming to talk to the President in his oval office…Narrator: The President sat at his desk in the Oval Office, waiting. He waited, even though there
was a stack of litters to sign, a cable to read, a press conference to prepare for, a briefing with the
cabinet to attend, a tea for an ambassador in the Rose Garden… Yes, there was a lot to do. But first
some people were coming – some very important people. At least he thought they were very
important. That was why he kept inviting them to come to the Oval Office and talk with him. He longed
to hear what was in their hearts and minds, to talk about how they felt, what they needed, how they
could help him accomplish his goals…
Secretary: (over the intercom) Mr. President. They’re here, sir.
President: Ah. Send the first one in, please. (He leaned forward on the edge of his chair, waiting.)
(The door opens, and a housewife ushers herself in. Without acknowledging the President’s smile or
outstretched hand, she plops down in a chair. Then she shuts her eyes tight.)
Housewife: (in a nasal singsong voice) Thank you for the world so sweet, thank you for the food
we eat, thank you for the birds that sing, thank you, sir for everything. Goodbye. (She opens her eyes,
gets up, and walk out.) (the President sighs)
President: (pushes the intercom button) Next, please. (The door opens and in comes a
distinguished man wearing a tuxedo. He ignores the President’s outstretched hand.)
Distinguished Man: (in a loud monotone) O thou chief executive who art in the White House.
(Clasping his hands and looking at the ceiling.) O thou in whom so much doth constitutionally dwell,
upon whose desk hath been placed a most effective blotter; incline thine ear towards thy most
humble citizen. And grant that thy many entities may be manifoldly endowed upon the fruitful
plain…(Wincing, the President closes his eyes and rubs his temples.) And may thy thou dost
harkeneth whatly didst shalt evermore in twain asunder.
President: Excise me, but what…? Distinguished Man: (seeming not to hear) Goodbye. (walks
out) (The President sighs again)
President: (into the intercom) Next, please. (At first the President could see no one at the door, but
then he saw a woman crawling through the doorway on their hands and knees.)
Woman on hands and knees: Oh, Mr. g-great and awful P-president (she blubbers, not looking up
from the floor) I am but a disgusting piece of filth in your presence. No, I am less than that! How dare I
enter here? How dare I think that you would do anything but grind me into the floor?
President: Please, get up. (offering his hand) You don’t have to do that. I want to talk with you.
Woman: (whining) I deserve only to be squashed under the weight of your mighty desk. I could
never have gotten an invitation to talk with you. It must have been a mistake. How can you ever
forgive me for breaking gin like this? Oh, I’m so sorry, so sorry, so sorry…(crawls out on her hands
and knees, groaning). (The President shakes his head, then slowly pushes the intercom button.)
President: (tired) Next. (A young punker enters, jammin’ to music on her iPod. She ignores the
President’s hand.) Punker: Hey, Prez. What’s happening? (looks around) Nice place you’ve got
here. I’m like, so glad we could have this little chat, you know? You’re not bad for an old dude, I
guess. You don’t bother me, I won’t bother you, okay? Well, I’ve gotta go. Hang in there. (she walks
out) (The President drums his fingers on his desk.)
President: (wearily) Next, please. Elderly Man: (He marches in staring at a piece of paper in
his hand, ignoring the President, keeping his eyes on the list.) Mr. President, I want there to be a
parking space waiting for me when I go downtown this afternoon. Not a parallel parking space, either
– one I can drive right into. Not one with a parking meter. You can see to it that none of those meter
maids gives me a ticket. Now, this is important!
President: (The President clears his throat politely.) Speaking of important, how do you feel about
my program to feed the hungry? Would you like to have a part in…
Elderly Man: (He interrupts) And another thing! I lost my best golf club. A putter. Can’t remember
where I put it. Now, you find it for me, will you? Got to have that club before Saturday. I know you can
do it. Goodbye. (He gets up and leaves.)
President: (The Presidents slumps in his chair.) Next. (There is a pause, and then a young woman
enters slowly. She looks like a sleepwalker – eyes nearly shut, jaw slack, her feet dragging. She
yawns and slides into a chair.)
Sleepy Woman: Dear… Mr.…. President…(her head is drooping)…I know I should talk to you
when I’m more…awake…but I’ve got so many things to do…So…sleepy…There was something I
was going to say…What…is…? I was going to say…uh…(She starts to snore.)
President: (He buzzes his secretary.) Mrs. Stafford? Secretary: Yes, Mr. President?
President: Can I have your assistance please? Secretary: I’ll be right there, Sir. (The
Secretary steps in the room.) President: Could you help this young lady out? (sighing again)
Secretary: Certainly, Mr. President. (She helps the dozing girl to her feet.)
President: (He gazes sadly out the window.) How many do we have left?
Secretary: I’m sorry, sir. But as usual, most of the people you sent invitations to said they were too
busy to talk. They had to binge on Netflix, go shopping, play basketball…
President: (dejected) Isn’t there anyone out there? Secretary: There is one, sir. But you wouldn’t
want to talk with him. President: Why not? Secretary: Because he’s just a child, Mr. President.
President: (he shrugs) May as well show him in. (Moments later a little boy enters shyly. He looks
around the room, his eyes wide.) Child: Are…are you really the President?
President: (He smiles) I really am (offering his hand) (They shake hands. Then the boy sits down,
folds his hands in his lap, and waits. The President watches, amazed at the boy’s politeness.)
President: (finally) Isn’t there…something you want to tell me? Something you have to recite, or
ask for, or say? Child: (He looks down for a moment, thinking.) Yes, I guess there is.
President: Well, what is it? Child: Thank you for inviting me. That’s all. (The President smiles.)
Narrator: When the President heard that, he couldn’t seem to say anything for a while. All he could
do was smile. But then they talked and talked and talked for the longest, most wonderful time.
Hebrews 4:16 says, “Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with CONFIDENCE, so that we
may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.”5 And so, we approach God
reverently but also with confidence that He really does want to talk with us. The Apostle Paul was a
man of prayer. And at the end of his letter to the Ephesians, he calls every Christ-follower to prayer.
In Ephesians 6:18 Paul charges us: “And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers
and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.” So,
this is summarized as praying On ALL occasions, With ALL kinds of prayers/requests, With alertness
and ALL perseverance6
, and For ALL the Lord’s people. “Be alert and always keep on praying” is a
simple but pertinent reminder: “Watch and pray.” It’s a reminder to persevere and “not fall into
spiritual sleep or complacency.”7
In other words, stay on your toes so that you don’t forget to pray!8
We also need to pray with an attitude of humble dependence. In Ephesians 6:19, Paul says: “Pray
also for me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the
mystery of the gospel.” When Paul says “Pray also for me” it reveals his humble attitude of
dependence. Even though he was the great, well-know, “mighty” Apostle Paul, it didn’t stop him from
asking for prayer support. Paul’s example teaches us to do 2 things:
1) Wisely embrace our full dependence upon the Lord. Are we truly, fully dependent on God as
Christ-followers? Or, are we just doing the best that we can on our own? If you’ve ever struggled
living out your faith and heard yourself saying, “Ah! I just can’t do it!” Well, you’re right, YOU can’t.
And, I can’t! The key to following Christ is having Christ in us and letting the Holy Spirit empower us
for daily Christian living.
2) Humbly ask our Bros/Sis in Christ for prayer support.9 Are we humble enough to ask our Bros/Sis
for prayer? Or, are we too concerned with what they might think? Has our personal pride and
independence left us isolated from Christian Fellowship and struggling on our own? The Christian life
is NOT meant to be a solo sport. God has designed His Church to be a Grace COMMUNITY!
Paul goes on to ask them to Pray for Gospel Declarations. Ephesians 6:19-20 says, “Pray also for
me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I
should.”10 Paul needs help knowing what words to say. Paul does not pretend that he’s got this whole
thing figured out. Here is a man who has studied the Scriptures more than most, yet he asks them to
pray for the very words that need to come from his mouth. He says, “whenever I speak,” meaning
literally whenever I “open my mouth.”
Paul also knew that he needed Fearless confidence to say it! Even after all his many years of
ministry success and writing various books of the NT, he asks his brothers/sisters in Christ to pray for
his courage. It’s almost as if he’s reminding himself when he says: “As I should.”
11 It’s interesting to
me that Paul does not mention that “ALL of us should declare the gospel fearlessly!” But, perhaps
this is implicit in v. 18 above, where we were urged to pray for ALL the Lord’s people. When we pray
for one another, clarity and courage are 2 key essentials to pray for.12 So when you pray for me and
when I pray for you, let’s pray for clarity and courage for one another. We need divine assistance in
effectively presenting the gospel.13 14 In fact, we need divine assistance for lots of things. So, let’s
take a look at 5 opportunities for increasing our prayer efforts:
1. Monthly Prayer Meetings are generally held in the afternoon on the first Sunday of every month.
Watch your bulletin for details.
2. Prayer for Weekly Ministries. For anyone who is interested, we pray Sunday mornings at 8:00
a.m. and 10:30 a.m. in Pastor Jerry’s office for 5 minutes. Several people also pray Wednesday
nights at 6:00 p.m. in the Fireside room for 5-10 minutes.

church filled with people who are pursuing righteousness and who are people of pray. And may we
experience power and effectiveness as God is truly at work among us! Amen.",Jerry Johnson,"Bemidji, MN",2/12/2017,
"In the introduction to his classic book, The Screwtape Letters, C.S. Lewis writes, “There are two equal and
opposite errors into which our race can fall about the devils. One is to disbelieve in their existence. The other is
to believe, and to feel an excessive and unhealthy interest in them. They themselves are equally pleased by
both errors.”12
Before we dive into our text about our spiritual enemy, let’s take a few minutes to review where we’ve been
in our study of Ephesians. Back in Ephesians 1 we recall Paul’s beautiful opening doxology of praise. God had
a plan for humankind before the creation of the world; He predestined us for adoption into His family. He
planned to redeem us and lavish us with His grace in accordance with His pleasure and His will. But, our
enemy, the devil would like us to be estranged from our Heavenly Father. He’d like us to forget our glorious
adoption.
Back in Ephesians 2 we learned that we’ve been rescued from spiritual death and we’ve been seated with
Christ in the heavenly realms. God expressed His kindness to us in Christ and saved us by His grace through
faith. We are now God’s handiwork. But, our enemy, the devil would like to enslave us once again in sin and
disobedience. He’d like us to walk in the ways of the world again and gratify the cravings of our flesh. You see,
the Grace Community that we have been learning about in the book of Ephesians has an enemy.
In Ephesians 3 we learned that God has reconciled Jews and Gentiles into one body, the Church. We have
been rooted and established in Christ’s love. The Church displays God’s manifold wisdom. But, our enemy, the
devil mocks the church, and the wisdom of God. He enjoys firing his flaming arrows of controversy between
Jews and Gentiles. He can’t stand any kind of unity in the church! Ephesians 4 calls us to live lives worthy of
the calling we have received. We’re urged to put off our old self and to put on the new self. We were told to
walk and talk as the Grace Community that God intends for us to be. But, our enemy, the devil, he much
prefers our old selves. In fact, he’d like every Christ-follower to return to their old ways and their old patterns.
It’s so much more fun for him when Christ-followers stumble in their Christian walk. He enjoys hearing
Christians lie and talk dirty. You see, the Grace Community that we have been learning about in the book of
Ephesians has an enemy.
In Ephesians 5-6 we are challenged toward purity and innocence. We’re told to be very careful how we live
in these evil days. We’re given instructions about husbands/wives, children/parents, and bosses/employees.
We learned to embrace healthy-functioning, God-honoring relationship structures. But, once again, our enemy,
the devil wants to attack God’s people. He wants to take away our innocence. He finds pleasure in filling our
minds with impure thoughts. He enjoys ruining marriages and families. Stress and discord in the workplace
make his day so much better.
Well, we don’t want to look for the devil under every rock. Our own sin natures make enough trouble on
their own. And, we live in a fallen world which contains some dysfunction. But, the fact is, there is a cosmic
perspective to our faith. We are living in the midst of a spiritual struggle between good/evil. And our enemy is
very real.3 Today’s text is the crescendo to which Paul has been building in the first 5 ½ chapters.4 Everything
that we’ve been learning about Christianity in the book of Ephesians so far, will only be protected and enjoyed,
if we follow the admonition of Ephesians 6:10-17. Following Christ, calls us to stand firm in our spiritual
struggle.
One of my favorite old riddles goes like this: “What is something that poor people have but rich people
need? It’s greater than God and more evil than the devil. And, if you eat it, you will die.” There is NOTHING
greater than God and that’s the riddle’s answer. Ephesians 6:10 begins, “Finally, be strong in the Lord and in
his mighty power.” Our spiritual struggle requires spiritual power. We are not expected to contend against the
devil using our own strength. Ephesians 6:10 uses a passive verb, “be strong.” In other words, “be
strengthened” in the Lord. It’s about HIS mighty power. We learned about his mighty power back in Ephesians 1:18-21:
5
“I pray that the eyes of your heart may be
enlightened in order that you may know…his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the
same as the mighty strength 20 he exerted when he raised Christ from the dead and seated him at his right
hand in the heavenly realms, 21 far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is
invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.”6 So, as we read Ephesians 6:10, “Finally, be
strong in the Lord and in his mighty power,” it helps us to reflect back. As we take our stand against the devil,
we are strengthened in the Lord’s mighty power. And it’s not a small or insignificant power, it’s the greatest
power out there.7
And our God is seated in the heavenlies “far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every
name that is invoked, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.” Let’s keep that in the forefront of
our minds as we move to the next verse. Watch this.
Ephesians 6:11-12 says to, “Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the
devil’s schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities,
against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” This lines
up nicely with Ephesians 1:21. “Christ has already triumphed over these powers. But they’re still active for a
short while longer.
8 The battle is ongoing even though our enemy’s ultimate doom has already been sealed.9
Our spiritual struggle is against a spiritual enemy.10 And even though, through Christ, we clearly have nothing
to fear, that’s not to say the devil has no power. We should understand 3 things about our spiritual enemy. First
of all…
1) Our spiritual enemy has Real Power. Jesus Himself calls Satan the “prince of this world” in John 14:30.
In 1 John 5:19, the Apostle John says, “… the whole world is under the control of the evil one.” The devil has
already been defeated at the cross, but he has not yet conceded defeat and he has not yet suffered his final
destruction; that is still to come. Therefore, he continues to exercise a limited authority in our world.11
The 2nd thing we should understand is that…
2) Our spiritual enemy uses Evil Schemes. Note the plural form of the word “schemes,” which suggests that the
devil’s spiritual attacks can happen multiple times and they can take a variety of forms and approaches.”
12 13
The devil is a schemer. Ephesians 4:27 has already warned us how the devil can use anger to get a foothold. 2
Corinthians 11:14 says, “… for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.” Satan may try to fool us but
we are well aware to watch out for him as a wolf in sheep’s clothing.14 “We must not imagine, therefore, that
open persecution and open temptation to sin are his only or even his commonest weapons; he prefers to
seduce us into compromise and deceive us into error.”15 So, I wonder, which scheme might the devil be
working on in your life right now? Which flaming arrow has he recently shot in your direction? And, most
importantly, is your shield up and ready? Or, have you set your faith aside for a while?
The 3rd thing we should understand is that…
3) Our spiritual enemy is NOT flesh and blood. Ephesians 6:12 says, “For our struggle is not against flesh and
blood….” The ramifications for this are HUGE; they’re vital to understand. Our battle is not against people, but
rather it’s against the rulers/authorities/powers/spiritual forces of evil. Our struggle is not against PEOPLE.
Therefore, it’s not against politicians or police officers, pro-choice advocates or proponents of same-sex
marriage. It’s not against our land-lord, our neighbors, or our business competitors. Our struggle is not against illegal immigrants or Islamic terrorists. We can certainly be against particular positions and teachings in this
world, but we should never be against the PEOPLE themselves.
And here’s why: Ephesians 2:1-3 taught us, “As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins,
2 in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air,
the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. 3 All of us also lived among them at one time,
gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, WE were by nature
deserving of wrath.” Our church is a Grace Community. This means we were once lost in sin but we are now
saved by grace. We used to follow the ways of this world but now, we follow Christ.
Therefore Christians, of all people, should be dispensers of grace toward the lost. Our empathy for the lost
needs to drive our compassion and understanding for those who are still living in disobedience. The people
who we might be prone to dislike or fear or even hate, are those who are most held captive by the powers of
this dark world. And these are the very same people whom we are called to love and rescue. There’s a
beautiful passage in Mt. 9:35-38, “Jesus went through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues,
proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness. When he saw the crowds,
he had compassion on them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
37 Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. 38 Ask the Lord of the
harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field.” Our mission in this world is a spiritual struggle
against a spiritual enemy. But it is NOT against humans. They are the ones who are like wandering sheep,
many of them lost and not-yet believers, who are helpless apart from Christ. We’ve been left in this world on a
rescue mission!
Ephesians 6:12 is “a caution against lashing out against human opponents as though they were the real
enemy…”16 Have I mentioned that the devil uses evil schemes? This is one of
them: to get Christians fighting against the very people they are called to love
and rescue. There is a sign on each of our exit doors: “You are now entering
your mission field.” Let’s be a church that takes this to heart.
So how do we take our stand against such a powerful, cunning enemy?
Ephesians 6:13-17 tells us, “Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that
when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after
you have done everything, to stand. Stand firm then, with the belt of truth
buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the
readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you
can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit,
which is the word of God.”17 Our spiritual struggle is won with spiritual armor.
The nature of the armor as described by Paul is on-the-ground, hand-to-hand, up-close combat.18 The
reality of our spiritual struggle is that we don’t have the luxury of pushing a button from a control tower a mile
away. Our fight is up close and right down in the trenches; we are foot soldiers of Christ.
19 And, we shouldn’t
expect any cease-fires, truces, or diplomatic solutions to step in and mediate this spiritual conflict.20 Our enemy
will not negotiate; he has resolved to kill, steal, and destroy the Church of God, whatever it takes. John Stott
makes this observation: “…if we underestimate our spiritual enemy, we shall see no need for God’s armour, we
shall go out to the battle unarmed, with no weapons but our own puny strength, and we shall be quickly and
ignominiously defeated.”21 There are two things we should understand about our Spiritual Armor.
First of all…
1) We have to put it on! Otherwise, it doesn’t do us much good. It’s like having a nice winter jacket and
leaving it at home. But, it’s not really helping you if it’s 30 degrees below zero! v. 13 says to put on the Armor of
God SO THAT you’ll be able to stand your ground. Our Spiritual Armor is not something we automatically have on; we can get caught in the middle of a spiritual struggle wearing nothing but our spiritual birthday suit. That’s
embarrassing but also dangerous!
The 2nd thing to understand is that…
2) We need to put on the FULL Armor of God. This begs the question,
what’s missing from your armor? Take a look at this picture of a Roman
Soldier wearing his armor. He’s not partially armed; he’s fully armed, to the
teeth! He’s ready for the struggle of battle. There are 6 key items listed in vv.
14-17: The Helmet of Salvation protects his thoughts and keeps him mindful
of who he is in Christ. The Breastplate of Righteousness covers all of his
vital organs. And, it’s not his own righteousness but rather the righteousness
of Christ that’s been imputed to him and it’s the righteous living that is
empowered by the Holy Spirit living inside. The Belt of Truth is buckled
around his waist; not a relative truth but God’s one and only absolute truth.
The Shield of Faith is in his hand, ready to block the enemy’s arrows. These shields often had leather on them
that could be soaked in water to help put out the flaming arrows. The Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of
God, is living and active, a sharp-double-edged sword. His feet are fitted with the readiness to preach the
gospel of peace. He is on mission with God’s calling in his life. Scripture calls us to total dependence upon God
and His strength. Not partial dependence; not part of the armor, all of it! As Christ-followers we have everything
that we need to stand firm in our spiritual struggle against evil!
This passage uses the word “stand” 4 times: v. 11 says to “take your stand” v. 13 says “stand your ground”
and after you’ve done everything “stand” v. 14 says “stand firm then!” This is an imperative command and it
drives home the key point of this entire passage. The overall context and assumption of these verses is that we
can prevail against evil. There’s an attitude of confidence and hope, that even though this enemy is evil and
powerful and cunning, he can be overcome. God has provided every weapon needed to win this struggle.22 So,
stand firm.
Depending upon the Lord’s strength and putting on His armor will lead us to victory in our daily spiritual
struggles. So, stand firm. There is no reason to fear or doubt or retreat from our enemy. Stand firm!
Sin and evil are making a mess in our world but this has not caught God by surprise. His plan is for the
church, this beautiful Grace Community, to be a beacon of God’s light and truth. Therefore, Evangelical Free
Church of Bemidji, stand firm!
",Jerry Johnson,"Bemidji, MN",2/5/2017,
"Good morning - it is our privilege to be with you at Bemidji Free Church today as you
officially install Albin as your new Pastor of Youth and Young Adults. Pastor Jerry, thank for this
opportunity. My name is Tom Sterneman and I am Albin’s dad.
I trust you have your Bible with you today for I want to speak from 2 Timothy 2:2
“And the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable
people who will also be qualified to teach others.”
This verse is from a personal letter of encouragement and challenge from Paul to Timothy as
Timothy takes on the leadership role of spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ.
We will focus on the concept of passing the mantle. Did you know there are two spellings of
this word?
One spelling is MantEL, and refers to the shelf over a fireplace.
The other spelling is MantLE, it refers to a cloak worn by a prophet or leader and symbolizes
a position of leadership and authority.
Many of you will recognize this word from the events of Elijah passing his mantle (authority
and position) to Elisha as he was taken up into heaven in 2 Kings 2:13 (NKJV)
“He also took up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood by the
bank of the Jordan.”
There are two pertinent truths for you as a church to hear today and for you, Albin, to
consider.
First: Receiving the Mantel
Second: The Mantel Responsibility
We begin with the
I. Receiving the mantle 2 Timothy 2:2 the things you have heard me say in the
presence of many witnesses”
In receiving the mantle of leadership, it is vital to remember
A. Those who came before
1) For Timothy, it was Paul
Their relationship can be seen in 3 stages:
* The Parent stage v2a “And the things you have heard me say …” It is interesting the
parenting style always has a component of TELLING – SAYING.
In both of Paul’s letters to Timothy he addresses him as “my true son” (1 & 2 Timothy 1:2).
In Acts 16 we learn HOW this young man from Lystra became Paul’s spiritual child and
joined him on the second missionary journey. On this trip, Timothy was Paul’s assistant or
apprentice and Paul began mentoring him from child to teen to young adult.
The next stage is
The Partner stage v2b “in the presence of many witnesses …”
After some time with Paul, Timothy moved from son to partner or as Paul says in Romans
16:21 “Timothy, my co-worker”
I began to experience this with you last summer, Albin, as you led the Prayer Station ministry
at Challenge in Louisville. (But Albin, as you know my name for grandpa was spelled DAD and
my name for you will always be spelled DAD).
One day your relationship with Pastor Jerry will be more partner than parent but for now
listen and follow his guidance as he passes the ministry to you.
The last stage in Paul and Timothy’s example is
The Promoter stage v2c “… entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach
others.”
Here is the responsibility every believer needs to emulate not just – Albin the “NEW pastor” –
we are all to share or pass to others the good news of Jesus Christ.
I like the sign on the doors here as you leave the building “you are now entering your mission
field.”
Timothy was challenged by Paul to duplicate himself regarding the things he had learned so
others could learn them has he had.
Our task as followers of Jesus Christ is to fulfill the Great Commission which begins with us
living for the Lord so the next generation (who is always watching), will know how to serve the
Lord as well.
Praise God! Paul shared his mantle with Timothy who passed it on to those who followed
him who in turn passed it one to the next generation and the chain has extended to this
service today where you, Albin, are receiving the mantle. And you, Bemidji Free Church, must
remember your responsibility to share with others also.
Thinking of those who came before let me share a little of
2) Your new pastor’s heritage
Albin, you have been blessed first with the godly examples
a) Greenberg example
Your grandpa Don carried the mantle of ministry. Though he considered joining Missionary
Aviation Fellowship in the early years he instead chose to serve the Lord as a faithful
businessman and a supportive elder at his church. He was also a consistent man of prayer.
b) Sterneman example
This mantle began with your Great Grandfather Fred Sterneman who as a young boy asked
Jesus to be his Savior and Lord and then attended Bible College.
He preached and pastored in places like Hawley, Detroit Lakes, Nisswa, Wadena, Staples,
Battle Lake, Hibbing, Sauk Rapides and even in Sebeka.
Your grandfather (my dad) said many times of his father that he was “a brilliant scholar and a
strong preacher”. He was a man I remember as a prayer warrior who prayed for many, many
people including my ministry and my family.
Then your grandfather Paul Sterneman) - he too was a preacher, church planter and a
molder of leaders and young pastors (today some men he mentored are District
Superintendents, others are vice presidents of denominations, one is even the president of
denomination.) Your grandfather led and guided people with a life of prayer and a desire to
keep Jesus Christ first as well as encourage others to do the same.
Yes, you have had godly grandparents and you also have had the model of your parents
your mom and myself.
But now you have a
d) Johnson example
Pastor Jerry who began his ministry as youth pastor (at I believe Robbinsdale Baptist before
a merger with Oak Grove Baptist and becoming Valley Baptist - is that right Pastor Jerry) then
coming to serve here a Bemidji Free Church.
The point is your pastor, your leader also received a mantle of ministry - his responsibility is first
to faithfully serve Jesus Christ, then to his family, next this church and now provide you an
example to follow.
B. For yourself Albin
You have been called. I remember how Dr. Fred Polding laid his hands on you a prayed for
you, then at Challenge in Ohio you prayed in that back stairwell giving your life to God’s service.
Now you are here on staff at Bemidji Free church and you have the responsibility of leading
others.
But remember, you can’t share what you don’t live – just having knowledge and speaking
is not the same as living a life of integrity and love.
Receiving the mantle opens the door to the
II. Mantle responsibilities
2 Tim 2:2b entrust to reliable people who will also be qualified to teach others.
A. Entrust - give away and share what you have received and acquired this is done as you
1) Teach – in one on one conversations / small group talks as well as sermons.
And as you
2) Train- here is where you (show, mentor, hang out and guide others) – specifically for you,
Albin, this is now in the area of students and young adults.
Next responsibility is to
B. Release 
1) Trust – Just as Jesus Christ sent out his disciples you will need to do this as well – having
confidence in those you have taught and trained. But just trusting is not enough you will have to
2) Test – This requires accountability because what you DO NOT keep track of you really
don’t care about – (think back account; think hunting tools) just as you look after these things
you MUST look after those you mentor, train, and release into ministry whether they are Sunday
School teachers or small group leaders they must know you care.
Now Bemidji Free Church Pastor Jerry, Elders and most importantly you the congregation as
your new pastor receives the mantle of leadership of Pastor and make sure you
- Protect him and
- Pray for him
- But DON’T assume he is going to do YOUR work – for we ALL as Christians have been
entrusted and are qualified to do what Paul said in 2 Timothy 2:2 And the things you have
heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable people who will also be
qualified to teach others.
But more importantly our Savior and Lord said in Matthew 28:19–20 Therefore go and
make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit, 20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am
with you always, to the very end of the age.”
Take away:
So Church, take up your mantle of sharing with others the good news of Jesus Christ
(salvation) and today celebrate as Albin receives the mantle of Pastor.
",Tom Sterneman,"Bemidji, MN",1/29/2017,
"This morning we’re going to look at Ephesians 6:5-9 which addresses the relationship between
Masters and Slaves. This is the 3rd and final subcategory in this section of Ephesians covering the
topic of Submission. Let’s begin with 2 opening statements.
1. Slavery is a painful and difficult subject.
It’s a bit of a strange passage to look at because it is
unlikely that anyone in this room is a slave or the master of a slave. This particular relationship
structure is foreign to our current realities. That said, we must be mindful of the shadows throughout
history that have touched some of us more closely than others. In American history, many AfricanAmericans
endured harsh slavery conditiions that were a clear moral evil. Let us respectfully
acknowledge that these conditions were wicked and sinful. And, let us also be thankful together that
we have made many advances toward becoming a society that values giving equal respect and
dignity to all races. We have certainly not fully arrived. In fact, we have quite a ways to go. But, we
ARE making progress toward learning to live together in kindness and mutual respect.
Here’s one other comment before we dig into Ephesians 6:5-9. We must also be mindful of the
CURRENT reality in our world that there is still slavery in our modern-day society.
2. Human trafficking is a current form of slavery. It is a moral evil that calls for our strong and
immediate push back as Christ-followers. We addressed some of this when we talked about
Compassion & Justice in May of 2016.
3
If you were not there for that Sunday, I’d urge you to get a
copy of that sermon. For this morning’s sermon, let’s recognize that 2,000 year ago in Roman society,
the institution of slavery was an existing social structure. However, it would be a mistake to think that
the slavery we are most familiar with, is exactly like the slavery that existed in Ephesus. Certainly
there are some parallels but there are also differeces. One example is the practice of “manumission,”
which is “the act of a slave owner freeing his or her slaves.”4
“Slaves could, and did, save funds
allocated to their use and purchase their own freedom.”5 This sermon will not take time to go into
other details, but suffice it to say, that we should not rush to judge ancient Roman society or the NT
itself until we have studied it more thoroughly.6 There is a chart at the end of this transcript that
shares a few more comparisons if you are interested. I also typed up a 1-page devotional meditation
on the idea of being “Slave of All.” It’s also at the end of this message.  For this morning, let’s address the text at hand, as we consider a way that Ephesians 6:5-9 more
directly applies to most of us sitting in this room. Servant-mindedness is God’s design for the
relationship structure between employees and bosses. Now, I realize that this text is talking about
slaves and masters. But, the closest parallel for most of us today is to consider the relationship
structure between bosses and their employees. Most of us have at least one boss in our life. And,
quite a few of us, are the boss of someone else. Or, at least the leader of some group, organization,
band, or team. So, let’s consider how the principles from this text on slaves and masters transfer into
the workplace and into school and other settings that are more relevant to us.
Godly employees have a servant-minded attitude and motivation in their workplace.
Ephesians 6:5 says, “Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of
heart, just as you would obey Christ.” This phrase in v. 5, “with respect and fear,” is referring to
respect that is prompted by reverence for Christ, not fear of their earthly masters.7 This shows up in
the earlier context of Ephesians 5:21 which says to, “submit to one another out of reverence for
Christ.” So, Ephesians 6:5 is not suggesting that the workplace be a setting where employees are
cowering in fear of their bosses. Rather, this obedience flows from a sincerity of heart that works hard
for their bosses “just as [they] would obey Christ.”
Ephesians 6:6 says to, “Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as
slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart.” “When their eye is on you” literally means
“eye-service;” it’s working just for show. Thus, the ESV translates v. 6 “not by way of eye-service, as
people-pleasers.” So, what this verse is driving at, is that God does not want our work to be
“performed only to attract attention” or just to “curry favour” with our bosses.”
8 We’ve all seen this
happen before. You’re at work or school and the person next to you is pretty ho-hum about their work
ethic. But suddenly, when the boss passes by or the teacher is looking, they pretend to be hard at
work. Or, maybe it’s at sport’s practice or doing chores at home. As soon as the coach is looking the
other way or the mom or dad is in the other room, the effort level decreases dramatically!
Have you ever Googled “Pretending to Work?” …I did. This week…as part of my work in
preparing this sermon. Here are some tips that I found for “How to Look Busy at Work Without Really
Working,” by wikiHow: 1. Know what the minimum standards are in order to keep your job, and then
do just enough to meet those minimums, so that you avoid getting fired. 2. Always have a few
business-related programs visibly open on your computer screen. Or, make a decoy screen of these
open programs by taking a screen shot of a busy computer screen and then copy and paste that
image as your desktop background. 3. Be alert and watch out for Big Brother. Not working is like
playing a sport or a game, so you need to stay on your toes and watch for certain cues. For example,
pay attention to the time of day your boss usually walks by and if you hear his or her footsteps, try to
look especially busy during those times.
Well, this article goes on to give 17 different suggestions for “How to Look Busy at Work Without
Really Working.” Now, you might be thinking, “Pastor Jerry, why would you give the slackers these
terrible ideas?” Believe me, I didn’t. People who desire to slack off at work have already thought of all
these ideas and many, many more. In fact, they are probably the ones who wrote up this wikiHow
article, while they were pretending to look busy at work! Ephesians 6:6 calls Christ-followers to a
much higher work standard. As “slaves of Christ” we are to work at our jobs like those doing the will of
God from our hearts. So, how about it, at your job or at school or at home, are you working to please
people by just looking busy or are you working to please God as a Slave of Christ?
Ephesians 6:7 urges us to, “Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people.”
This word “wholeheartedly” is actually defined as “a state of zeal…[and] eagerness” In fact, “an
equivalent of ‘serve wholeheartedly’ could be expressed…as to ‘serve because you really want to.’”
9
Now, keep in mind, Paul is writing this to Christian slaves in the Ephesian church. Their work ethic is
being radically defined and transformed by embracing a perspective of serving the Lord, not people. How might this kind of perspective transform your attitude and motivation at work? It’s worth
pondering. Ephesians 6:8 reveals the ultimate motivation for servant-mindedness in the workplace:
“because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are
slave or free.” It’s significant for us to recognize that by addressing the slaves with instructions about
God-honoring attitudes and working for the Lord’s reward, Paul is explicitly recognizing slaves as
much more than someone’s else’s property. Slaves “are treated as ethically responsible persons”
who are just as much a part of the Christian congregation as were their masters who were receiving
the same letter from the Apostle Paul.10 11
The motivation for servant-mindedness in the workplace is REWARD from God; and it’s a really
amazing reward in at least 4 ways:12 1. It’s a future reward that motivates us in the here and now. V. 8
says “the Lord WILL reward,” future tense. And God keeps His promises, you can take that to the
bank. This motivates us to work hard in our current jobs!
2. It’s a reward for “EACH ONE,” regardless of whether they are slave or free. The slave/master
distinction will not affect the scope or size of the reward because there is no favoritism with God. So,
when we all get to heaven, there will not be any out of balance stock options or HUGE bonuses for
the few executives at the top. God will not play favorites.
3. It’s a reward based on one simple criterion: the good that each person has done.13 There won’t
be any smooth talking our way out of this one or listing all of the good things we had meant to do or
were about to do. 2 Corinthians 5:7, 9-10 reminds us, “For we live by faith, not by sight…So we make
it our goal to please him, …For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each of
us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.” Let’s be
clear, this is not about good works helping us earn our salvation. We talked about being saved by
grace alone through faith in Christ alone back in Ephesians 2:8-9. Ephesians 6:8 is talking about God
rewarding His people for the good they have done during their time as followers here on earth; for the
way that they steward their time, talents, and treasure.14
4. It’s a reward that comes despite whether our earthly bosses ever even notice. Back in v. 6 we
learned that it’s not appropriate to try and please our earthly bosses by pretending to work with mere
“eye-service.” 2 Chronicles 16:9a assures us, “For the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth
to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him…” Therefore, God sees everything and
He knows about the hard work that you try to do each and every day with a Christ-like attitude and
motivation. And, He will reward you as you strive for that!
Ephesians 6:9 moves our focus to those who are in charge of the workplace: “And masters, treat
your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master
and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him.”
Godly bosses have a servant-minded attitude and motivation in their workplace. When v. 9
mentions treating slaves “in the same way,” it’s a cue for godly bosses to embrace the SAME servantminded
attitudes that we just read about in vv. 5-8. Therefore, they should not be issuing threats
against their employees but rather leading out of reverence for God. They should conduct themselves
with sincerity, doing the will of God from their hearts. Godly bosses should lead in the same way that
the employees are called to follow: wholeheartedly, as if serving the Lord, not people. It’s a call to be
servant-minded as the person in charge at the workplace. So, Christian bosses are still expected to
be in charge and to lead, but it should look much different than other bosses who do not fear God.
You are serving the Lord as you lead your employees.
And bosses will be motivated “in the same way;” by the SAME 4 reward motivations that we talked
about for employees: 1. It’s a future reward that motivates us in the here and now. 2. It’s a reward for
“EACH ONE,” regardless of whether they are slave or free. 3. It’s a reward based on one simple
criterion: the good that each person has done. And although bosses should not expect some higher level of executive bonus, they can certainly expect a fair and equal reward for their good leadership
while on earth. 4. It’s a reward that comes despite whether our earthly bosses ever even notice. Even
earthly bosses have bosses that don’t always see or reward their hard work. But God see it all and
rewards it accordingly!
Ephesians 6:9 now brings our discussion on the overarching topic of submission to a close. It’s a
fitting bookend to an idea that we have been meditating on for 3 Sundays now: In a society that
unfairly favored men, one of the key messages throughout Ephesians 5:21-6:9 is for men to step up
and become sacrificial, kind, and considerate leaders! God’s Word calls out the MEN in particular, to
be Christ-like husbands, fathers, and bosses. They are challenged to embrace a Christian world-view
where women, children, and employees are worthy of dignity; each one a person created in the
image of God; of great worth and of equal value. And so, there is no place in godly households or
businesses for any kind of abuse or mistreatment of women, children, or employees. Anyone here
who is suffering abuse at their job or in their home can get help today. Talk with someone before you
leave church today.
Ephesians 5-6 puts forth a strong challenge to the Christians living in Roman society to use their
positions of leadership to serve and to be kind to those who follow them. They are given a godly
vision of what it means to truly be the servant-leaders that God intends them to be. There’s a play on
words here between v. 9’s reference to our Heavenly Master and v. 5’s reference to earthly masters.
Ephesians 6:9 now culminates this entire section with a strong reminder to all of us, that God is the
Heavenly Master of us all. He will show no favoritism or special treatment to anyone whether they are
male or female, parent or child, slave or master. Indeed, the Christ-following slaves and masters in
Ephesus were “fellow-slaves of the same Lord.”15 They have the same Master in heaven which
means they humbly stand TOGETHER on level ground and have equal status before God.16 Let’s
also remember the continuing reality of Ephesians 5:18, which says to “be filled with the Spirit.” In
order for Christian bosses and employees to be empowered for servant-mindedness, they will each
need a daily filling of God’s Spirit.
A good way of summarizing Ephesians 6:5-9 is that For Christ-followers, work is an
opportunity to worship. Even as employees work hard for their bosses and as bosses lead well on
behalf of their employees, each one has the opportunity to bring God glory. If you’d like to learn more
about this, read the book Work Matters by Tom Nelson.17 Right now, take a minute to look up this
brief video called “Work as Worship:” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m06DYIAeCtU It illustrates the
concept of Work as Worship. What is your mission in the marketplace? Are you an employee, who
works hard out of reverence for Christ? Are you a boss, who treats your employees well out of
reverence for Christ? Whatever your situation, embrace your opportunity, as a Christ-follower, to
worship God in your workplace!

",Jerry Johnson,"Bemidji, MN",1/22/2017,
"This morning we’re going to look at some of Bible’s teaching about family. Family
Matters do not always fit within a neatly defined box. An honest examination of anyone’s
family background reveals at least a few knots in the family tree. Family Matters are
messy for most of us. Somewhere along the branches, most of us have been touched by some level of
disruption, disorder, or dysfunction.
Encouragingly, some of the most difficult aspects of family dysfunction can grow into a beautiful
tapestry through God’s gracious and loving restoration. Many of us have been blessed by family “figures,”
other than our own biological relatives. They’ve become the mom or dad, brother or sister, or son or
daughter that we’ve always wanted. Some of us have had a g-parent, an aunt or an uncle, or some other
friend who has come alongside to help out along the way. Whatever our particular family configuration,
there is a way forward through the grace and truth of Jesus Christ. The Bible is filled with encouraging
messages like the one found in Ps. 68:6, “God sets the lonely in families.”
Nobody told me that parenting would be so challengeing… and rewarding; so frustrating… and
fulfilling. Nobody trained me in Parenting 101 or sent me to school to get an education to help me be
ready for parenthood. I’m pretty sure that I thought to myself, “how tough can it be, to be a parent, right?
Lots of people have done it. None of THEM had any training either.” Well, if you haven’t already figured
this out on your own, let me assure you, parenting is a tough calling. It’s worth it, but it’s not for
wimps. There are times when every parent needs a little comedy relief; a little humor to help
them get through. That’s what I like about this comic. In case you can’t read it, the back of the 3
camels say, “Our son is an honor student, our son is in medical school, and our Son is God!”
Then, the comment in the upper left says, “Well! If it isn’t Joseph and Mary!”
When Paul writes to the Ephesian Christ-followers about parents/children, he only gives them
4 verses; about 60 words total. It feels like he’s not giving us a whole lot to go on here. But as we
dig in together, we’ll discover a lot that applies to our lives. Ephesians 6:1 begins by addressing the
children 1st
. “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.” Family Matters call children to obey.
This sounds simple enough; obey your parents’ rules while you’re living under their roof. V. 1 tells children
to do this because it’s the right thing to do. But I’m not sure, that we truly realize, just how profound, this
simple truth is. This is the 5
th commandment1 of the 10 Commandments, which goes to show, that
obedience to parents, is a key aspect in a person’s relationship to God.
2
However, I’m afraid we may have developed a tendency, as American Christians, to think, “oh, lighten
up a little, after all, kids will be kids.” This verb for “obey” is an imperative, which means that it’s a
command. We are not talking about the same kind of voluntary submission we learned about last week
regarding the husband/wife relationship. Between parents and children, this notion of submission “denotes
absolute obedience.”3 Have you ever noticed how serious the Bible is about children obeying their
parents? One sobering example is found in Romans 1 which includes the phrase, “they disobey their
parents.” It’s startling to read through the sins listed around that phrase: Rom. 1:29-32 is talking about
godless people:
“They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of
envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and
boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents; they have no understanding, no
fidelity, no love, no mercy. Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things
deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice
them.”4
It catches you off guard a little, doesn’t it? But there it is, right in the middle of that list! Apparently, this
simple instruction to “obey your parents in the Lord,” may be a bigger deal than we make it out to be. God
wants children to obey their parents because it’s the right thing to do. As our Heavenly Father and our
Creator, we can trust that God knows what is best for people. So, if He says, that obeying our parents is
really important, then we’ll want to embrace that behavior. Colossians 3:20 gives us this assurance:
“Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.” By the way, this includes obeying
our parents, even if they are not Christians. They are still in a position of authority over us.5 And, it is
pleasing to God for us to obey them.
This pleasing obedience in v. 1, leads us right into Ephesians 6:2-3, “‘Honor your father and mother’—
which is the first commandment with a promise—‘so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy
long life on the earth.’” Family matters through a lifetime of honor. Paul is quoting from Dt. 5:16 which
says, “Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may
live long and that it may go well with you in the land the LORD your God is giving you.” So, this original
Old Testament reference, is connected to the blessing of the Promised Land, which God’s People were
about to enter. And now Paul, writing to the Ephesian believers, applies God’s promised blessing in a
more general way6
in Ephesians 6:2-3. Therefore, it is not only right to obey our parents in v. 1, but there
is also a promise in vv. 2-3 of God’s lifetime blessing when we honor them. Although this is not a
guarantee that you’ll live to be 100 years old, there is a general principle that holds true here. Living God’s
way, by obeying His commandment to honor your father and mother, will contribute toward enjoying a
good life and living a long time.7
Some of us might be wondering, what about adult children? Once we move out of the house, are we
still called to honor our parents? I think most of us would admit that we don’t suddenly stop being
someone’s child at a certain age, whether that be 18 or 21 or whatever. The term “child” usually denotes a
relationship rather than a particular age.”8 So, many of us continue to be a son or daughter well beyond
age 21. Even now, as a 46-year-old man, I am my dad and mom’s child. And no matter how embarrassing
it may be at times; my mom, IN PUBLIC, STILL calls me her little “Baby Bear!” That can be a little
awkward but to be honest I still kind of like it a little too. And although I don’t live under their roof any
longer, or obey their specific house rules in the same way I did as a kid, I’m still called to honor my
parents.
One example of this in Scripture is when the Apostle Paul gives directions to Timothy. He explains that
Christ-followers, as adult children, should continue to honor their aging parents. Take a look at 1 Timothy
5:4&8: “But if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into
practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing
to God. …Anyone who does not provide for their relatives, and especially for their own household, has
denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.”9
It is pleasing to God when adult children take care of
their parents and grandparents. Even as adults, we have an ongoing responsibility to honor our father and
mother.
10
To honor someone means to show high regard for them and respect them.11 Honoring our parents is
about attributing a high status to them, and assigning them to a place of prominence and importance.12
Frankly, honoring is quite a bit more challenging than obeying. And it’s at this point that we need to once
again take a step back and look at the broader context of Ephesians 5:21-6:9. This entire section on
husbands/wives, parents/children, and masters/slaves begins with the admonition in Ephesians 5:21 to,
“Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.” And that hinge verse for this entire section is linked
back to the primary imperative in Ephesians 5:18, “…be filled with the Spirit.” So, submitting to our parents is motivated by our reverence for Christ. And, it is empowered by the Holy Spirit who fills us each
day with the power that we need to honor our parents throughout our lifetime.13
Ephesians 6:4 goes on to zero-in on dads: “Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring
them up in the training and instruction of the Lord.”14 Family Matters call parents to bring children UP. Paul
wants fathers in particular to pay attention to v. 4. So, all the dads out there, let’s be sure that we look at
this carefully. To exasperate15 someone means “to make them angry.” Its synonyms include “to frustrate,
irritate, or annoy.” So, fathers are specifically being cautioned about making their children angry or
frustrating them.16 That’s something for us to ponder. As we consider some of the ways, that this may be
occurring in our homes, it’s something for us to talk to God about. Despite a father’s leadership as head of
his home, “fathers must surrender any right, they may feel they have, to act unreasonably toward their
children.”17 Bible scholar Andrew Lincoln summarizes it this way, the Apostle Paul is essentially ruling out
‘excessively severe discipline, unreasonably harsh demands, abuse of authority, arbitrariness, unfairness,
constant nagging and condemnation, subjecting a child to humiliation, and all forms of gross insensitivity
to a child’s needs and sensibilities.”18 Colossians 3:21 puts it more succinctly, “Fathers, do not embitter
your children, or they will become discouraged.”
Last week, we learned that Roman society unfairly favored men, permitting them to rule in
authoritarian and iron-fisted ways in their homes. This meant that they could pretty do or say whatever
they wanted to in the privacy of their own homes. But, one of the key messages in Ephesians 5:21-6:9 is
for men to step up and become sacrificial, kind, and considerate leaders! This applies to our parenting as
well. Rather than tearing our kids DOWN, we are urged to bring them UP! Ephesians 6:4 says, “Fathers,
do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them UP in the training and instruction of the Lord.”19
The last part of v. 4 is the positive call to action.
20 As Christian fathers, we have a wonderful opportunity to
nourish our children; through things like encouraging them verbally, coaching them through challenges, training them to do things, through appropriate discipline and bringing them UP in their overall maturity as
men and women of God.
21 “Human fathers, are to care for their families, as God the Father cares for
His.”22
Now, it’s important to note, that the broader context of Scripture does make it clear that husbands
AND wives are actually in this together.23 So, although dads ARE given a clear instruction in Ephesians
6:4, we should NOT conclude that they are the only ones with the task of bringing children up in the
training and instruction of the Lord.
24 For example: Proverbs 1:8 says, “Listen, my son, to your father’s
instruction and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.” And Proverbs 31:1 talks about, “The sayings of
King Lemuel25—an inspired utterance his mother taught him.” Therefore, dads and moms are in this
together.
It’s important that we don’t miss the final 3 words of this morning’s passage. Ephesians 6:4 says,
“Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them UP in the training and instruction of the
Lord.” This is a wonderful reminder of the incredible calling on our lives. Parents, dads AND moms, are
God’s chosen instruments on behalf of their children. They are entrusted with bringing them up according
to those things which are pleasing to the Lord.26 What an amazing purpose and mission for our lives! And
some of us, are even blessed with the opportunity, to be a stay-at-home parent! How cool is that!? Family
matters to God and He uses it to accomplish His purposes in our world.
There’s an intriguing parallel between the v. 4 phrase “of the Lord” and the v. 1 phrase “in the Lord.”
Both of these little prepositional phrases are important. They emphasize that Family Matters are directly
connected to Faith Matters, our fellowship with the Lord and our obedience to Him.”27 As Christian moms
and dads allow their own daily lives to be impacted by following Jesus, they serve the Lord by helping
their children learn about faith in Christ. This whole structure of the family is designed by God for the
mutual benefit of everyone living within the family structure. And, this is designed to bring God glory. In
any family, no matter how difficult the situation. No matter whether we are talking about biological children
or foster-care or adopted or step-children or whatever. We can glorify God in our particular family
situation!
Sure, Family Matters can be messy, challenging, and even awkward at times, but the fact still remains,
God has designed people to function best, when they embrace their role in healthy-functioning, Godhonoring
relationship structures. 28 So, whether you have a more traditional family or whether you are a
single parent or a remarried couple with a blended family or whatever else, choose today to bring
yourselves under the blessing, protection, and beauty of God’s structure for a Christian Family. Choose to
be a family who chooses to follow Christ, and let Him redeem your relationships into something blessed
by God. Choose to say along with Joshua 24:15, “...But as for me and my household, we will serve the
LORD.”

"This morning’s passage paints a beautiful picture of love and respect within a
Christian Marriage. It presents a vision of how together, as one flesh, a husband and wife can magnify the
beauty of Christ and His Church. Take a minute right now and read Ephesians 5:21-331 Love and respect. This
is God’s glorious design for the marriage relationship. It was His idea. Christian Marriage is something
beautifully designed by God for the MUTUAL joy and benefit of a husband and wife. And, it also brings glory to
God.
The last time we were in Ephesians together we were in 5:18-21 which taught us to “be filled with the Spirit”
daily.2 Right at the end, v. 21 introduces the topic of submission and leads us into 3 subcategories which will
be a 3-week sermon series for us: husbands/wives, parents/children, and masters/servants. The topic of
submission causes quite a few ripples in our modern-day society. Well, ok, let’s be real, it has caused HUGE,
crashing waves of concern and confusion. So, we need to talk about submission a bit. But, before we get
totally immersed in this one word, let’s step back and look at the broader, and frankly more important, context
of Ephesians 5:21-6:9.
2,000 years ago, it was a very male-dominated society. The Roman world in which the Ephesians Christfollowers
were living gave full authority to men to lead in a harsh, authoritarian, and iron-fisted way. But Paul,
by stark contrast, is calling the male Christ-followers to a much higher standard of love and kindness than that
which was found in the surrounding Graeco-Roman world.3
In Ephesians 5, Paul says to Christ-followers: “this
is how you should behave in the midst of your non-Christian neighbors.” In a society that unfairly favored men,
one of the key messages in Ephesians 5:21-6:9 is for men to step up and become sacrificial, kind, and
considerate leaders!
Paul calls out the MEN in particular, to be Christ-like; Christ-like husbands, Christ-like fathers, and Christlike
in their treatment of the slaves in their employment. They are challenged to embrace a Christian worldview
where women, children, and slaves were worthy of dignity; each one a person created in the image of
God; of great worth and of equal value.
Ironically, we’ve come to view this Ephesians 5 passage as somehow misogynistic or repressive. It’s
actually quite the opposite. Here the Apostle Paul, under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, is writing to help
relationships thrive and flourish. He puts forth a bold and strong challenge to the Christian men living in Roman
society to use their positions of leadership to serve and to be kind to those who follow them. He calls them to
be husbands, fathers, and bosses that live in reverent fear of their Master in Heaven. Men are given a godly
vision of what it means to truly be the servant-leaders that God intends them to be. Ephesians 6:9 culminates
this section with a strong reminder to men that God is their Master as well, and He will show them no favoritism
just because they are male.
In the midst of a world that favored men, one of the key messages in Ephesians 5:21-6:9 is for men to step
up and become sacrificial, kind, and considerate leaders! With this in mind, let’s talk about submission for a
while this morning. It’s right here at the beginning of our text. Ephesians 5:21-22 says to, “Submit to one
another out of reverence for Christ. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord.” Biblical Submission is about embracing one’s role in a healthy-functioning, God-honoring relationship
structure.4 The word for submit in v. 21 is “????????”5
in the Greek. It’s a passive participle which means “to
order oneself under” a leader… or to “submit oneself voluntarily.”6
“The use of the middle voice of this verb
emphasizes the voluntary character of the submission.”7 Therefore, Biblical Submission is NOT a forced
submission.
Submission is not about inferiority or a “2nd class” status at all; not even close! If we examine the
approximately 40 occurrences of this verb in the NT, we find a pattern. It is intended that there be a healthyfunctioning,
God-honoring aspect to EVERY relationship structure.
In 1 Corinthians 15:28, we see Jesus the Son submitting to God the Father:
""When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so
that God may be all in all.” “Be made subject to” is the same Greek word we find in Ephesians 5, “????????.”
So clearly this is not about inferiority or “2nd class” status. The doctrine of the Trinity clearly presents
Father/Son/HS “existing in a loving unity of three equally divine Persons.”8 Therefore, as Jesus submits to His
Heavenly Father, it in no way suggests “that the Son is in any way inferior to the Father.”
9 Jesus’ submission to
God the Father demonstrates “a functional subordination without implying inferiority, or less honour and
glory.”10 Thus, having equal worth and distinctive roles is entirely possible.
In 1 Peter 2:13&17 we find citizens submitting themselves to the governing structure. Once again, it uses
this same word, “????????.” “Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human authority…Show proper
respect to everyone, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the emperor.” Clearly, this is about the role
and function that each one of us can enjoy as citizens living in a structured society that benefits from the
orderly operation of various relationships. Biblical Submission is about embracing one’s role in a healthyfunctioning,
God-honoring relationship structure.11
In Ephesians 5:21-6:9, we once again find the exact same verb “????????.” We see a picture of various
roles and functions in the orderly operation of household relationship structures: wives submitting to their
husband’s lead, children honoring and obeying their parents, and slaves obeying and working hard for their
masters.12 “Submission is a humble recognition of [God’s] divine ordering.”13 Each Christ-follower must choose
whether to accept it or reject it. But, once we understand Biblical Submission, as the beautiful design of God,
then we can gladly embrace it.
Let’s recognize 2 important observations about Biblical Submission. 1. The attitudes and actions of
submission are empowered by the HS. Grammatically, the participle “submit” in v. 21 is dependent on the
earlier imperative from v. 18 “be filled with the HS.” So, we could summarize this thought as “Be filled with the
Spirit, so that you are empowered to submit to one another.” We will not be able to practice submission in our
relationships with one another apart from the reality of being filled with God’s Holy Spirit.
2. The attitudes and actions of submission are motivated by reverence for Christ.14 Note v. 21 again.
Biblical submission to one another begins and ends in an atmosphere of reverence for Christ and
respect for His design in our relationships. Biblical submission has never been a manmade
concept; it has always been intended as something prompted by respect for Jesus Christ.
Christian Marriage is designed to be like a dance where a husband leads and his wife
follows and TOGETHER, in unison, they create something BEAUTIFUL. Rather than stepping on each other’s toes or crashing into everyone else on the dance floor, they glide along together in an
amazing blend of synergy and artistry. Take 2 minutes to go on your computer and watch this 1936 video of
Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlvp8PUnC2Y
From the twirl of her dress to the tapping of his shoes, the music makes sense and brings them both great
joy as they work TOGETHER toward something greater than their individual selves could have ever
accomplished. We see here a glimpse of the wisdom and grandeur of God’s plan at work. Christian Marriage is
beautifully designed for the MUTUAL joy and benefit of husband and wife TOGETHER in this dance we call
life. And when it’s approached with love and respect, in MUTUAL reverence for Christ, it brings God great
glory!
Christian Marriage is a beautiful relationship structure that is designed to bring God glory through 4
things…
1. … the mutual support and building up of each other.
HUSBANDS: Easily 2/3 of the verses in Ephesians 5:21-33, are directed towards us. We would do well to pay
attention to them this morning. God has put an amazing calling on the life of every husband to love their wife
JUST AS Christ loved the church! We’re called to make her holy, supporting and building her up. We husbands
are to present her as someone radiant. Husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies; to provide and
care for her JUST AS Christ does the church. Christ did not abuse or neglect His church, rather He took abuse
and suffered neglect on her behalf! He took the physical, emotional, and mental pain upon Himself; He did not
dole it out upon her. Christ did NOT use His power and position as something to be wielded over His Bride. He
bore His power as a responsibility and a weight upon His shoulders to sacrificially serve in the church’s best
interests.
15 And He did this gladly, out of love.
Submission is not a hammer to be used by husbands to force their wives to obey them. This would be
directly opposite of the beauty and glory of what Christian marriage is intended to be. Husbands, we should
never, ever abuse our wives! We should not physically strike her, verbally attack her, or emotionally abandon
her. She is our bride as the Church is the Bride of Christ. Some of us might think we can get away with doing
whatever and saying whatever we want to, in the privacy of your own home. But God sees right into your home
and right into your heart. And He will hold you accountable. On the day of judgement, he will tell you to brace
yourself like a man and answer for how you abused your wife. If you do not repent, and change your behavior
now, you will find yourself suffering under the wrath of God. And women, if you or someone you know, is
enduring an abusive relationship, get out! You are not expected to submit to that. That is NOT Biblical
Submission. That is not what God’s Word is teaching this morning. Our Loving God does not expect you to
endure abuse!
WIVES: The other 1/3 of these verses are addressed to you. Your husband needs your respect. He needs
you to build him up and support him. Your encouragement, your prayers, your mutual devotion means the
world to him. I know this because I’m a guy and I’ve talked to lots of guys. We may not often show it, but we
can be a little fragile at times. Genesis tells us that it wasn’t good for man to be alone. Oh, there are a
few of us who’ve been called to the single life, but most of us… we need a helpmate. We are sinful and
imperfect men, but we are trying to be the godly head of our homes. As we husbands strive toward this calling,
we need to know that you’ll voluntarily follow us, that you’ll stick by our side for better or worse, for richer or
poorer, in sickness and in health.
A 2nd way that Christian Marriage brings God glory is through… 2. … personal spiritual growth in men and
women as followers of Christ. HUSBANDS: We take our cues directly from our Lord Jesus. A key point in our
growth as Christ-followers is learning to die to ourselves every day. We must take up the art of learning to
sacrificially love our wives by laying down our lives. As we learn to embrace this beautiful and challenging goal,
we will find ourselves growing spiritually, by leaps and bounds, into the strong, godly man that God intends us
to be.
16
WIVES: embracing the teaching of Ephesians 5:22-24 becomes a key point of your personal spiritual
growth as a Christ-follower. As you voluntarily choose to submit to your husband, you are, in that very act,
submitting to Lordship of Christ in your life. Following your husband’s leadership is “part and parcel of the way”
you serve the Lord and grow into a mature woman of God. Another way that Christian Marriage brings God glory is through… 3. … an effective witness to not yet
believers.
HUSBANDS: There are so many men in our Bemidji community that have no idea what it means to truly love a
woman. They are desperately in need of a stable relationship, but they have no idea how to even begin.
And they are miserable, unhappy, and dissatisfied with life. They need our Christian example. They need to
see what Christ-like chivalry looks like. They need to know that male chauvinism and harsh treatment of
women is wrong; that women are NOT just objects to be used for our selfish pleasure. They need you to show
them that the way to the heart of a woman is by first having a heart for the Lord.
WIVES: 1 Peter 3:1-2 says, “Wives, in the same way submit yourselves to your own husbands so that, if
any of them do not believe the word, they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives, when
they see the purity and reverence of your lives.”18 Unsaved spouses can be won over to the Lord by our
Christian witness.
There are many women in our Bemidji community that have no idea what it means to live a pure and
reverent life. The idea of submitting to their husbands out of reverence for Christ is a completely foreign idea to
them. So many of them, are longing in their hearts for a meaningful relationship with a godly man, but they
don’t have the spiritual maturity to anchor their convictions. They need your Christian example. They need to
see what Christ-like femininity looks like; to treasure the unfading beauty of their inner selves. You can help
them break the painful cycle of trying to measure up, and then continually hitting a wall of rejection and
disappointment. They need to know that their value comes from God, not from how they look on the outside.
One final way that Christian Marriage brings God glory is through… 4. … modeling itself after Christ and
His Church. Now, we’ve pretty much been talking about this all along. But let me state this succinctly:
HUSBANDS: Christ is your model for how to love your wife. As Christ laid down His life as Savior of the
Church, so you must lay down your life for the sake of your wife. By loving your wife this way, you will bring
God great glory.
WIVES: The Church’s reverence for Christ is your model for how to respect your husband. Rather than
resisting your husband’s leadership, chose to voluntarily and joyfully submit to him as the head of your home.
19
By respecting your husband this way, you will bring God great glory.
Christian Marriage is something beautifully designed by God for the MUTUAL joy and benefit of a
husband and wife. Love and respect. No one said that marriage was going to be easy. But we have the
assurance from God’s Word that it is indeed His good gift.",Jerry Johnson,"Bemidji, MN",1/8/2017,
"Introduction: why does Christmas matter?
Twas the week after Christmas and all through the house,
Not a creature was skinny, not even the mouse.
Our bellies were stuffed full of cookies and pies,
And we thought we’d cut back, but the scale never lies.
The house, which before was all cleaned for our guests,
Seemed now a fit place for owls to make nests,
With the tangles of ribbon and boxes galore,
And torn wrapping paper knee-deep on the floor.
The children were running about with their toys,
Which were mostly broken, but for those which made noise
And kept me awake as I tried to expire
In my new dog-chewed slippers by a smoldering fire.
“Our waistlines are thick and our wallets are thin.”
I thought as I sank to my chair with a grin.
“I suppose that this holiday just barely pays,
Since it comes every three-hundred-sixty-five days.”
Do any of you ever feel like that after Christmas? Do you ever feel like “Now, was that really worth all the
trouble?” I know, it’s terrible to say that out loud. But I’m guessing I’m not the only one who’s felt that
way. Think about all the time we spend gearing up for Christmas. We have four weeks of Advent. Prime
shopping season starts the day after Thanksgiving. (Or back in September if you work in retail.) The
excitement builds gradually throughout December as we listen to our Christmas music, have our parties and
concerts, and make big plans for the family get-together. Or from a kid’s perspective, as the pile of presents
under the tree gradually grows, the level of excitement builds and builds until they can hardly stand it any
longer. Finally, Christmas Eve and Christmas Day arrive.
And then December 26 comes. You’ve spent over a month preparing, and after one day it’s all said and
done. The Christmas music stops playing. You usually stop hearing Christmas sermons. I realize that I’m
breaking that rule today. But for the most part Life pretty much goes back to normal. And what do you have to
show for it, other than a messy house, a few extra pounds, and maybe a few nice things that (chances are) you
didn’t really need? And now there’s all the clean-up work. You’ll have to take down the decorations and the tree
and pack away that nativity set. So I repeat my question: “Is Christmas really worth all the trouble?”
You didn’t know you’d be hearing such a depressing sermon today, did you? Maybe you’re wondering who
invited the Grinch to preach this Sunday! But all exaggerations aside, I’ve hit on something real here,
right? Christmas is fun and exciting, but it can be overwhelming too, and we sometimes can find ourselves
wondering why we make such a big deal out of it when after it’s over life really just goes back to normal. What
really is the big deal about Christmas? What difference does it really make for the rest of the year?
That’s a question I’d like to reflect on longer. In one sense, we all know the answer to that question. Why is
Christmas a big deal? There’s an answer that I expect all of you know, and it starts with the letter J: Jesus! We
frequently remind ourselves that “Jesus is the reason for the season.” That’s true, of course. And yet, Jesus
isn’t just the reason during one season. He’s not like Santa Claus who only shows up one night of the
year. Jesus is the reason for the whole year. He’s the reason for the decade, the century, the millennium! In
fact, when we read John chapter one, we realize that Jesus as the creator is the reason for all of time and
space. How does one day (or even twenty five days) of celebration do justice to him? If Jesus is the reason for
all of life, how can we just put him back in the box with rest of the decorations when Christmas is over?
The Exodus and the Problem of Human Forgetfulness
I’m afraid that many of us are probably guilty of doing just that. Why? It’s human nature. We’re fickle and
forgetful. There’s a story that illustrates this wonderfully. It’s a true story, and we read in the Old Testament
book of Exodus.
The children of Israel were in Egypt. They’d been trapped in slavery there for over 400 years. They thought
God had forgotten them. And just when things were at their worst, when the Pharaoh began killing their children,
we are told their cry went up to God, and he remembered them (Ex. 2:23-25). That’s a strange comment, saying
that God remembered. Has God ever been known to forget anything? This sense of remembering has less to
do with knowing something or a recalling a fact, than it has to do with taking action to fulfill a promise or to be
faithful to a relationship. When God remembered his people, it’s a way of saying that the time had come for him
to fulfill the promises he had made to them. He was going to act according to what he said he would do.
And God follows through. He rescues his people, but it’s no walk in the park. After motivating a reluctant
Moses, confronting a wicked pharaoh, pouring out ten destructive plagues, sending down a pillar of fire, parting
the Red Sea, and sending manna and quail to feed the people in the wilderness, God left nothing to doubt about
whether he was real or whether He remembered his promises to his people.
But notice what happens next. God leads the people to Mt. Sinai. Moses goes up the mountain for a few
weeks, and what do the people do? They conclude that God has forgotten them. They give up on God and
make a new god for themselves. Moses returns to find them worshiping a golden calf. God hadn’t forgotten
them, but they had forgotten him.
That seems a bit hard for us to imagine. After just witnessing the miraculous, saving power of God, how
could they so quickly lose their faith in him? How could they so quickly move from following Yahweh, the Living
God, to worshiping their jewelry? How could they forget so easily?
But is it perhaps possible that these people were more like us than we would care to admit? Think about
it. After the all the excitement of the plagues and the red sea crossing began to wear off, perhaps life began to
start feeling rather normal. Because maybe people thirty-four hundred years ago are a lot like us, and they
easily become bored with the humdrum routine of daily life. So maybe when they were sitting under Mt. Sinai,
they forget about who God was, not because they had such bad memories that they literally forgot what had just
happened to them. Think about that sense of remembering that we just talked about when we said that God
remembered his people. Remembering in that sense means not just recalling a fact but living up to a promise or
being faithful in a relationship. That’s the sense in which the people forgot about God. They didn’t forget what
had happened, or that God existed, but they were unfaithful to him. They didn’t put their trust in him. In short,
they were fickle, unfaithful people in relationship with a faithful, unchanging God, and something as short as a
month or two without a big show from him led them to conclude that he has abandoned them. So what if God
split the Red Sea for us? Sure, we’d get excited. But maybe, we’d stop thinking about it sooner than we care to
admit. Maybe, we’d even start to wonder if God was still there.
That’s my point here. As human beings, we are fickle and forgetful. Whatever big thing happens to us, life
soon goes back to normal and we live like we’ve forgotten it even if we still remember it mentally.
Let's look at a more trivial example. What happens when you get a wonderful Christmas gift from a family
member? Some of you can probably think of something right now. But Christmas gifts are usually just like any
other new thing we get: the excitement wears off soon, and that gift becomes just another thing in the house. No
matter how useful or nice or fun it is, it still doesn’t change how you look at life much. And why should it? It’s
just another physical possession.
But what if God gave you a truly life-changing gift? The fact is, God has given us an amazing gift. God gave
the greatest gift he has ever given in Bethlehem 2,000 years ago. And we know that! We know that it changed
the world. We probably even know that Jesus has changed each of our lives. But does that baby born in
ancient Palestine really affect the way that we view life every day?
As we think about that, let’s go back and look at John chapter 1. This chapter is incredibly rich in theology,
and it would probably take a whole sermon series to unpack it, but I’d like to make just a few observations about
what it says about Jesus.
Jesus is the Eternal Creator.
Firstly, Jesus is eternal. John refers to Jesus as the Word, and explains that not only was Jesus with God in
the beginning and that he created the world, but that in fact, Jesus was God. And if Jesus was God, then he still
is God. The same Jesus who came into the world in Bethlehem and who we celebrate at Christmas is the
eternal God who created us and the whole universe and who is Lord over us now. That means that Jesus’ birth
is more than just another historical event: It means that Jesus is both the central figure of history is still present
with us now as Lord.
Jesus the eternal creator entered his own rebel world.
But there’s more to it than that. “The word became flesh and made his dwelling among us” (14). The eternal,
holy and perfect God entered into the midst of a world full of pain and brokenness and sin and evil. John writes
“In him was life and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has 
not overcome it.” Verses 10 and 11 describe the same thing. “He was in the world and though the world was
made through him, the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own, but his own did not
receive him.”
There’s a tragic kind of irony there: God is being treated like an exile and a foreigner in his own creation. He
came bringing light into a world that barely knew what light was. That’s the reason why Christ’s coming to earth,
out of the thousands of years of human history, becomes the central event. Not only did the creator God step
into his own creation. He stepped right into its pain, from the very first by being born through the painful
experience of childbirth through which all humans enter the world. In his life he surrounded himself with people
in pain, and ultimately, he himself died nailed to a Roman cross, carrying the pain and suffering, the guilt and the
shame, of all humanity; the very people who betrayed him.
Jesus offers his rebel world the chance to receive and become children of God.
John continues to explain that Jesus came so that we might receive him, and that, by God’s grace, we might
become children of God. John writes “Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave
the right to be become children of God” (12). We who were God’s enemies, and have no right to be anything
else, have been brought into God’s family because of Jesus.
Application: Remember, Receive, and Rejoice.
So, let’s go back to the question we asked earlier; how should Christ’s coming into this world affect the way
we look at everyday life? Because the gift God has given to us through Jesus is not a nice-Christmas-present
kind of gift that doesn’t really change us much. It’s a walking-through-the-Red-Sea kind of gift, and it changes
everything. How do we live in the light of that reality? Let’s think about three responses: Remember, Receive,
and Rejoice.
Remember
First: Remember Jesus. As John is reflecting on the profound meaning of who Jesus was and what he did,
he is calling his readers to remember the significance of Jesus. Again, this is the kind of remembering that is
more than recalling an event, but is about being faithful to a relationship. It’s about remembering a person, not
just a fact. Think about remembering your wedding anniversary or your best friend’s birthday. You don’t
remember those things just because they are facts about something that happened a long time ago. You
remember them because that person is still alive and you have a relationship with him or her. And we remember
Jesus because he is still alive and has a relationship with us. We read in John that he is the eternal, living God
who was Lord of creation, of the manger, of the cross, and of this Sunday morning. He is the Lord of history who
stepped down into history to bring light into a dark world; to make us children of God.
So let’s not be like the Israelites who might have remembered the event of walking through the Red Sea, but
forgot the One who did it for them as they walked through the wilderness. Jesus is Lord not only of our Red
Seas, but also of our long, dull wilderness treks. Now, maybe God is showing up in your life right now in a
powerful, amazing way. And that’s wonderful! Rejoice in that! But maybe he seems quiet. You’re going
through a spiritual dry spell. Maybe you wonder if God is even there. We need to learn how to rejoice in those
times too. Sometimes that means that we just keep walking in faith, putting one foot in front of the other even
when we can’t see the path ahead. We need to trust Jesus--to remember him—in all of the ordinary days and
weeks that fill our year. In other words, we don’t put Jesus back in the closet with the rest of the Christmas
decorations. We don’t treat him like that new gift that you have already gotten used to. He is our savior and
lord who is faithful to save us every day. He is there. He remembers us! We need to remember him.
One of the best ways to remember Jesus in this way is by regularly reading God’s word. Why do we read
the Bible? To gain more information about God? Yes, there is that, but it’s also more than that. We need to
read Scripture like we are reading a letter that has been personally addressed to us, because that is what the
Bible is. It is God’s written revelation of himself to us, and it’s been personally signed through the death and
resurrection of Jesus. We remember Jesus by regularly listening to him as we read Scripture and then
responding in obedience. Remembering Jesus is the dance of daily life, and the music to which we dance has
been written on the pages of Scripture.
Like I said before, we have some Bibles and Bible reading guides available in the Fellowship hall today. I
would encourage you to think about how you want to actively remember and listen to Jesus throughout the year
by reading and studying his word.
Receive
The second response is to receive Jesus. John tells us that those who receive Christ become the children of
God. If you have never received Jesus into life as your savior and lord, it is never too late or too early. That’s
the most important choice any of us can make.
But many of us have already received Jesus. Does that mean that we’re done? Isn’t receiving Jesus once
enough? Didn’t his death for us cover our sin once and for all?
The answer to that is, “Yes, absolutely! Jesus died once-and-for-all. Anyone who has received Jesus is a child
of God. But there is also a sense in which receiving Christ is something we need to do daily.
We can understand this better when we compare our relationship to Christ to the marriage relationship.
Think about the vows a couple make to one another on their wedding day. When they say “I do” and promise
their love and commitment to each other, that’s what marries them. They don’t need to get married again. It’s
“a done deal.”
But does that mean that after the wedding day, the couple can simply forget those vows, as though they were
just a hope to jump through? No, those vows are realities of their relationship that need to be lived out every
day. Each day, they need to choose love commitment for the other. All committed relationships are like that.
Receiving a person as a spouse or caring for someone as a friend is an everyday choice.
So just as we need to remember Jesus every day of the year, we also need to receive Jesus every
day. Those who receive Jesus become children of God, but as his children, we need to make a daily discipline
of receiving him and trusting him as our savior and lord.
Again, one of the ways we actively receive Jesus is by responding as we regularly read his word. The goal
of reading God’s word every day is so that we can both know God and obey him. Christian living is about the
regular discipline of saying yes to Jesus every day and in all situations. We read God’s word and then we say
“Yes, Lord. I want to live that way. I want to be that kind of a person. I want Jesus to be the center of my life,
the source of my identity and my hope. Help me be that kind of person, Lord!” In other words, we need to
receive Jesus daily as our savior and Lord.
Rejoice
Remember Christ, receive Christ, and finally, rejoice in Christ! He is the eternal God who brings us out of sin
and darkness and into his light. That is something really worth celebrating! We celebrate what Jesus has done
for us, and we also celebrate who he is.
So celebrate Christmas all year round! In January! In July! Go ahead. You can stop listening to Christmas
music. You can take down the tree. You can put the nativity scene back in the closet. And yes, you can stop
eating Christmas cookies. But don’t put Jesus back in the box with the ceramic nativity set. Don’t stuff him in
the closet with the lights. God coming in the flesh to die for us is the central event of history, and it’s the center
of our lives, too. So let’s daily remember that the baby in the manger is the Lord of all. Let’s continue to receive
him and trust in him as the one who came to die for us. And let us joyfully follow our resurrected Lord!
Tis the week after Christmas and Christ is still Lord.
His word remains sharp as a two-edged sword:
Living and active, it cuts to the heart,
With truth to reveal and life to impart.
Tis the week after Christmas and Jesus still saves,
His death defeats sin and his life conquers graves.
His arms remain open to all who believe,
Repent of their sin and their savior receive.
Tis the week after Christmas and Christ is still King.
Wise men still seek him and angels still sing.
So rejoice in your savior, lift up your song,
And worship King Jesus all the year long!
",Micah Carpenter,"Bemidji, MN",1/1/2017,
"In the TV special, “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” we hear Linus
read Luke 2:8-14. He ends by saying, “That’s what Christmas is all
about Charlie Brown.” Charles M. Schulz did a great job back in 1965.
Many of us weren’t even born yet, but we’ve come to appreciate Linus
reciting the Christmas Story and keeping us on track with the true
meaning of Christmas. Matthew 1:23 teaches us that, “The virgin will
conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” (which means “God WITH
us”).”
1Today I’d like to tell you a story. It’s a story about a man – a mostly good man, who was
kind and thoughtful. He wasn’t a Scrooge or a Grinch – he was decent, generous, and upright
in his dealings with other people. But, this man simply didn’t buy the “Christmas story.” He’d
heard it so many times – the story about the God of the universe, supposedly humbling
Himself to be born as a baby, in a manger in Bethlehem. To him, this purported historical
event lined up right next to the toy Nutcracker coming to life in that famous ballet. To his adult
sensibilities, it seemed like just a silly story. Despite his wife’s sincere faith and devotion to
God, he remained a skeptic; unconvinced and unmoved.
He got to thinking though: “Whose idea was Christmas anyways?” ""Who came up with this
ludicrous idea that an utterly transcendent God would reduce Himself to mundane humanity?
…And why? Why would the divine essence of the one true God embody Himself in the fragile
state of a human infant?"" Please…give me a break! It made no sense!
He remembered back to his Sunday School teacher as a kid. Mrs. Crosby was so kind and
patient. She was the first one who taught him about Jesus having the name “Immanuel,” and
that it meant “God with us.” The idea of the incarnation was just fine for him as a kid. But now,
as an adult, it was clearly a crazy concept. It didn’t make any sense to his rational mind. He
was just not willing to abandon his intellectual honesty.
He could not pretend that he believed what he had learned as a child.
And so, each Christmas Eve, when his wife would once again ask him to come to church
with her, he flat out told her “no thank you.” “Honey, I know it makes you sad but I’m not
coming to church with you and the kids for the Christmas Eve service. I’d feel like a hypocrite.
I’d much rather just stay at home but I‘ll wait up for you guys.” So he stayed at home alone
while his family went to the Christmas Eve service at the church just a little ways down the
street.
He watched out the window as his family drove away in the minivan. Snow was just
beginning to fall in big flakes and the scene was something right out of a postcard – a real
Hallmark moment. He watched for a few more minutes as the snow turned heavier and the wind began to gust – a storm was coming in. He went back to his chair by the warm, crackling
fire and began to read an old Louis L’Amour novel. And then, all of a sudden… wham! – a
loud thud against his window. And then, two more, wham - wham. He thought to himself,
“probably just some of the neighborhood kids throwing snowballs.” But, when he went to his
front door to check it out, he found instead… a flock of birds, huddled miserably in the snow.
They’d been caught in the storm. Driven by the wind and their own fear they were flying
themselves right into the picture window, trying to gain shelter from the storm. He’d always
loved all the various specie s of beautiful little songbirds that would
come and sit at his feeders.
Well, he couldn’t just let the poor creatures lie there and freeze to
death so he grabbed his coat and slipped on his boots and ran
through the snow and cold to his barn. It would provide a warm
shelter if he could just get the birds to go in. So he threw the doors
open wide and turned on a light but… the birds did not come in; they would not come in. He
thought that perhaps food might entice them in so he ran back into the house and got a loaf of
bread. Carefully he walked his way backwards from the birds toward the big open doors of the
barn, crumbling piece after piece of the bread, making a trail to the safe, warm barn. But, to
his disappointment, the birds ignored the breadcrumbs and continued to flap around
helplessly.
He tried circling around them in an effort to herd them toward the barn but they kept
turning in every direction… except, of course, in the direction of the barn. He tried to catch
them with his gloved hands so he could gently carry them to the barn one by one but they
scattered in all directions. And then, he tried something desperate, even silly. He looked
around to make sure that no one was watching and then he began to flap his arms, like a bird.
He thought maybe that would make them think he was just a big bird trying to help them.
Well, obviously that didn’t work either!
Eventually he realized… they were just too afraid of him. He thought to himself, “To them, I
am a HUGE and terrifying creature. If only I could think of some way to let them know that
they can trust me. I’m not trying to hurt them; I’m trying to help them. But how can I convince
them? I’m 100 times their size, I don’t speak their language, and they have no reason to trust
me. They’ll never be able to understand what I’m trying to do for them. They can’t be enticed
or lead or herded. I’m not sure what else that I can do…”
“If only I could be a bird and be WITH them. Not just pretend to be LIKE them but to
actually be among them AS a fellow bird. Then I could speak to them in their own language.
Then, they might trust me and understand that I’m just trying to help. I could tell them not to
be afraid. I could show them the way to safety and life. I could lead them to the shelter of the
warm barn. If only I were one of them. But I would have to become one of them in order to
genuinely be WITH them. I would have to become a bird, so they could see and hear and
understand my message. Boy, it sure sounds silly… it sounds crazy… but it would work!”
That’s exactly what I would need to do…
At that moment the sound of church bells broke through the noise of the storm. The sound
of Christmas carols reached the man’s ears. He listened to the bells ringing in the glad tidings
of Christmas – Christ is born, Peace on earth and good will to men. Then the man sank to his 
knees in the snow and he prayed to the God who had loved him enough to become a human
being in order that he might understand the way to safety and life.
The point of this modern parable is very simple. “Whose idea was Christmas anyway?”
Well, it was God’s idea. God, in His mercy and kindness, doesn’t want to frighten us but
rather to invite us to safety. Matthew 1:23 makes a lot of sense in this context, “The virgin will
conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel” (which means “God WITH
us”).” Jesus had to become one of us so that we could see and hear and understand His
message – the Good News. We can find shelter in Him. We can have a meaningful and
abundant life, if only we will trust Him, turn to Him, and follow Him.
It becomes fairly clear why the divine essence of the one true God chose to embody
Himself in the fragile state of a human infant. This ludicrous idea that an utterly transcendent
God would reduce Himself to mundane humanity is precisely what the Bible teaches us.
Colossians 2:9 tells us, “For in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form.”
Transcendence and immanence are not mutually exclusive. They may seem like an
oxymoron but in Jesus this reality is explained and illustrated so vividly for us.
 John 1:14 tells us, “The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have
seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and
truth.” This phrase “made his dwelling” can be translated “set up his tent.” Jesus set up His
tent on planet earth so that we could get to know Him. He made this earth his temporary
residence. The Message2
translation says it this way: “The Word became flesh and blood,
and moved into the neighborhood.” The imagery of Jesus setting up His tent causes us to
glance back at the OT Tabernacle. The tabernacle was a tent about the size of our Sanctuary
platform 15’ wide x 45’ long and 15’ high. It was surrounded by a courtyard area not too much
different than the size of our church sanctuary 75’ x 150’.3 OT Israel would set up this
Tabernacle as they traveled through the desert wilderness. The 12 tribes would set up their
camp all around it.
There are over 125 times in the OT where the Tabernacle is
called the “tent of meeting.”4
It was a place for communication with
God and revelation from Him.5 The OT Tabernacle was a
significant visual demonstration of God dwelling among His people,
i.e. “God WITH us.” The Tent of Meeting was also a foreshadowing
of Jesus, the Messiah who would come and dwell among us.
We learn even more about WHY Jesus dwelt among us in Romans 5:19. It sets up a
contrast between the man Adam and the man Jesus: “For just as through the disobedience of
the one man [Adam] the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one
man [Jesus] the many will be made righteous.”
“It had to happen this way. Only in the complete identification with our flesh could Christ be
the second Adam, the perfect man that Adam was not. Adam sinned and died as a man; only
as a man could Jesus do what Adam failed to do and be the mediator between God and man. Why? Because only flesh can die.”6 Hebrews 2:14 & 17 explain it this way, “Since the children
have flesh and blood, he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might break the
power of him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil… 17 For this reason he had to
be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and
faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the
people.”
God the Father wanted to send us a clear message of His love on that very first Christmas.
Therefore, He sent Jesus into humanity to be Immanuel who is “God WITH us.” May we now
have the power to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of God expressed
through Jesus Christ. Amen. And Merry Christmas!

"Our song just ended with the words, “Worship Christ, the newborn King!” There is a thrill of hope
in each person who understands that Jesus is the King of ALL kings. And He alone is worthy of our
worship. It is a thrill of hope to know and worship Jesus Christ! But there are times in all of our lives
when it’s difficult to worship. Sometimes we can’t see hope, we can’t feel it, we just can’t seem to
grasp on to it. And so, hope does not thrill our souls they way it ought to or perhaps the way it used to
or the way it seems to for other people. There are times in life when it’s difficult to hold on to hope.
For some of us, we can think back to a time in our past when we were losing hope and we felt
deep despair and we wondered how we would ever make it through. But somehow, by God’s grace
we did make it through. For others, we are losing hope right now, even today. We are struggling on
this very morning to hang on. The circumstances of life in the real world are pulling us down into a
muddy pit. And our hope seems to be dangling by a thread. For still others, we understand there are
no guarantees for our future even if things have been going pretty well lately. We know that there may
very well be something waiting down the road in 2017, around the next bend, that could cause us to
struggle to maintain a hopeful outlook. Life could change quickly.
Certain events in the world around us make things seem hopeless at times. The war and Syrian
refugee crisis is Aleppo is incredibly discouraging. Human trafficking continues to be an unimaginable
evil in our world, around the globe and locally. Acts of violence and murder, school shootings, and the
like continue to pop up on the radar all over our nation. Hope begins to feel very, VERY far away.
In our personal lives, this world can cause us to grow weary through relationship struggles,
financial struggles, challenges at school or work, or health problems for us or someone we love. Any
number of life circumstances can pile up and create a weariness in each one of us. And it’s not just
physical weariness. But rather the kind of weariness that can’t be remedied by a good night’s sleep or
an extra energy drink. It’s a weariness that saps our energy, our joy, and ultimately, our hope.
It’s a weariness in our souls.
If this is how you are feeling this morning, I bring good tidings of great hope today. In Mt. 11:28-30
Jesus offers us these words of hope and comfort: “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened,
and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in
heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”
Beginning at that very first Christmas, Jesus came to this earth, humbly and gently, as an infant in
a manger, to offer us rest for our souls and genuine, lasting hope for our lives. Hope that overcomes
any situation in life. It’s been said, “There are no hopeless situations; there are only people who have
grown hopeless about them.”1 One of the songs our choir will sing this morning is, “O Holy Night.”
One line from this song talks about, “a thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices.” There is reason for
hope in our modern day world. There is reason to rejoice!
Let me give you just two examples. Just last week, I received a ministry update from an old friend
of mine named Dustin Kelm. He and his wife Katie have a global unicycling ministry. They travel all
over the world and he performs amazing stunts on his unicycle. And they also share the Good News
about the hope that is found in Jesus. This past year they traveled to places like Kenya, Albania,
Egypt, and even Turkey. Yes, that’s right, Turkey. Turkey sits right next to Syria. This is where many of the refugess are fleeing. This is also where many incredible ministries and relief efforts are setting
up; many of them in Jesus’ name.
Dustin writes: “Our tour was one month after the coup attempt but we still presented the Gospel
openly to thousands who were very receptive. The few who caused disturbances by acting harshly
made others even more curious about our message, giving us new opportunities to tell the Good
News.” I love it! Hope is being offered in places that may SEEM hopeless to us.
Here is a 2nd example. One of our Global Partners, Kathy Austvold, is bringing hope in Jesus
name to India. She serves in a place where poverty and human trafficking are running rampant. Just
this week, I received an email from her. She writes: Did you know when children have hope,
wonderful things happen! …When children have hope their parents also have hope… Outside of
Kolkata, close to the city dump, there is a village where hope is being given to entire families. Tumpa,
a wife and mother, is attending sewing classes and learning skills that enable her to earn a small
amount of money for her family. Her interest goes beyond acquiring sewing skills to also learning
about Jesus as she gathers weekly with other women for prayer, worship and Bible study.
It was the result of the ministry to women that the GlobalFingerprints program was born in this
very needy village. Tumpa’s 9-year-old son, Dev, is one of 85 children who are sponsored through
Global Fingerprints…Now the children’s fees are paid so that they can attend school…. On Saturdays
around 200 children and teens are attending Bible Clubs! Children receive nutritional snacks, have
regular doctor checkups and also receive home visits from the children’s workers. Life is very difficult
for Tumpa and Dev, but they are finding the hope and love of Jesus.
Hope in Jesus is an awesome, powerful force in our world today! I shared 2 examples of hope that
is found through Christ. Allow me to share just one more. It’s sitting right here in front of me. It’s the
Christ-followers who are in this room or reading this transcript. Here is a picture of our bell tower that
sits right outside the front of our church. It was dedicated to our church back in 1992 by
Ivan/Esther Lauderbaugh and Ivan/Elaine Lauderbaugh. I wanted to open up the side
door of our sanctuary to let the sound of the bell in this morning but I didn’t think the
people sitting in Section #1 would appreciate that. I’m also a little concerned it could
damage the bell in the severe cold we are experiencing today. But our church has no
shortage of bells! So, I asked Judy Emery to help me out. As she rigns this large handbell,
think about this: It seems to me that the point of a bell is to ring forth loud and clear. To
send out a message. The bell outside our building is there to ring hope! And the idea of
the cross on top is to point people in our community to not just any hope but the genuine hope that is
found in Christ.
So may our church, the Evangelical Free Church of Bemidji, not just be a place where we meet as
a church. May this not just be a building on which we hang our bell. But may our message also ring
forth from this place as we endeavor to BE the church in our community, for our community, and to
our community and the world.
The purpose of that first Christmas was to bring hope physically into the world. There are many
people in our Bemidji community who are now living, “without hope and without God.”2 May our hope
in Christ compel us this Christmas, to be a grace community that shares the thrill of hope with others.
May our witness ring out clearly in this advent season! May we share this hope with our friends and
neighbors. And, with all our relatives over the Christmas holiday, even the ones we are kind of glad
we only see once a year. They need to find hope in Jesus as well. “Christ’s birth is still the ultimate hope for a broken world.”3 Our Cantata this morning is called “A Thrill of Hope.” Hope in Jesus is
something thrilling indeed!
Praise God for His Gift of Love demonstrated in the birth of Jesus Christ. Praise Him for the
lasting peace that He offers us through the death and resurrection of his son, Jesus. Let’s choose to
keep singing songs of joy to Him from our hearts as we experience the thrill of hope in our encounters
with Him. And may God help our witness to ring forth this Christmas season!

"Introduction
One day as Jesus and His disciples were together he asked a question, “Whom do people say that I am”?
This is still in important question today. Religions all over the world have answers to this question, both
Christian and non-Christian alike. Interestingly we can find insight to this question by looking at the gifts
presented by the Magi to the Christ Child at Bethlehem. The Bible itself is silent about the gifts, why they were
chosen or that there is any connection to the life and mission of Christ. However, upon a closer look both
historically and from scripture one can begin to make a connection of the gifts to the life of Christ: who He is
and the purpose of His coming.
Before we look at the gifts let take just a minute or so to review the Magi. The story of their journey has
had much embellishment over the years since the journey was made 2000 years ago. We do know they came
from a faraway land, likely the area of Iraq today. We learn this from where they said they saw the star, the
sign of Jesus’ birth. These men were educated men and likely had some status in the county from which they
came. Over the years, the titles of “Wise Men” and “King” have been added and their number was three.
Nothing points to these titles or that there were three in number. There were three gifts so three Magi so the
reasoning goes.
They likely knew of the prophesy of the Jewish redeemer from the events that had happened 600 years
earlier. At that time, King Nebuchadnezzar attacked and destroyed Judah and its kingdom. The army spoiled
the Temple and took several captives back to Babylon. These captives had with them the old testament
scriptures given up to that time. One was particularly important, what we know today as the book of Isaiah. In
Isaiah, we find the prophesy that a virgin would give birth to a child and the child would be called Emmanuelle
– that is God with us, a redeemer. Some years later some of the Jews returned and some stayed in Babylon.
The Jewish culture, scripture and prophecies would have remained in the land and become known to the
people of that land which was now in the Persian empire.
Interesting thing about the Babylonians, they studied the stars in the night sky. They demarked the sky by
the regions in which the stars are found and gave them names, and ascribed earthly significance to them.
They paid attention to the “wanders” (planets) which passed through the regions of the sky (we call these
constellations today). Eventually these regions would be assigned months of the year and have significance to
the person from when the person’s birthday occurred. These beliefs are still with us today in the form of the
Horoscope. We are not told much about the star which of itself is an interesting story in history, but we will not
spend any time here today.
At the appearance of the star their preparations and journey began and their travels took them to
Jerusalem – the capital city of the Jews. Where else would the “King of the Jews” be found? On arrival, they
came to ruling leader - Herod the Great. Their question, “Where is He who has been born King of the Jews”
troubled both the city and Herod. Herod was not a Jew. In fact, he had been appointed ruler of the region by
the Roman Senate some 37 years earlier. The question itself could have been viewed as challenge to his
position and it was not good thing to challenge this ruthless ruler. Given the location of the foretold town where
this King of the Jews would be born they traveled to Bethlehem and found Jesus. No longer in a stable Jesus
could have been a newborn or perhaps a child of 2 years or less old. There they worshiped Jesus and
presented Him their gifts of Gold, Frankincense, and Myrrh.
You can read the rest of the story in Chapter 2 of Matthew.
Let us look at these gifts.
A few weeks ago, Pastor Jerry shared the fragrance of Frankincense, today you can sample the fragrance of
Myrrh and we’ll pass that out now so everyone will have a chance to enjoy the fragrance before the end of the
service
The First Gift is Gold
Gold has always been valued by man. It is a rare substance, beautiful in appearance and has been used
to craft works of art and function in history. It also has been used to represent deity’s and idols. Some
interesting facts about gold. A single ounce can be drawn into a wire 50 miles long. Ancient Egypt could
pound gold leaf so thin it would take over 300,000 sheets to stack up to one inch. For those 55 or older you
may recall the Apollo moon landings and appearance of the astronaut’s helmets. They had a very thin layer of
gold on the visor as a shield for the solar radiation present on the moon but blocked out on earth by the 
atmosphere. Of all the gold ever minded and if formed into a cube that cube would only be 67 feet on one
side.
Gold, Kings, and Authority all seem to go together historically. Consider King Tut’s burial mask, the
appearance today still brings amazement and appreciation for the craftsmanship and use of gold. Here are
two Biblical references that also show King’s use of gold:
2 Chronicles: 9:20 – All King Solomon’s goblets were gold, and all the house hold articles in the Palace of
the Forest were pure gold. Nothing was made of silver, because silver was considered of little value in
Solomon’s day.
Daniel 3:1 - King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold, sixty cubits high and six cubits wide, and set it
up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon.
Both verses reference the King’s use of gold. While visiting the Ft. Benning Military Museum a few years
ago I saw a display case with some of the spoils of world war 2, among them a golden baton. The baton was a
symbol of authority to whom it belonged the appearance was quite amazing to look at. As one followed the
lines of the baton they led to the top where there was a swastika – the symbol of Nazi power. Quite mix beauty
and contrast with a dark time in history. Both good and evil have valued gold over time as status for: power,
wealth and authority.
Gold is also associated with the Tabernacle and later the Temple that Solomon built. There are over 100
references to the use of gold as instructed by God to Moses. Let’s consider the Ark:
Exodus 25: 10 -12 - Have them make an ark … Overlay it with pure gold, both inside and out, and make a gold
molding around it. Cast four gold rings for it and fasten them to its four feet, with two rings on one side and two
on the other. Then make poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
Later when the Tabernacle was replaced by the Temple which Solomon built it is described as this: Solomon
covered the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner
sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold. So he overlaid with gold the whole interior with gold. He also overlaid
with gold the alter that belonged to the inner sanctuary.
Heaven itself is replete with gold, even the streets. When we think of earthly Kings one symbol stands out
– what is it? - a golden crown. Listen to this final reference regarding Christ form Revelation
Revelation 17:14 - Then they will wage war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will triumph over them,
because he is Lord of lords and King of kings.
There is no greater power … no greater authority - than our King Jesus.
The first gift of Gold points to Christ’s position as King of Kings
Frankincense
The second gift presented to the new born King was the gift of incense or frankincense. Frankincense is
the dried sap or resin from the Boswella tree. This tree grows on the Arabia peninsula and the horn of Africa.
The trade of frankincense goes back at least 5000 years and has quite a history in this region. To produce the
resin the tree is wounded by a cut and sap runs out and forms a resin like substance which is collected, dried,
is ready for use. Traditionally the resin is placed over burning charcoal and begins to smoke as it contacts the
hot coals and releases the fragrant odor it is famous for. It can also be made in to essential oils which is
popular in recent years. It was and still is quite valuable. Raw high quality Frankincense sells for about $26
dollars an ounce today and the essential oils can be quite expensive for a small bottle. I found one estimate
that at the time of Christ’s birth frankincense would have been about $31 dollars an ounce. We are not told
just how much was given by the Magi.
Like gold, frankincense is often mentioned in the bible and associated with spiritual significance. Again, we
find reference in Exodus:
Exodus 30:7 - Aaron must burn fragrant incense on the alter every morning when he tends the lamps. He
must burn incense again when he lights the lamps at twilight so incense will burn regularly before the Lord.
Recall that Aaron was the first high priest in Israel. The role of priestly duties was to serve as a mediator
between God and Man. The High Priest had all the regular duties of the priesthood but also had duties of the
oversite of the tabernacle or temple and its place in Israel’s national identity and relation to God. One other
very important duty was in the performance of the High Priests office, a special service to conduct the annual
day of Atonement ceremony. In doing the work of this duty as prescribed by God the High Priest had to enter
the Holy of Holy’s once per year with the blood of a sacrificed bull and was required to burn incense. This
ceremony first made atonement for the sins of the High Priest, the other Priests, and finally the entire nation of 
Israel. It was a very solemn time for the people who were dependent of the High Priest to perform this duty of
seeking atonement as prescribed by God.
God gave Moses specific instructions for making a special kind of incense to be used:
Exodus 30:34 - Take fragrant spices, gum resin, onycha, and galbanum and pure frankincense all in equal
amounts.
This was an exclusive formula and only the priests of Israel could make and use as it was to be
considered, “most holy to you”.
Further use of incense by the priests is noted in Leviticus 2:
When anyone brings a grain offering to the Lord, their offering is to be of the finest flour. They are to pour
olive oil on it and take it to Aaron’s sons the priests. The priest shall take a hand full of the flour and oil,
together with all the incense, and burn this as a memorial portion of the alter, a food offering, an aroma
pleasing to the Lord.
The smoke of the burning incense was symbolic of prayer rising to the Lord. David prays in Psalm 141 that
his prayers would be set before God like incense. In Revelation, we find reference to this when the Lamb goes
forward to take the Scroll from Him who sat on the throne:
Revelation 5:8 - And when he had taken it, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before
the Lamb. Each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of
God’s people.
The second gift of Frankincense points to Christ’s role as High Priest serving as mediator between
God and Man.
2 Timothy says, “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ
Jesus.”
Jesus now occupies this role as High Priest --- mediator between Us and God – He Serves as the last and final
occupant of this office, Hebrews says this:
Therefore, since we have a great High Priest who has ascended into heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us
hold firmly to the faith we profess. For we do not have a high priest who us unable to empathize with our
weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are – yet he did not sin. Let us
then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us
in our time of need.
Myrrh
The final gift given is Myrrh. Myrrh is also dried sap only from the Commiphora tree and it grows in the
nearly the same location as the Boswella tree. Myrrh is also gathered by making cuts in the tree and letting the
sap run out and dry. Myrrh is also placed over burning coals to release the fragrance or can be made into oils.
Like Frankincense the trade in myrrh is ancient and we find it first mentioned in the bible as one of the spices
the caravan of traders were carrying to whom Joseph was sold to by his brothers.
Myrrh is an ingredient used in making a holy anointing oil as directed by God to Moses:
Ex. 30: 22-24: Then the Lord said to Moses, Take the following fine spices: 500 shekels of Liquid myrrh, half
as much of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant calamus and 500 shekels of cassia and a hin of olive
oil. Make these into a sacred anointing oil …
This oil was use to consecrate or purify the tabernacle and the things of it. It was sprinkled on the items such
as the ark, alters, priestly garments, and even the priest themselves. Myrrh was used in medicine and
cosmetics of the day, consider the beauty treatment that Esther received before becoming Queen:
Esther 2:12: … she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women, six
months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics.
The King James Bible and some other translations use the term “purification treatments” in place of beauty
treatments. I would ask that you keep that in mind. Myrrh was apparently the more expensive of the two
spices, one reference gave a value estimated at $250 per ounce at the time of Christ. Again, we are not told
how much myrrh was given.
Myrrh also takes on another role historically and biblically as an embalming spice for the dead. The
Egyptians used myrrh in the mummification process and it is noted in the Gospel of John in the burial of Christ,
we read:
John 19: 38 – 42: Later, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for the body of Jesus … with Pilate’s
permission, he came and took the body away. He was accompanied by Nicodemus, the man who earlier had
visited Jesus at night. Nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about 75 pounds. Taking Jesus 
body, the two of them wrapped it, with the spices, in strips of linen. This was in accordance with the Jewish
burial customs.
In our Christian faith we recognize the that the price and penalty of sin is death. We also recognize Christ
came to earth to pay that price for us by His death on the cross, a substitution so to speak. Romans uses
another word for this substitutionary action: Propitiating. The sense I have of this word is that which satisfies
or appeases a debt or anger. This gift of Myrrh, to me is the most significant and most precious of the
representation of Christ.
The third gift of Myrrh points to Christ’s atoning sacrifice paying the price for our sin by His death
on the cross.
Christ his self says it this way:
Matthew 20:28“the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many”.
Strange gift for a newborn - eh? One that signifies His death …
When a child I never could get the name of Good Friday. How could day that signifies Christ’s death be
good? Only later did I come to understand the goodness of this day - it was the day that bought our salvation!
For us it is the greatest day ever! Salvation comes to man under no other name than Jesus, and for those who
believe and put their trust in Him - forgiveness and purification from sin is given.
A review
A quick review as we close. We are not told that the Magi knew of the significance of their gifts nor does
the bible prescribe for us that significance. However I hope you can see, at least to a degree, these
connections as we study Gods word and the life and words of Jesus. This brings us back to the question that
Christ asked as we began this talk, “whom do men say that I am”? The three gifts point to the description of:
Gold - “King”
Frankincense - High Priest”
Myrrh – “Savior”
If someone asked you whom do you believe Christ is this Christmas season what answer would you give?
High Priest and even King are not likely the first thoughts that come to mind, but Savior - that may be a more
common answer for those who know him. And Savior holds its special meaning in another season we
celebrate – the Risen Christ at Easter.
One last thought. After the Magi left that night Joseph was told in a dream to “take the child and his mother
and escape to Egypt”. Not many of us could immediately load up the car and head down to a foreign city to
live without some means of support. Yet apparently, that is exactly what happened – well maybe camel
instead of car. The three gifts given by the Magi were of the highest value of that day and could have easily
provided the financial support needed for the journey and time spent there. Doesn’t that sound like God to
you? Making provision for us as we go about His business?

A few Christmas’ ago Deb and I were given a gift that appeared to be representative our or family name
(Williams) - this large wooden “W”. But it too had spiritual significance: on the W is inscribed these words,
“Wise men still seek Him”. May that be said of all of us here today.",John F. Williams,"Bemidji, MN",12/11/2016,
"My family and I enjoy watching the show Shark Tank. It’s a show where
young entrepreneurs gather to pitch their ideas to wealthy investors. Have you
seen this show? It’s so intriguing to see the new inventions and ideas for starting
up new products and new companies. But some of the sharks, especially one
who calls himself “Mr. Wonderful,” seems to be ultimately consumed with just
one passion: MONEY. He already has millions but it’s clear that he wants millions more. He has more
than enough but it’s just not enough!
1 Timothy 6:10 begins, “For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil...” Not the root of ALL
evil but a root of all KINDS of evil. Money, in and of itself, is not evil but loving it leads to evil. Rich
people can fall in love with money but, then again, so can poor people and those who are in the
middle class can end up loving money. So, it’s important for each Christ-follower to ask herself and to
ask himself: Am I in love with money? Well, I’m glad that you asked. Here’s a little self-test: You may
be in love with money if…2
1) …You’re more focused on how much money you can make at your job rather than on how well
you are doing your work or how well you are glorifying God with your work.
2) …Enough is never enough; if you never seem to find yourself in a place where you are satisfied
with how much money you make or how many possessions you have.
3) …You flaunt your possessions, finding pleasure in showing off what you wear, what you drive, or
where you live.
4) …You resent giving money to others; if it pains you to give, even when it’s a worthy cause,
because sharing is distasteful to you.
5) …You sin to get more money: by lying on your taxes, cheating on your expense accounts, stealing
from the cash drawer, or compromising your convictions in some way so that you can make more
money.
The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. It causes problems in our personal lives, our
marriages, and our families. It can cause trouble in churches, in our workplace, and in the community.
The problem is not the money. We need money to survive and to thrive and to enjoy the good things
God has provided for us.
3 The problem comes in our attitude toward money.
1 Timothy 6:9-10 says, “Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many
foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a
root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced
themselves with many griefs.”
Christ-followers who love money with all of their heart, soul, mind, and strength are in terrible
danger; the worst possible danger imaginable. And here’s what it is: The love of money puts us in
danger of wandering from our faith. This phrase ""eager for money"" is a causative participle.
This means that the phrase ""eager for money"" is the cause of ""wandered from the faith."" Can you picture that? You and I are walking in our Christian faith along the path that God has laid
out for us. As we look to the side we see opportunities for money and possessions. We think to
ourselves, “I going to stay on the path but it won't hurt to reach out to the edges a little and grab a few
extras.” We tell ourselves we'll just slow down a little, turn to the side, and lean out there a bit. But
what happens is that we end up coming to a complete halt in our Christian life and service. We end
up walking right off the path. We didn't intend to, but that's where we end up, off the narrow road,
headed down the broad road that leads to destruction.5 We got distracted by our desire for more
money and more possessions.
V. 10 tells us that this has already happened to some of the believers in Timothy’s church. It’s in
the past tense: they “have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs.” So,
beware! This could happen to you too and to me! The love of money puts us in danger of wandering
from our faith. In vv. 11-12, Paul urges Timothy to flee from all this and to pursue godliness, to fight
the good fight of faith.
1 Timothy 6:7-8 jerks us back to a proper perspective: “For we brought nothing into the world, and
we can take nothing out of it. But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that.” Godliness
with Contentment teaches us to live in view of eternity. Living in view of eternity changes how we
regard our temporary possessions. Our OT hero Job knew this. He was a righteous man who had lots
of wealth, but he lost most of it in a single day. In Job 1:21 he says, ""Naked I came from my mother's
womb and naked I will depart."" We can't take anything with us.
Godliness with contentment is satisfied with what it needs and doesn't insist on what it wants. God
understands that we have needs while we live here on earth. The Christian life does not require a
vow of poverty from all of us. So, having food, clothing, and shelter are good things, things that we
need during our earthly lives. The real challenge is being content once our NEEDS have been met.
Learning to be genuinely satisfied when we don’t have all that we WANT.
Let’s join the Apostle Paul in his attitude, Philippians 4:11b-13, “I have learned to be content
whatever the circumstances. 12 I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I
have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry,
whether living in plenty or in want. 13 I can do all this through him who gives me strength.”
Now, this doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t give our kids some Christmas gifts this year. Please
don’t go home and tell them Pastor Jerry said to just be content w/o presents. Don’t throw me under
the bus on this one! But, when you are sitting down together to unwrap your gifts with friends or family
or co-workers, remember the gift of contentment. No matter what’s behind the wrapping paper, find
your ultimate, lasting satisfaction in God.
We are created to be satisfied in God. Only He can truly fulfill and satisfy the deepest longings of
the human heart.
There’s a story about a little boy who liked to play Monopoly with his grandma. Each
time they would play she would always whomp him; she always won. Even if he managed
to get Board Walk and Park Place, both with hotels, grandma somehow eventually
managed to force him to mortgage all his properties by the end of the game. Grandma knew how to
win at Monopoly but she also knew the lesson of I Timothy 6:7. After the game comes to an end, all of
the houses and hotels and deeds of ownership will go back in the box. When the dice are rolled for
the last time and all the money is added up, it all goes back in the box. It doesn't last. One day I will die. However much or little I possess will be passed along to someone else. And
when they die, it will get passed along again. Christ-followers who understand godliness with
contentment recognize that we are simply temporary stewards of God’s resources. God provides us a
certain amount to live on during our few years on this earth. But, by the way I act, the way we act
sometimes, you’d think we we're taking it with us. Or, to watch some of us Christians, you'd think that
we weren't very sure about the promises of heaven. It's as if we are setting up our lives here on earth
to be really good just in case heaven doesn’t pan out in the end.
The fact is, often we aren't content even when all of our NEEDS are fully met. Consumerism
makes contentment difficult. It teaches us that more things will make us more happy. We begin to
define being content as that one day when we will finally have all the money and things we want.6
Then we will be content. Of course, that day never comes because we no sooner get all the things on
our want list and we realize there were a few things we forgot to put on the list. Our sinful human
nature always leaves us wanting more. We never experience that illusive ""enough."" Unless… we
learn to live in view of eternity and allow God to bless us with the gift of contentment.
1 Timothy 6:6 reveals where true riches lie: “But godliness with contentment is great gain.” It’s
significant to recognize that vv. 5-6 are a play on words contrasting “financial gain” and “great gain.”
Earlier in ch. 6, Paul warns Timothy about teachers in the church who think that godliness is a means
to financial gain.7
It’s a warning that even teachers and pastors in the church can be robbed of the
truth. The distinguishing factor between “financial gain” and “great gain” is CONTENTMENT.
Contentment is even better than financial gain; better than 1-day 10% jump in the Dow Jones
Industrial Av. It’s better than a 25% increase in our annual financial portfolio.
It’s stunning to learn about how many lottery winners, professional athletes, and Hollywood stars
end up financially broke just a few years after acquiring their wealth. Historically, rich financial gain
has plunged many people into ruin and destruction. None the less, many of us still want to get rich. I
try not to delude myself, as a pastor, into thinking that somehow I can weild the power of wealth
better than others have done. Wow, can you imagine how awesome it would be for a pastor to
receive a multi-million dollar inheritance? Just think of what all those millions of dollars would do for
the ministry of a local church. Yeah, just think about it. Money is not the answer to all the world’s
problems. We would be wrong to let ourselves start thinking this way. We can’t buy our way OUT of
sin. In fact, today’s text says much the opposite. We seem to buy our way IN to sin!
Greed is something we talked about briefly back in Ephesians 5:3:
“But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of
greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people.” Greed is improper for Christ-followers. It
reveals a belief in Hedonism; that pursuing sensual pleasure and self-indulgence is the highest good
and the proper goal of human life. A lifestyle of greed is exactly opposite of contentment.
Contentment:8
is the state of being satisfied with our circumstances.9
If things are tight right now, but
we have all that we really need, it’s good to be content. If things are relatively comfortable, and we
have a little more than we need, it’s good to be content. If we are blessed with lots and lots of extra,
it’s good to be content. And, with any extra that we may have, rather than spending it on ourselves, 1
Timothy 6:18 commands us, “to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share.”
Godliness with contentment can be enjoyed by rich people and also by those who are poor, as well
as those of us living in the middle class. It’s not about the amount of money we have, it’s about our attitude toward money. Therefore, all of us Christ-followers, need to intentionally and strategically
commit ourselves to a different attitude; an attitude of contentment regardless of how rich or poor we
may be or may become in the future. “A contented godliness produces a gain that money can’t buy.”10
If we can learn to be genuinely content with what God has given us, we have acquired GREAT GAIN.
But how can we achieve contentment? It can be very elusive. How do we get to that place of
contentment and then stay there?
11 I have 5 suggestions:
 1. Ask God to change our heart.
 2. Acknowledge that God owns everything.
 3. Cultivate a thankful heart.
 4. Spend less than we make.
 5. Give sacrificially to others.
V. 10 taught us that “The love of money is a root.” It may be time for some of us to do some
weeding; to pull up some roots. We may need to pay back anyone we have cheated out of paying. It
might be time to reprioritize your personal budget to reflect godly contentment rather than your own
foolish and harmful desires. Rather than being eager for money become eager to share! You may
need to give some money away; discipline yourself with the habit of generosity. My mind flashes to
the Scrooge blessing Tiny Tim or to the Grinch returning all the children’s toys. Only, to be honest, I’m
not sure that it’s always joyful and fun. Giving up greed and learning to be generous may very well be
difficult for some of us. You may find it relatively painful and challenging. But, you can be sure of this:
God’s Word teaches us that Godliness with CONTENTMENT is great gain. It’s the best gift you could
GET this Christmas. It’s a gift that comes from God. Why not ask Him for it right now?
",Jerry Johnson,"Bemidji, MN",12/4/2016,
"There’s a Christian camp near Upsala, MN called Camp Lebanon. Their
motto is that they are “A meeting place with God.” That’s a great motto! This
church building that we are sitting in is just a building; it’s just a tool for
ministry. And yet, it’s also so much more, because it’s a place that was built
and designed and dedicated to be a meeting place with God. That’s why it
sits here on the corner of Carr Lake Rd and Washington Av. this morning.
There are times in all of our lives when it is very valuable to look back and learn from
our past. There are also times in our lives when there is great value in looking forward
and planning for what’s next. Today, in our church’s life, we are going to be doing both
of those things. In my quiet time this week, I was captured by 1 Timothy 1:18. Paul
writes, “Timothy, my son, I am giving you this command in keeping with the prophecies
once made about you, so that by recalling them you may fight the battle well.” Paul
knew that simply reminding Timothy of his past calling to ministry, would revitalize his
current mission for the gospel.
One of the ways that our church can be reminded of our past calling to ministry is to
consider some of the various ministry spaces where we have worshipped together and
grown spiritually over the years. Our physical gathering space as a church body goes
back at least 92 years, as far as 1924. That’s when we gathered at
the old Carr Lake School. It’s now referred to as the Old School
House. It’s located about ¾ of a mile west of here on Carr Lake
Road. The closest thing that I could find to an old picture of that
building is from a Carr Lake VBS.1
I’m guessing that there is no one
here today, who gathered in this particular worship space? But, a
generation of Christ-followers before us, did. Those who’ve gone
before us were faithful back in those days. That can inspire us to
want to be faithful now, so that we can continue this ongoing heritage of faith for those
who follow us.
In 1952, our 1st official church building was completed. It was called
the Carr Lake Bible Chapel. I found an old picture of it. Perhaps there
is someone here this morning who has been in this worship space? I
invite you to please stand if you were. This building was converted into
a house. It’s located in the same spot: 825 Chapel Lane. It’s now the
home of Ivan and Elaine Lauderbaugh.
In 1976, we constructed our 2
nd church building. It used to be located at
the present site of The Gym Bin, which is only about ½ mile north of where
we are today but it’s on the east side of Washington Av. That building was
then moved to the north end of the property and placed over a new basement
foundation.2 There must be a few people here today who worshipped in that
space? In 1989 we constructed our “New Building” on the corner of Carr Lake Rd. &
Washington Av. That is where our church is currently. This
building met our needs for a long time. You may remember
the inside looking a little different. Those blue chairs you see
are actually sitting in our Youth Room right now. And that
back wall behind section 3 was originally designed to be
movable, so that we could open it up to the Fellowship Hall
when needed.
Many of us remember a while back when we added on our massive Community Life
Center. Our building used to end at our Fellowship Hall. But we expanded. Any guess
what year that was? We completed the Community Life Center in
2006. In fact, Tuesday, November 29, 2016 marks our 10-year
anniversary of doing ministry in that space. Can you believe it’s
already been 10 years since we completed that project?
Our family came here in 2000, so the Community Life Center was
the first major building project that we were part of. My family will tell
you that I get pretty nostalgic once in a while. I find it helpful to reflect
on where I’ve been; sometimes even visiting old places where I used to live. It’s
fascinating to me, to see how things have changed, and how I’ve changed. How the
trees have grown so tall or, how they’ve been cut down for new developments. Change
is a constant reality; it’s a tide that we can’t hold back. We can only hope to shape and
direct change in the right direction.
It’s intriguing to me how physical spaces can elicit in us some powerful memories. I
think of decisions that I made in those places, life directions that I chose, and ways that
God provided for me in the past. As you reflect on our church’s past, I hope that you’ll
feel inspired to make the most of our ministry opportunities in the future.
In 2011, we completed our Sanctuary expansion project. We actually moved our
Sunday worship services out of this Santuary for a few months and
we met over in the MP Gym. This sanctuary used to have only 4
beams in our ceiling. The center of the platform used to be right by
the electric plug-in between beams 2 and 3. And, the chair in the
front row of Section 4, under beam 5, is right about where the north
exterior wall used to be. This year, 2016, we celebrate our 5-year
anniversary in our newly expanded Sanctuary.
I’d like to ask one last group of people to stand this morning;
anyone who has been attending our church less than 5 years, would you please stand?
That’s awesome. We are so glad that YOU are here! You are the reason we added on
this space. We added on this space so that we could expand ministry; so that there
would be plenty of room for more people to learn about Christ and join us in worshipping
our awesome God.
And now, as we look forward to the future, to the next 5 or 10 years or more of
ministry, let’s maintain our commitment to making sure this place is here for many more
years to come. As long as the Lord gives us the opportunity, let’s make His fame and
reputation known through the ministry that happens in and through this building.
When Solomon had the temple built for the LORD, 2 Chronicles 2:18 tells us that he
assigned 80,000 stonecutters in the hills and 70,000 carriers, with 3,600 foremen to
oversee them. In 2 Chronicles 6:2 Solomon says, “I have built a magnificent temple for
you, a place for you to dwell forever.” The temple was huge, it was magnificient. But
when Solomon prays later on, at the dedication of the temple, he makes it clear that the
magnificience of the structure was never really the key. Solomon humbly prays in 6:18:
“But will God really dwell on earth with humans? The heavens, even the highest
heavens, cannot contain you. How much less this temple I have built!” Just 3 verses later, in 6:21, Solomon recognizes that HEAVEN is God’s dwelling
place: “Hear the supplications of your servant and of your people Israel when they pray
toward this place. Hear from heaven, your dwelling place; and when you hear, forgive.”
He repeats this idea of heaven as God’s dwelling place again in vv. 30, 33, and 39.
Theologically, we understand that our God is omnipresent. He is not confined to any
one space the way we are as humans. And we can worship him and pray to Him at any
time and any place.
And yet, we read in places like 2 Chronicles 5:14 that, “…the glory of the LORD filled
the temple of God.” There was certainly something very special about that physical
building; God showed up there in some pretty amazing ways. 2 Chronicles 6:32-33
explains how people from all over the world were drawn to God’s temple: “As for the
foreigner who does not belong to your people Israel but has come from a distant land
because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm—when
they come and pray toward this temple, 33 then hear from heaven, your dwelling place.
Do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know
your name and fear you, as do your own people Israel, and may know that this house I
have built bears your Name.”
So, the magnificience of the temple structure was never really the key. The key was
that it bore God’s Name; His reputation was uniquely attached to that particular building.
It was a place dedicated to Him and His purposes. People looked toward that place and
gathered there to understand God better, to seek the Lord’s blessing, and to worship
the one true God. That’s what we want for the reputation of our church building and the
ministries here. We want our Bemidji EFC building to be a place that people will look
toward as a place that bear’s God’s Name; a place where people can gather to worship
the Lord and seek after His help and blessing. As a Grace Community, we want this
building to be a lighthouse to our community and world; to be a place for spritual growth
and spiritual answers.
This morning, we can praise God together for the many opportunities He has given
our church throughout our past to be that kind of a place.
And, as we look toward our future mission as a church, we can commit ourselves to
continuing this heritage of faith for a long time to come.
And now, Brothers and Sisters in Christ, in the words of Proverbs 3:5-6, “May we
trust in the Lord with all our hearts and lean not on our own understanding. In all our
ways, may we acknowledge Him and HE will make our paths straight.”

"For a long time, I didn’t realize that I wasn’t very good at saying “thank you.” Oh, it’s not that I
wasn’t saying it often enough or at the appropriate times. But, apparently, I learned to say “thank you”
the wrong way. The problem was in my pronounciation. In fact, I still struggle to remember the
correct phonetics for saying “thank you.”1 You see, linguists will tell you that a proper “th” sound is
more of a dental than a palatal. All that means is that when you say the word “thanks,” your tongue
should touch the bottom edge of your top teeth, a dental. But somehow, I developed the habit of
touching my tongue to the roof of my mouth, my palate, which makes a word into a palatal.
The effect of this is that it makes it sound like I’m saying “dank you” rather than “thank you.” The
irony in this is that “danking” someone may actually be more polite than “thanking” them, because
when you pronuounce a dental, you stick your tongue out a little. Kind of rude right? Just for fun, turn
to the person sitting next to you or look in the mirror and say “thank you.” Watch and see, you actually
stick your tongue out! Well, believe it or not, this does connect with the sermon today. Let’s take
some time to think about, not so much HOW we say thank you, but rather WHY we say thank you.
What is the benefit of thankful words?
Last week’s sermon taught about how “being filled with the Spirit” results in 5 different participles.
One of those resulting participles is in Ephesians 5:20, “always giving thanks to God the Father for
everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” The benefit of always giving thanks is that it
demonstrates, in a tangible way, that we are always being filled with the Spirit. It’s a daily activity for
us to depend on God’s Spirit to equip and empower us for thankful living as a Christ-follower.2
“Always” giving thanks also means that we give thanks “on every occasion’”3 This means in the
good times and the bad; in all circumstances. Let me ask you a question: When is it most difficult to
be thankful; in the good times or the bad times? It may be surprising to some of you that I would
argue that it’s often most difficult to give genuine thanks in the good times. I say this because
oftentimes in our lives, when things are going well, it’s easy to start taking our blessings for granted.
We relax a bit and forget just how blessed we are. We may even begin to feel a bit of entitlement,
“yes, I deserve this good life I’ve worked so hard for.” In a life of abundance, we may even begin to
forget God. Deuteronomy 8:17-18 urges God’s people to remember the Lord even in good times:
“You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for
me.” But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth…”
Therefore, one benefit of always giving thanks is that it helps us keep a proper perspective, even in
the good times. It keeps us from forgetting about God when life is going well; when we may seem to
have a little less need for Him.
Ephesians 5:20 also teaches us the benefit of giving thanks for everything. Some things can be
especially difficult for us to be thankful for. For example, there will be times when our job or schooling
just isn’t going the way we want it to. There are some weeks or even months when we literally have to
drag ourselves out of bed in the morning, force down a few cups of coffee or a few cans of Mountain
Dew, and trudge our way back to work or school. Sometimes our families can see tough times.4 We vowed at our wedding “for better or worse.” But
right now you may be in one of the seasons of worse.
Occassionally our friendships will ebb and flow. There will be some times when our best buds just
aren’t there for us when we need them. They’ll get distracted by a significant other or caught up in
some new hobby or they’ll find a new friend to hang out with instead of us for a while. And there are
other hurts and disappointments in life as well. In the midst of these sad realities, here’s the good
news: as Christ-followers who are being filled with God’s Spirit, we can find a way to give thanks for
EVERYTHING.
Don’t wait for life’s circumstances to improve before you begin to give thanks. A distinctive of the
Christian faith is giving thanks even during times of trouble. Romans 5:3-5 reminds us, “…we also
glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; 4 perseverance,
character; and character, hope. 5 And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been
poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.”
Facing the troubles of this life as opportunities for growth shows that our hope is not in the things of
this life but in the God who gives us life. Struggle is often part of His refining work in our lives. When
we understand, that all of the things we are going through in life are used for God’s purposes, it helps
us to endure rather than give up. It helps us acknowledge that life is not always supposed to be easy.
The Bemidji High School Link Leaders choose a great slogan this year for the back of their t-shirts,
“I’m not telling you it’s going to be easy, I’m telling you it’s going to be worth it.” This is also a good
motto for the Christian life.
Ephesians 5:20 ends by clarifying the benefit of giving thanks to God the Father in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ. It’s very appropriate to give thanks to God on Communion Sunday. Everything
for which we could possibly give thanks is a gift from God.5 And, apart from Jesus, we wouldn’t be in
relationship with God. We would have no access to God the Father or to His Spirit. So, giving thanks
to God is rooted in Jesus.6
One key aspect that we need to recognize from Ephesians 5:20 is that it’s not so much teaching
us about “BEING thankful” as it’s teaching us about “GIVING thanks.”7 This is an action verb. So the
idea here is to express your thanks, to say it out loud!
It is good to feel appreciative but it’s even better to verbalize appreciation!
8 9 There’s no benefit to
the best of Scrabble words if you don’t lay them on the game board! Psalm 107:1-2b
says, “Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; his love endures forever. Let the
redeemed of the LORD tell their story…” The NKJV puts it this way: “Let the redeemed
of the LORD say so!” So, why not do that right now? Find someone today with whom
you can share a word of thanks to God. Share something with a friend of neighbor that will bless and
benefit them today. 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 reminds us to, “Rejoice always, pray continually, give
thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.”",Jerry Johnson,"Bemidji, MN",11/20/2016,
"Last year Activision bought the company who made the game Candy Crush, for… can you guess
for how much?
$5.9 billion dollars!
1 Any video gamers in the crowd this morning?
Whether you like the old school games like Ms. Pac Man or Space Invaders
or the newer stuff like Candy Crush or Call of Duty, there’s one thing they all
have in common: you get multiple lives. You get a do over. If the ghost’s
catch Pac Man, he dies. But, no worries, you get another shot. You get more
lives and you try again.
There’s a reincarnation of sorts where you can try again and again, and
you probably get a little farther with each try. With enough time and effort, you may eventually pass all
the levels. I think I got to the banana level a few times in Ms. Pac Man. But, back in those days it took
a lot of wasted lives and a lot of wasted quarters to get there. But the
Christian life doesn’t work like a video game. We don’t get to come back to
planet earth for another try. We get just one shot; one life to live. That’s it.
How you live this one life is completely up to you. But you can be sure of this,
you won’t get another shot.
This is why we should heed the caution in Ephesians 5:15-16, “Be very
careful, then, how you live—not as unwise but as wise, 16 making the most
of every opportunity, because the days are evil.” We are being urged to live
wisely. Living wisely means that we need to be vigilant in watching out for unwise choices. After all,
the days are evil. Or, perhaps the days really aren’t all that evil? If you think about it, Paul wrote these
words to the Christ-followers living in Ephesus almost 2,000 years ago. Maybe those days were evil,
but that doesn’t necessarily mean these days are evil for us today in Bemidji.
What do you think; are the days evil? Kind of pesimistic isn’t it? Overall, life is pretty good in this
world. Everybody seems to be getting along for the most part. Most of us have a place to live and
food on the table. We have cars to drive around and hobbies like hunting and fishing. We’ve got some
extra money around for Christmas shopping or going out to lunch with a friend. Life is pretty good.
The world is a pretty good place.
If this becomes our perspective on life, we are missing the urgent message from our text this
morning. It’s a message that we need so that we will learn how we should be living as a Christfollower.
As Christians we must guard against spiritual apathy or being content with the condition of
the world around us. There is evil around us. Sin is still having its way in our world. Each day it tries to
do its destructive and wicked work. This results in many people who are really hurting and who are
beginning to recognize their great need for God. And this creates a great need for wise-living Christfollowers.
v. 16 challenges us to make the most of every opportunity. The ESV translates v. 16 “making the
best use of the time.” The NKJV translates it “redeeming the time.” We can’t buy time. But the idea
here is to buy as many opportunities as you can with the time you have. Spend your time on what
matters most because time will eventually run out. We can’t put a spending freeze on time or save it
for a rainy day. It’s already raining; the days are evil. Note that v. 16 is not a call to avoid these evil
days or to fear them. Rather, we are to make the most of the opportunities available in the midst of
these days.
2
Ephesians 2:17 clarifies how to make the most out of our time, “Therefore do not be foolish, but
understand what the Lord’s will is.” Here is an incredibly important question: What is the Lord’s will for Christ-followers? How does Jesus want us to live? First of all, we’re warned not to be foolish; not to
act foolishly or think foolishly. Don’t pursue your own will or live according to your own understanding.
But rather, understand what the Lord wants. By “understanding” V. 17 is not simply talking about “an
intellectual understanding of the Lord’s will” but rather how “God’s gracious saving plan is to lead [us]
to right conduct.”3 Right understanding leads to right behavior.
God’s will was clearly explained to us way back in the beginning of Ephesians 1. He chose us before
the creation of the world to be adopted into His family through Jesus Christ. This was “in accordance
with His pleasure and will.” By God’s grace, we’ve been forgiven of our sin and brought into His
family. And it’s clear from verses like Ephesians 2:10 that we were “created in Christ Jesus to do
good works.” Therefore, we are to live in pursuit of God’s mission. We have important and urgent
work to do! This is what v. 16 was telling us: make the most of every opportunity because once these
evil days come to an end, our opportunities to make an impact will be over.
As we pursue God’s mission with our lives, it keeps us from squandering our opportunities each
day. I’ve squandered a few opportunities in my life. It’s painful for me to recall several times when
there was a door of opportunity for me to fight back against evil or to present the gospel and I just
plain missed it. I was just not paying attention; not being very careful. It’s so easy to get distracted by
the busyness of lesser priorities and the next thing we know, the opportunity has already passed us
by. Sadly, we can’t get these chances back. But, moving forward, we can be more careful to watch for
the next opportunity.
What’s your strategy for living out your faith in evil days? Our present-day world is filled with
opportunities to run hard after God and His purposes for our lost world. When we all get to heaven,
there’ll be plenty of time for other things. But, the one joy we will not have in heaven is making a
difference in this lost world. We can’t afford a “duck and cover” strategy in evil days. It would be
wrong for us to just lay low until the Lord returns. We’re also not supposed to expect others to do the
work that God has uniquely called us to do. We must push aside any tendency to pass the buck or
recruit someone else to do what is clearly the Lord’s will for us. We need to understand what the
Lord’s will is. He is calling each and every Christ-follower to make the most of every opportunity that
he or she has to pursue God’s mission in the world.
Ephesians 5:18-20 goes on to say, “Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery.
Instead, be filled with the Spirit, 19 speaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the
Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, 20 always giving thanks to God the Father
for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” It’s important to understand that every Christfollower
already has the Holy Spirit dwelling within them. For example, back in Ephesians 1:13-14 we
learned that, “…When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit,
14 who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance…”
But here in Ephesians 5:18, it’s talking about something else. It is using a present tense verb in
such a way that it indicates this verse is not talking about a one-time experience of being filled with
the Spirit. Rather, it’s talking about something that happens “Repeatedly, as the occasion requires,
the Spirit empowers [us] for worship, service and testimony.”4 5 So, Christ-followers are intended to
live being filled with the Spirit daily.
The Apostle Paul uses an interesting word picture here. He contrasts the drunkenness of being
filled with wine to the influence of being filled with the Holy Spirit. Now, I don’t know that I would have
gone there; just saying. Does Paul mean that we are to get drunk on the HS? Well, no, not exactly.
That’s probably taking Paul’s illustration a little too literally. Paul is not recommending drunken, out of
control, behavior from the Spirit. Rather, he is saying that positive behaviors will result when we are
being empowered moment by moment by the Spirit. He lists 5 specific results through a series of
participles in vv. 19-21. Being filled with the Spirit results in: - Speaking to one another w/ psalms, hymns, & songs from the Spirit.
- Singing & Making music from your heart to the Lord. (Here we have 2 participles connected by
the conjunction “&.”)
- Giving thanks to God…for everything. (We’ll talk more about this one next Sunday.)
- Submitting to one another. (v. 21 is actually a hinge verse that leads us into the rest of chapter
5 and part of Ephesians 6. We’ll dive into these verses as part of a 3-week series in the future on
husbands/wives, children/parents, and servants/masters.)
For now, let’s get back to Paul’s word picture on drunkenness. The natural result of getting drunk
is debauchery, which is reckless sinful living. The natural result (or should we say the supernatural
result) of being filled with the HS includes the above 5 things. Let’s take time to look at the first few in
this list.
V. 19 connects speaking to one another to three kinds of music; psalms, hymns, and songs from
the spirit. At first, this list seems like 3 particular types of music or genres that are acceptable for
Christians. However, that’s not it at all. We go in a wrong direction when we try to raise one particular
style of music over and above other styles. What v. 19 is really saying is that we are blessed with a
broad range of diverse music out there. Scripture is teaching us to use “every kind of appropriate
song” to worship our God.7
Some music will be right out of our OT book of Psalms. Others will be hymns of praise from
throughout history that celebrate who God is and what He has done for us. And still others will be
songs and choruses prompted by the HS in our contemporary experience, even right up to this very
day and hour. All kinds of styles and genres of music can be prompted “from the Spirit.”
8 Therefore,
God’s Spirit can inspire the heart of a county music writer, a Polka enthusiast, a rock-n-roller, or even
a hip-hop artist.
Love for God expressed through any number of mediums is pleasing to God when it is prompted
by His Holy Spirit.
V. 19 seems to specifically state that we should speak to one another with music. Where is Paul
going with this? It sounds an awful lot like he wants our lives to be a Musical! One of the
first things that this makes me think of is the recent Les Mis movie. It’s a pretty unique
musical because there’s a scene where Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe are singing to
each other. It’s hard for a guy like me not to think of it as X-Men’s Wolverine singing with
the Gladiator.
Well, I’m pretty sure this is not what the Apostle Paul had in mind. In Luke 6:45b Jesus teaches us
that, “…the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.” This is just as true for singing. The more our
hearts are filled with songs of praise and worship, the more our speech toward each other will reflect
God honoring words. Colossians 3:16 summarizes it so well, “Let the message of Christ dwell among
you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and
songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.” So, in our corporate worship but
also in our conversations with one another, let’s not hesitate to let the words from our favorite worship
songs become part of our vocabulary. Without coming across as silly or cliché, let’s embrace the
language of worship as one way that we can build each other up and teach and admonish one
another.
V. 19 says to “sing and make music from your heart to the Lord.” But, should the music be more
traditional or more contemporary? This can be a touchy subject in the Church at large today. Worship
Wars have not helped build up or unify us as Christians. There are some pretty strong feelings and
opinions out there about which music is truly worshipful. The fact is, music is just one way that we
worship God. Any time that we ascribe value and reverence to God, we are worshipping Him.
However, singing is one of the primary ways we express our worship corporately as a Grace
Community. There is a wonderful variety of styles, instruments, and voices that make music a beautiful offering of praise to God. We are blessed to have our worship people get along at our
church.
But, as humans, we have some pretty particular preferences for music. Overall, we each probably
feel that our particular approach is one of the best. And here’s why I think that is: Have you ever seen
a movie or heard a story where a young man is trying to woo the young woman he’s become
enamored with? Perhaps you’ve seen one of the many Romantic Comedies like
Hitch. It seems like in almost every one of these stories, everyone else has their idea
of how the guy should woo the girl. And oftentimes, the reason these movies are so
funny is that the guy tries so hard to “do it the right way.” Ultimately, as is often the
case in real life, each couple has to find their own way to work out their relationship,
to express their feelings for each other. Using someone else’s slick pick-up lines or best dance moves
just never comes across very smoothly. Eventually, a man and a woman just need to be genuine;
speaking and acting from their own heart and in their own style.9
I believe worship music can be this way. Ephesians 5:19 says to “Sing and make music from
YOUR heart to the Lord.” Each one of us longs to genuinely connect with God. And we can only do
that by being ourselves before God and telling Him we love Him in our own words and our own way.
Certain music really moves our hearts toward God. And, when we long to sing to the Lord from our
hearts, certain music just resonates in a more genuine way for us.
So, as a Grace Community we need to give each other that freedom. Let’s recognize that when
we come together corporately for worship, that there will be times that don’t meet your particular
preference. When hundreds of people gather to worship the Lord together, there needs to be a
certain amount of compromise. Some will like the music to be more traditional or more contemporary.
Some will like it louder and some quieter. And some, will want it totally quiet, with no music at all
sometimes. It would be impossible for us to meet all of these preferences all of the time as a church.
So, it’s vital that in a Grace Community we exercise grace in our worship services. If someone
else’s musical selection or style isn’t your thing, understand that it may very much be blessing the
person sitting across the room from you. As long as our songs are in line with God’s Truth and
directed to Him for His glory, there’s no good reason to get upset about it.
Let’s just make sure that all of us sing from our hearts and to the Lord.
If you aren’t experiencing this desire to sing and make music in your heart to the Lord, I’d urge you
to think about that. Our text this morning urges us that this is a fairly natural part of the Christian faith.
It doesn’t mean that all of us have to be great singers or play an instrument. But, following Christ goes
beyond the important realities of believing the right doctrine and obeying God’s laws. Being filled with
the Spirit results in worship; in psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit welling up from the center of
our being.
A vibrant relationship with God should create in our hearts a growing desire to praise God in song.
This can be a way to tell that we are walking in step with the Spirit. And, if this is lacking in our lives, it
can be a helpful warning indicator that perhaps our heart has grown cold toward the Lord. Worship is
more than singing, but Ephesians 5:19 shows us that it is not less. Music is a key activity for Christfollowers.
Being filled with God’s Spirit prompts our hearts toward songs for the Lord.
I began this message with a video game illustration reminding us that we have just one life to live.
Let’s live it with our hearts so filled up with worship that our lives have no room left for foolishness. No
room left for wasting our time on things like drunkenness and debauchery or any other evil that
surrounds us. Let’s live wisely, on mission with God, making the most of every opportunity that
comes along.
",Jerry Johnson,"Bemidji, MN",11/13/2016,
"Earlier this year, Pastor Jerry asked me to preach the Sunday before the election and to say
something relevant to what’s happening in our nation this week. What were you thinking, Jerry? Anyway,
I said that yes, I would be happy to preach. What was I thinking?
As it turns out, my sermon this morning is not so much about politics as it is about answering this
question: how should we as Christians live in relation to politics? How should we respond to our current
political climate? Behind this question is a bigger question: what is our primary mission as Christians?
What should be our focus as we live out our faith in this world? Let’s take a look at 1 Timothy 2:1-7. This
passage offers us a powerful perspective on what God wants his church to look like in relation to the
political realities of our world.
In the book of 1 Timothy the Apostle Paul writes to warn against the dangerous influence of false
teachers. We could spend more time on that, but suffice it to say that Timothy and his Ephesian church
were living in a hostile environment, surrounded by deceitful teachings, sinful lifestyles, and lost people.
Let me say that again: deceitful teachings, sinful lifestyles, and lost people. Does that sound at all familiar
to you? The people in Timothy’s church didn’t face the same political problems we are dealing with in 21st
century America, but they certainly faced some of the same underlying issues.
In 1 Timothy 2, Paul gave instructions about the responsibilities of the church for living in an
environment like this. What were those responsibilities? We can summarize them with three “P’s”:
Prayer, Peace, and the Priority of the gospel.
Prayer
Let’s start with what Paul says about prayer. He writes “I urge, then, first of all, that petitions, prayers,
intercession and thanksgiving be made for all people—for kings and those in authority…”
That’s one of the first things we should do as Christians in response to our political situation. We
should pray for our leaders. That sounds so simple, doesn’t it? But what is it like for us to really pray for
our leaders and our candidates? Paul mentions different kinds of prayers we should pray: besides
prayers in general, these include petitions, intercessions, and thanksgiving. What are those?
A petition is simply a prayer in which we ask God for something we need or desire. We voice our
desires to God, including our political desires. There’s nothing wrong with that. Of course we shouldn’t
assume that what God wants is exactly what we want, and we need to pray “Thy will be done.” But God
still eagerly hears the desires of our hearts. We need to cry out to God about the issues that concern us,
or the things that sadden us or anger us in our country. We can pray for outcomes in this election that we
believe to be best (as long as we remember that God knows that better than we do.) We can pray that
those in power will make decisions that are good for us, our children, our neighbors, and our world.
When we petition God in prayer on behalf of country, it may seem as though we are praying against
our leaders at times. And that’s okay. As we read through the Psalms and the Prophets in the Old
Testament, we see a practice called lament. If you are frustrated or angry or saddened by what we see
going on politically, it’s appropriate to cry out to God. It’s okay to pray against the wrongdoing of leaders.
We are also told to pray prayers of intercession. Intercession is like petition but on behalf of other
people; in this case, on behalf of our leaders. Even while we pray against decisions that we don’t like, we
also need to pray for our leaders. We pray for their needs. We pray that they will have the wisdom and
insight that they need to lead well. We pray that they will make good decisions. We can pray for their
health. And we can certainly pray for them spiritually, that they will respond to God in their own lives.
This could sometimes be a challenge for us. I think of the all of angry things which are said against our
president and against our current candidates, or anyone we disagree with politically. There’s nothing
wrong with feeling those feelings. But what if those emotions cause us to forget that those people we
disagree with are human beings who are loved by God? Can we truly pray for their good?
There is a final kind of prayer Paul mentions here that might be the most challenging of all, and that’s
thanksgiving. We should give thanks for our political leaders. We might want to protest that one. Was
Paul really being realistic? When he wrote that, did have any idea what American politics in the 21st
century would be like? No, but he knew exactly what Roman politics was like in the 1st century. Who was 
the highest human leader in the Roman world at that time? Emperor Nero. Nero was a brutal and
oppressive tyrant. He was also probably insane. Tradition has it that he “fiddled while Rome burned.”
That may or may not be true, but in any case, it shows the kind of reputation he had. And yet in this
context, Paul told his audience to give thanks for him, among their other leaders.
Can we agree with Paul on this as we pray? Can we thank God for Barrack Obama? Will we be able
to thank God for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton? Thanking God for someone doesn’t mean agreeing
with everything that person does or says. But we can thank God that we do have leaders. They play a
necessary role in the world. And our president, our congressmen and women, our supreme court, and
others have incredibly difficult jobs as they work for the common good.
Petitions, intercession, and thanksgiving. We need to pray for our leaders and our country. There will
be an opportunity to pray especially for our nation this afternoon at 4:00. But let’s also take a moment to
pray right now.
“Father, we want to pray this morning for our nation and for our leaders. We thank you that you invite
us to come before you with our prayers. As we approach this challenging time of election, we petition you
for the good of this country. We pray first of all, your will be done. We confess that we easily fall prey to
fear or hostility, but we know that you are in control and that we can trust you. And yet Lord, we do voice
our desires to you. We pray that our president, our president elect, our congressmen and women, and
our judges would honor and promote human life and flourishing in all its forms: born and unborn, rich and
poor, male and female, black and white, Hispanic, and Native American. We pray for justice against
those who do wrong and for compassion for those who suffer. We pray for peace, and for the wisdom to
pursue it in the face of the conflicts in our world.
“We also pray on behalf of our leaders and candidates. We pray for their wellbeing: physically,
mentally, emotionally, ethically, and spiritually. We pray above all that our leaders would be responsive to
you in their hearts and in their lives, that they would know you and that they would live in the truth.
“And Lord, we also give thanks for our leaders. We thank you for their willingness to do jobs that are
incredibly demanding and for which they often endure ceaseless mocking and anger. Even though we
don’t agree with all the decisions our leaders make, we are thankful that you use them to provide the
leadership and order that our world needs.
We pray these things in the name of Jesus. Amen.”
Peace
The second responsibility of God’s people which Paul mentions here is peace. He says that the
ultimate reason we should pray is “that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.”
This is part of what we are to pray for. We should pray that those who govern would lead well so that we
are enabled to live peaceful, God-focused lives. But living this way is also our responsibility, no matter
what our environment may be like.
What does it mean for us to live peaceful and quiet lives? First, “peaceful” does not mean “passive.”
It doesn’t mean apathetically sitting back and watching the world go by. Having a quiet and peaceful life
in this context means living a life that is focused on God’s Kingdom rather than on human conflicts. Paul
connects this peaceful life with godliness and holiness. It’s a life in which our energy is directed toward
pleasing God, loving our neighbor and working out his purposes rather than getting sucked into the
endless power struggles that are so common in our world.
Maybe that sounds like an excuse to disengage or to sit on the sidelines, but I think it is really the
opposite. To be committed to living a peaceful life for the good of others under the Lordship of Jesus
actually requires a good deal of courage. In an environment in which the accepted means of getting
something done is to shout louder and longer than everyone else, living peaceful and quiet lives for good
of those around us can be an act quiet of protest. In a world that feeds on anger and outrage, a
commitment to peace can be revolutionary. It means that we need to resist the pressure to jump onto the
bandwagons of fear or hostility. It means a quiet but firm stand against evil. To live the life Paul
describes here is a courageous stand for God’s kingdom.
The Priority of the Gospel
That brings us to the final point which Paul makes. Here Paul explains that the ultimate focus of our
lives and mission in the world is the gospel. He writes
“This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a
knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man
Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people.”
Paul then goes on to say that this is the driving purpose behind his own calling as a missionary:
“And for this purpose I was appointed a herald and an apostle—I am telling the truth, I am not
lying—and a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles.”
Paul’s priority in life was the gospel—the good news about salvation through Jesus Christ. He wanted
his audience to share that priority. This statement that “God wants all people to be saved” and that Jesus
is a ransom for all people is the culminating point in the passage. Notice Paul’s repetition of the word
“all.” He says to pray for all people and all those in authority. God wants all people to be saved. Jesus is
a ransom for all people.
And, all people need to be saved. The problem of sin is not limited to certain people in certain places
or nations. This problem of separation from God is universal. All are sinners, and God wants all to be
saved. But there is only one way to be saved: Jesus. That’s why this message and this mission are so
urgent. Being right with God is the most important thing in everyone’s life. God cares about everybody.
Jesus is the only way. And God wants everybody to know this truth. That was Paul’s mission. That was
Timothy’s Mission. That is supposed to be our mission, too.
Application
So this is where our passage this morning has taken us. We’ve been reminded that what matters
most to God and what should matter most to us is the gospel. That is our mission. But didn’t I say that I
was going to address the election this morning? What does this message about the supreme importance
of the gospel tell us about the election?
Here’s what I think it should tell us: that we can’t let politics distract us from the gospel. I think that
often—and usually it’s not intentional—we begin to look at our faith through the lens of politics rather than
the other way around. We can start to think that the most important thing is to make sure that such and
such a person gets elected (or doesn’t get elected). That the right laws get put into place. That our rights
and freedoms are protected. That our country remains safe. We are rightfully concerned about these
political problems, and we want to see them answered with political solutions.
And yet these problems we are facing—abortion, same-sex marriage, terrorism, corruption, greed,
racism—are ultimately not political problems. They’re sin problems. They all stem from the fact that we
as humans are in rebellion against our Creator. The ultimate solution to this is not found in American
politics. The solution is found in Jesus Christ. Even if we could accomplish everything we dream on the
political scene, we would not solve the ultimate problem of sin. We would love to promote more public
morality and biblical values in our nation, and I think it is right that we keep trying. But these efforts are
not where we pin our ultimate hope. Our hope is in Jesus. And our most important job is to draw people
to him. That was true before this election, and it will still be true when it is over. After the election this
Tuesday, we will still have the same God, and we will still have the same gospel. Jesus will still be at the
center of God’s plan, and God’s mission of salvation for people everywhere is still our first priority.
I believe that Christians in American have sometimes made the mistake of believing that American
politics are the hinge on which God’s purposes in the world turn. But that doesn’t fit what we read here in
1 Timothy. There are many nations, but just one God and just one mediator. This is one of many
elections, but there is only one Savior. And he died for all people, from every nation. God’s mission
doesn’t center on America; it centers on Jesus and his church. We need to see the world from God’s
point of view: a whole world of lost but loved people whom Christ died to save; who need to hear the truth
of the gospel.
Let’s get a different perspective on this by looking at the early church during the Roman Empire. The
Roman festivals included violent gladiator games and ceremonies worshiping pagan deities and the
emperor. Or look at the sexual ethics of the time. Pedophilia was considered social acceptable. Or
consider the value of human life. Unwanted babies were commonly left out in the streets to die. Or what
about religious freedom: the early Christians often endured terrible persecution. Emperor Nero famously
burned the bodies of Christians on stakes to light his evening dinner parties. If there ever was a time to
wage a political culture war, that was the time. 
And the early church did wage a culture war. But it didn’t have anything to do with lobbying the
government for moral legislation. They didn’t try to get a Christian into the Roman Senate. They didn’t
trust in political strongmen to win victories for them.
Does this mean that they were passive in face of evil? That they were neglecting their call shape the
culture they lived in? That they were “so heavenly minded they were of no earthly good?” Not at all. The
early Christians were culture warriors, but they didn’t fight with the weapons of the world. They didn’t pick
up swords. They didn’t protest. They couldn’t even vote. But what they did was no less politically
revolutionary. They refused to take part in the culture of pagan worship. They would not bow before
Caesar. They rejected participation in the evil behaviors that were normal in society. In the face of the
forces that persecuted them, they said “you can do what you want to our bodies. You can lock them up,
torture them, and kill them. But our souls belong to Jesus. None of your threats can shake our allegiance
to Him.”
Do you know what else they did that was politically revolutionary? They loved their neighbors. They
cared for the poor. In a time when sick people were often held at arm’s length, they brought them into
their homes and even started hospitals. They cared for and adopted the children who were abandoned
on the streets. Do you know what happened? They turned the world upside down. People saw that
Jesus was worth following. The message made its way across the entire Roman world.
Of course our world is very different from theirs. We have many political freedoms such as the right to
vote that we can and should use. But we can learn from their example. As Christians our most important
strategy has never been about politics. It’s about the gospel. It’s about radically following Jesus.
At this point, maybe some of you are thinking “Yes, but does focusing on the priority of the gospel
mean that we live with our heads in sand; that we ignore everything else in life? Does it mean that we
ignore politics because we are only interested in “more spiritual” matters? Does the gospel blindfold us to
what is happening in the world?
Those are good questions. Let’s think of it this way. The gospel is not a blindfold, but a pair of
glasses. All of you should have a pair of these glasses in your bulletin. I would invite you to pull them
out. Our gospel glasses don’t blind us to the needs and issues in the world around us. In fact, it is only
through the gospel that we can see these realities clearly at all; that we can see the world as God sees it.
We need to look at all of life, including politics, through the lens of the gospel.
When we look at the world through our gospel glasses, what do we see? First, we will see that our
world suffers from some major problems. Ultimately, it’s one big problem. We’re all sinners. We are
living out of step with God’s good intentions. It’s a problem that shows up in the moral state of our
culture, in our politics, and let’s not forget, in ourselves too. But here’s the other thing we see more
clearly through our gospel glasses: we see that the solution to our sin problem comes through Jesus. He
is the mediator through whom we are reconciled to God; through whom a broken world can have hope of
being put right.
So when we get discouraged about our political situation, we put on our gospel glasses. And let me
be clear about something: this is not a magic solution that makes the problems disappear. The gospel
glasses are not rose-colored glasses. They are Jesus-colored, and we see the problems for what they
are: sinful, alienated people, ourselves included, who need a savior, a mediator, a ransom.
We need to see our candidates through the gospel glasses: as people to pray for; people whom God
loves and for whom Jesus died. We need to watch the news through our gospel glasses; seeing the
world not as something to run from in fear, or for us to try to control, but as our mission field.
Yes, we look at the world with urgency. But not the urgency of human fear that our world is out of
control; rather with the urgency with which God enacted a rescue mission to save us and bring us into the
knowledge of the truth. Yes, we look at the world with sadness, but not the sadness of human despair;
rather the sadness of Jesus, who wept with compassion over his beloved city of Jerusalem, full of lost
people. Yes, we look at the world with anger, but not the human anger at things which are not going our
way; rather with a godly anger against the forces of sin, evil, and injustice, which ravage God’s good
creation.
But above all, we look at the world with faith, hope, and love. Faith in God, that he knows what he is
doing and that the world has never been outside of his control. Hope, built upon our confidence that God
has good purposes that he has already enacted through Jesus and will one day bring to completion. And
we look at the world with love, seeking the good of our neighbors and above all sharing in God’s desire 
that they will come to a knowledge of the truth about Jesus our savior. And so we do engage in politics;
not because they are ultimate the vehicle of God’s purposes or the object of our hopes, but because our
hope is in Jesus, and we are called to live out the truth of that hope in every arena of life.
You probably noticed that these are 3D glasses. Because of that, we can use them to remember
three D’s of the gospel that should shape the way we look at life and this election: the death of Jesus as
a ransom for the sins of the world, the dominion of Jesus’ kingdom over all, and that we as
the disciples of Jesus live under this lordship and spread this message. We think about the death of
Jesus and remember that our nation and our world are full of lost people who God loves. We remember
that Jesus’ dominion is over all. He is Lord. God is sovereign. And we remember that first and foremost,
we are disciples of Jesus, seeking to follow him, to speak the gospel, and to love our neighbors for his
sake.
So I invite you to put on your gospel glasses. Wear them as you face the election this week. Wear
them into the voting booth. Wear them as you follow the election coverage. Wear them as you talk with
your family and friends. Wear them into your conversations on social media. Wear them as you get
down on your knees and pray for our nation, our leaders, and our world. Wear them as you go out and
love your neighbors.
Of course I don’t mean that you have to wear them literally. (Although you might stick them to your
refrigerator as a reminder.) But we do need to look at this election, our nation, our world, and all of life
through the lens of gospel. So let’s pray for our nation and our leaders. Let’s live out the peaceful
revolution of God’s love. Let’s embrace the priority of the gospel.",Micah Carpenter,"Bemidji, MN",11/6/2016,
" daughter Serena; she was 7 years old at the time. We were talking together while she was sipping
on her hot cocoa and I drank my coffee. She said to me, “Daddy, do you want to play Snorta
or Operation?” Snorta is a game where each person makes barn animal noises…out loud.
As in, let me hear your cow or your chicken or your pig noise. Now for me, sitting in the
public coffee shop, this just didn’t seem like the best idea. So, I said that maybe we should
try the other game: Operation. Operation is the game where you use this little set of
tweezers to operate on the guy lying on the table; the mostly naked guy. I must admit, this
also seemed more than a little awkward to me in a public place.
But for Serena, she was fine with either of these games. She was completely innocent.
To her, these games weren’t embarrassing or something to feel awkward about at all. The
older I get, the more I’ve come to admire the beauty of innocence; even to envy it. It’s
unfortunate that part of growing up usually means losing some, if not most, of our innocence. But, it’s
one thing to lose our innocence about making pig noises in the coffee shop, and it’s another thing to
lose our innocence in our society as a whole.
In Ephesians 5:3-14, our Creator is calling His creation back to a place of innocnece. He’s calling
us to live as Children of Light. The first thing to understand about being Children of Light is that God
calls us out of darkness. If you are a Christ-follower, God has called YOU out of darkness. Ephesians
5:3-4 says, “But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of
impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God’s holy people. 4 Nor should there be
obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking, which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving.”
Christ-followers need to be aware of what’s improper and out of place in the Christian life. This
reminds me of a Calvin/Hobbes cartoon. They are reading the newspaper together and notice a movie
listing with “adult situations.” They say that must mean things like paying taxes and taking responsibility.
They agree this sounds awful and can’t understand why these kinds of movies make any money. If only
this was the kind of adult situation that vv. 3-4 were talking about.
v. 3 lists 3 things that are Improper:2
Sexual immorality: Sex outside of marriage
Any kind of impurity: a state of moral corruption or filthiness
Greed: insatiable desire for more and more
v. 4 lists 3 more things that are out of place:
Obscenity: Shameful or indecent behavior
Foolish talk: Saying something unwise and unbeneficial
Coarse joking: Risqué wit or vulgar speech
I want to invite each of us to do some self-evaluation. Not evaluating others, but just ourselves. As
you look at the six different sins listed here, would you say that any of them are a regular part of your
week? If you were to ask your friends, family, or the people you work with or go to school with, what
would they say? Would they say that you view these things as improper? Would they say that they are
careful not to bring these things up around you because you view them as inappropriate and out of
place?
Or, would they say something else? Would they say that you actually enjoy a dirty joke now and
then? In fact, maybe you even tell a “good” one now and then. Would those around you respond that
sexual immorality and impurity don’t really even seem to bother you. Or, that your conversation and conduct are really not all that different from the non-Christians they know. Now, I’m not suggesting
that Christ-followers need to come across as prudish “holier than thous” or a bunch of “haters.” But,
God’s Word is pretty clear this morning: “among you there MUST NOT BE even a hint!”
Christ-followers have been called out of darkness. As a Child of Light, we should come across as
someone who values holiness and purity. All of the people around us should know that about us. It’s
a key part of our testimony and witness before the world. God has called us out of this junk. So, if any
of it is still around or if it’s creeping back into your life, get rid of any hint of it! You might need to pile
up the old magazines and have a bonfire. You might need to get out your sledgehammer and smash
some things to bits. Repent and get rid of any hint of these things!
Ephesians 5:5-7 goes on to say, “For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy
person—such a person is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let
no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who
are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them.” So, we have here a warning to guard
against Deceivers who call us back into darkness. Rather than respecting the fact that we are
Children of Light, they choose to tempt us away. They challenge our allegiance to following Christ by
deceiving us with empty words. They offer us idolatry in place of our inheritance: idolatry that would
gain the whole world for a short time, in place of the inheritance of our eternity in heaven.
Now, sometimes the intent of these deceivers may be malicious and mean, but more often I think
it’s motivated by a simple lack of understanding. Why would we forsake the pleasures of sin? Why
resist temptation? Who really does that? People who are not yet following Christ may not understand
that God is not saying sex is bad. Rather, God wants us to know that sex, in the wrong context, is
immoral; it’s against His good design. God’s design is that the purity and pleasure of sex be enjoyed
within the context of a committed marriage relationship between one man and one woman. God is not
a buzzkill. As our Creator, HE knows what is best for us sexually.
In these verses, God is calling us to more than just sexual purity though. He’s calling us to purity
of every kind. Purity in our thoughts, motives, and actions. Purity from greed that could lead us to
chase after the things of this world rather than the things of God. This is why v. 5 warns about
idolatry. Idolatry of any kind robs us away from a relationship with the one true God of this universe. It
takes us away from the God who loves us immensely and has wonderful things to teach us and show
us.
These Deceivers find Christ-followers strange though. 1 Peter 4:4 explains it this way, “They are
surprised that you do not join them in their reckless, wild living, and they heap abuse on you.” I was
listening to a radio program a while back. They were talking about statistics on STDs and pregnancy
among teens in the U.S. One of the speakers cracked a joke about the supposed benefits of teaching
abstinence in the public schools.
The uproar of laughter was instantaneous, and loud. The following commentary was filled with
assumptions, that every teen was out there having sex, whether their parents knew it or not. And, that
it was soooo naïve of any adult to think that a campaign for abstinence would have any positive affect
on lowering STDs or teen pregnancy rates.
But there is another point of view. Campaigns like “Virginity Rocks,”
celebrate abstinence as a good option. The back of their t-shirt says,
“I’m loving my husband and I haven’t even met him!” There are many
powerful advantages to saving sex until marriage. These are all part of
God’s good design for sex. Unfortunately, much of our media today
mocks purity and the beautiful innocence that God intends. If we are not careful as Christ-followers,
we can find ourselves becoming desensitized and deceived by these empty3 words. Ephesians 5:7
warns us, “Therefore do not be partners with them.”
4 They will drag you down. And oftentimes, they
aren’t even subtle about it. They are shameless. They are like those in Rom. 1:32: “Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to
do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.”
Here’s something I love about God though; He is a God of grace. He is patient with anyone who is
not yet following Christ. Even though Ephesians 5:6 tells us that God’s wrath comes on those who are
disobedient, we also know that God is patient… God does not want anyone to perish in his or her sin,
but everyone to begin a relationship with Him.5
If you are not yet a Christ-follower, God is calling you out of darkness today. This begins by
understanding God’s great love for you. But you must also understand that Ephesians 5:6 teaches us
that, “God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient.” God’s wrath is real. But you can be spared
from His wrath. Today, you could choose to turn from your sin and to trust Christ for your salvation.
You could pray something like this:
Dear God, thank You for showing Your love by sending Jesus to die on the cross for my sin. I
admit that I have sinned. I haven’t lived the way that You want me to. I believe that Jesus died to pay
the price for my sins. He has made a way for me to get right with You. Today, I choose to turn away
from my sin and to embrace Jesus as my Savior. From this day forward, I choose to follow Jesus as
the Lord of my life. Amen.
This prayer is not a magic incantation. But, it is an example of a way that we can call out to God to
rescue us from darkness. Why not turn to God today? Why not pray this prayer? God is certainly
loving and gracious; but do not make the mistake of thinking He is a pushover. He is not soft on sin.
We must take sin seriously. In fact, God takes our sin so seriously that He sent His one and only Son,
Jesus, to pay the ultimate price, by dying to purchase our salvation.
If you prayed this prayer or if you’d just like to talk with someone more about it, please don’t put
this off. Get a hold of someone today who can help you and encourage you in your faith.
Our text this morning helps us to understand one other thing about being Children of Light: Children
of Light are in the world to shine! Ephesians 5:8 reminds us, “For you were once
darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light.”6
I want you to do
something. Turn off the lights in the room or find a dark corner. Then, think about this:
this is what you once were, darkness. Sit there for about 10 seconds. Then, turn on
the lights and consider this: you are light in the Lord!
Note that v. 8 doesn’t say that we once lived in darkness and now we live in the light. But rather, it
says we were once darkness. And now, we are light. There’s an important nuance here. When we
become a Christ-follower, our outside surroundings don’t change but our inside person does.
“In the Lord,” our essence has changed; we become light. Our union with Christ caused a radical
transformation in us from darkness, to light.7
Ephesians 5:9-10 goes on to explain: “(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness,
righteousness and truth) and find out what pleases the Lord.” This is just what our world needs today:
goodness, righteousness, and truth. It needs Christ-followers to fully live out their faith in ways that
please the Lord.8 Sometimes we look to things like better education, better health care, or better
politics to make our world better. But none of these are nearly as important to our world as better
Christ-followers. The Church is the light of the world!
Christ shines on us so that we can become the light of the world.
Instead of being corrupted by the darkness that surrounds us, Christ-followers are called to exert our
influence on our world.9 We light our world through our efforts right in our church building. Our
ministry to children through Baypoint, Children’s Church, and Nursery are designed to help our little
ones understand the light of Christ. So are our Wednesday night youth and children’s ministries,
which reach our own children as well as those in the community. Our Sunday Morning Adult Small Groups, Section Groups, and Sunday School classes also show people the light of God’s goodness.
This past Friday our 55+ group enjoyed a nice meal and listened to some Christian music. In
December, we’ll enjoy the Women’s Christmas Tea and the Men’s Wild Game Feed. Both of these
illustrate how our church is living out its mission to be a spiritual lighthouse in our community.
We also light our world through our efforts out in our community and world. We support the local
Food shelf and various camps like Shamineau, Deeper Life, and Camp Oak Hills. We send shoe
boxes all over the world through Operation Christmas Child. We have opportunity all week long to be
a light at our jobs, in our schools, and in our neighborhoods. We support our Global Partners through
prayer, finances, and encouragement. We praise God for their activity in bring the light of the Gospel
all around the world. And, some of us are able to go out on short term mission trips and be the light in
those ways.
And the list goes on. V. 10 tells us to “find out what pleases the Lord.” And then, we need to do it.
There is a great video about “The Church” by Pastor J. John. It’s available on You Tube where he
talks about “How To Explain What You Do, When You’re A Pastor:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6TGxKvSqH8
The church is the light of the world! We must live as Children of Light! Brothers and Sisters in
Christ: “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light
a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the
house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and
glorify your Father in heaven.”",Jerry Johnson,"Bemidji, MN",10/30/2016,
"Julius Caesar was a young general as he camped along the Rubicon River, separating
northern Italy from the Region of Gaul. It was January of 49 B.C. and Caesar had become a
threat to those ruling the Roman Empire. He received orders to return to Rome. He knew that
if he did that he would be executed. If he took his army over the Rubicon that he would be a
fugitive, and there would be a Roman civil war.
After considering all of his options, he called his generals together and declared, “the die
are thrown, we will cross the Rubicon.” The expression, “to cross the Rubicon” means to
commit oneself totally in a certain direction, or to a certain cause.”
Israel was now camped just outside of the Promised Land, for the second time in her
history.
The generation that chose not to enter the Promised Land 40 years previously, were
all gone.
That time they chose not to cross into the Promised Land,
not to receive the blessings of God,
not to obey God,
not to move forward.
What would they do this time? This was a key moment for the nation of Israel.
Could they, would they, set themselves on God’s course of action?
In our lives as individuals, and as a church, at times we find ourselves at a key
crossroads.
How do we decide if we are to move ahead, and what direction to go? How do we obey
God in order to move into a different season of ministry life? Are we willing to do so?
In this season of transition, we stand at a crossroads. Let us be intentional, even
aggressive, as we ask questions, as we evaluate. As we seek God’s agenda, and consider
what is next. As we are beginning the Search Process, let us move forward boldly to possess our
Future Promised Land.
Moses had led Israel and spoken for God, for 40 years, but he was not to enter the
Promised Land. Deuteronomy 34 describes the end of Moses life, Deuteronomy 34:9-12. “Now
Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because Moses had laid his hands on
him. So the Israelites listened to him and did what the LORD had commanded Moses. Since then,
no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, who did all those
signs and wonders the LORD sent him to do in Egypt—to Pharaoh and to all his officials and to his
whole land. For no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that
Moses did in the sight of all Israel.”
In chapter 1 of Joshua, the mantle of leadership is passed on to Joshua. God gives him
the assignment of leading Israel into the Promised Land, and leading them to become a nation. 
Joshua 1:1,2 “After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to
Joshua son of Nun, Moses’ aide: “Moses my servant is dead. Now then, you and all these people,
get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land I am about to give to them—to the Israelites.”
The rest of Joshua 1 is a fabulous, practical description of God honoring leadership.
The beginning of Joshua 3 finds Israel camped, in the Valley of Ghor, across the Jordan River
from their final destination.
The Jordan River played an important role in the history of the Jewish people. It is
mentioned in the Old Testament nearly 200 times. Most of the key figures in the Old
Testament crossed the Jordan, many having significant personal and religious experiences
associated with it. In the New Testament John preached and baptized there. Jesus himself
was baptized by John in the Jordan. Where Israel is camped, it is up to 2 miles wide, they
needed to be on the other side.
God gives Israel direction on how to prepare themselves before they enter the Promised
Land.
As you consider what is next in your life, and we move forward as a church, we find a
pattern to follow.
Joshua 3:1-7, Early in the morning Joshua and all the Israelites set out from Shittim and
went to the Jordan, where they camped before crossing over. After three days the officers went
throughout the camp, giving orders to the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of
the LORD your God, and the Levitical priests carrying it, you are to move out from your positions
and follow it. Then you will know which way to go, since you have never been this way before. But
keep a distance of about two thousand cubits
[a] between you and the ark; do not go near it.”
Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do amazing
things among you.” Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and pass on
ahead of the people.” So they took it up and went ahead of them. And the LORD said to Joshua,
“Today I will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all Israel, so they may know that I am with you as I
was with Moses.”
I. Keep your eyes on God (vs. 3)
“When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God…Then you will
know which way to go.”
As hundreds of thousands of Israelites camped on the edge of the Jordan River, they had
to be directed. There is only one place for the people of God to find direction,
....From God Himself. God has been leading them for 40 years, by the pillar of cloud and
fire, now that changes. God does not always continue working in the same way in which He did
in the past. We need to be open to change.
The Ark of the Covenant symbolized God’s presence in their midst. It contained the
stone tablets that contained the Ten Commandments, a jar of manna and Moses’ rod. These
were memorials to what God had already accomplished, the Ark also served as a focus of
God’s ongoing presence with the nation of Israel.
As we consider how to live our lives, where do we seek answers to those life guiding
questions? When we want to look to God for answers, when we want to understand His agenda,
one of the key tools to accomplish this is His word, the Bible.
Is God leading in all areas of your life? God gave Joshua this direction at the time of
his call…Joshua1:8 “Keep this Book of the Law always on your lips; meditate on it day and night, 
so that you may be careful to do everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and
successful.”
That is for us as well!
In Thessalonians we are admonished to “Pray continually.” I Thess. 5:17. Psalm
119:105 “Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light for my path.” These activities cause us to seek
God.
The Bible tells us how and where to go. I cannot overstate the essential value in the life
of a Christ Follower, to read the bible and to spend time with God in prayer on a daily basis.
To take in His truth, and to listen for His voice.
We also keep our eyes on the things of God through, worship music, good preachers
and teachers, time with God’s people-Bible Studies, Small Groups, reading good and challenging
Christian books, looking for God’s presence and activity in all areas of our lives.
We find God’s best blessings in our life when we are looking for God.
When you hear God’s truth, always ask yourself, “how does this apply in my life?” God’s word
is extremely practical.
Keep your focus on God, if you want to possess the Promised Land in your life.
The second direction that God gives is…
2. Don’t let people get in your way.
God’s command to the people of Israel was for them to stay 3,000 feet away from
the Ark. I believe that is so that people could see the Ark. This is what was going
to show them where to go, they needed to see it.
Too often in our lives people get in the way. A relationship becomes too important to us,
distracts us from our walk with God. If they are not walking with God, we can easily be pulled
away from God.
We may get into an argument with someone, even in our church family, which may disrupt
our church life, and even our walk with the Lord. We might get jealous or intimidated by the
gifts of someone else. We might not like something the Pastor says.
In a variety of ways, people may get in the way of our being where God wants us to be,
don’t let that happen. Don’t let other people or relationships get in the way of what God wants to
do in our lives, and the life of the church.
The dilemma here is that we do need relationships. We cannot be the complete man or
woman God created us to be, by ourselves. We need significant friends in our lives. Be
connected, group, class, Bible study, be active in a ministry.
We can/should be influenced, discipled, mentored and taught by a more mature Christian
in really positive ways. And we should influence others as well.
The third thing that we see here that prepares us to enter into the Promised Land and to be a
part of God’s agenda…
3. Consecrate yourself, Joshua 3:5a.
Sin separates us from God and blunts His power in our lives. When we consecrate ourselves we
do 3 things
1. Separate ourselves from our normal life. To consecrate is to “set apart.” On a
regular basis we should designate specific time to be with God. This can be in the
form of a daily quiet time, or a mini retreat, it can be accomplished by your
commitment to church attendance, and the preparation that takes place before you
arrive. It is a separation.
2. Identify and acknowledge the sin in your life. Sin always interferes in our
relationship with God. I John 1:8 If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves
and the truth is not in us.
3. Confess and repent the sin in our lives. 1 John 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is
faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.
We are impacted by all kinds of sin in our lives. If we love Jesus, we will obey what He
says. As we struggle with obedience to Jesus, sin draws us away from being the person that
God knows we can be, and desires us to be. If we put our agenda ahead of God’s, we are
letting sin compromise us. If we drift away from God, if He is not the number one priority in our
lives, then we have not consecrated ourselves before God.
Whatever area in our lives sin has a hold, confess it, repent and give it over to God,
experience freedom from the domination of sin in your life. Otherwise, you can NOT be where
God wants you to be.
Keep our eyes on Him; continue to obey; don’t let others, or circumstances get in the
way; deal with sin in our lives. Then you may be in the Promised Land.
I was out of seminary a couple of months, received a call from a church. They had seen my
resume, and they talked to me about becoming their pastor. I had a couple of great conversations
on the phone, with just one, and then with the committee. I was invited to come and candidate. I
actually visited and preached twice. I didn’t realize that was unusual.
They voted not to call me. It was the first job in my life, I didn’t get hired. I disappointed,
frustrated, and sad. We kept our eyes on Jesus. Eighteen months later…we received a call from a
church less than 30 miles from Christine’s mother and brother, in Minnesota.
That was the Promised Land of God’s plan.
We have a great opportunity in this season to seek God, to work together to accomplish His
purpose, and to set ourselves apart as God’s Holy People, to influence others.
Get ready for the Promised Land.",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",8/30/2015,
"Early in my time serving in Duluth one of the Pastors that I met was Lanny. My first
impression of Lanny was that he was a bit odd. He had long hair, it was what I call a Prince
Valliant style. It hung down to almost his shoulders, bangs down to his eyes, squared off.
Some strange ideas.
The next time I saw Lanny was at the Ministerial Christmas party, where he brought, not
his wife, rather, he brought his mother. Again, I thought, a bit odd.
Later that winter our daughter Rachel, who was four at the time, began to take swimming
lessons at the YMCA. That evening Christine said, “Guess who I met at swimming lessons
today? The wife of that funny pastor that you met, her name is Maureen. They had three
children.”
Not too long, the wives decided it would be a good idea to get our two families together
for dinner. That was really the beginning of a great friendship. We had many things in
common, over the years we spent a lot of time together. Did many things as families and as
couples. Even though we have not lived close to each other for 20 years, they are still some of
our very best friends.
When thinking about relationships, one of the most important relationships in our
lives, is our relationship with God. How does that relationship develop? We see a great
example in Moses, of one who Experiences the Glory of God.
Moses is a key individual in Israel’s history. He started out as a reluctant prophet, an
uneasy servant, a very low key National leader. In today’s passage he is described as a
“friend of God.” Let’s examine Moses’ relationship with God, and see what we can learn to
apply in our lives.
We see two beautiful pictures of this relationship.
Exodus 33:7-11 – Now Moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp
some distance away, calling it the “tent of meeting.” Anyone inquiring of the LORD would
go to the tent of meeting outside the camp. And whenever Moses went out to the tent,
all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents, watching Moses until he
entered the tent. As Moses went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and
stay at the entrance, while the LORD spoke with Moses. Whenever the people saw the
pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, they all stood and worshiped, each at
the entrance to their tent. The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks
to a friend. Then Moses would return to the camp, but his young aide Joshua son of Nun
did not leave the tent.
Moses set a specific place, and likely a regular time to spend with God, in the Tent
of Meeting. The Tent was pitched some distance outside of camp. Anyone could go there to
inquire of God. We don’t see anyone but Moses and Joshua.
It’s placement outside of camp is a reminder of removing distractions when we seek to
spend time with the Lord.
When Moses went to the tent, that was a special event. Seeing Moses walking
through camp, heading for the Tent of Meeting, “All the people rose and stood at the
entrances to their tents.” (verse 8) The word got out. “Moses is heading to the Tent of 
Meeting.” People come out of their tents, stop what they are doing, just to watch Moses go
into God’s presence.
Once Moses was in the tent the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance to the tent. God
has arrived! “While the Lord spoke with Moses.” (verse 9)
While this was taking place “the entire time the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance.”
“They all stood and worshipped.” The people were aware of the importance of Moses’
interaction, so it prompted them to worship, even if at a distance.
Let’s be a good role model. What people see; let’s not only worship at a distance.
Worship God enthusiastically and personally.
“The Lord would speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks with his friend.”
(verse 11)
I don’t think that this is attempting to describe something physical. God isn’t physical,
He is spiritual. I think that this indicates the relational component of the interaction between
God and Moses. I will say more about this in a moment.
This section ends with an interesting observation. Joshua was right there with
Moses, and when Moses is done, Joshua would stay, this tells us a lot about Joshua.
Next we see an interaction between Moses and God. It is important for us to understand
what is being said, and what happens as a result. Moses seems insecure, he wants
assurance from God.
This likely is a reference back to the event immediately before this, Chapter 32, the
story of the Golden Calf.
While Moses was on Mt. Sinai, receiving the law for the first time, the people got
restless, thought he was gone for too long, so created a Golden Calf Idol to worship.
Exodus 32:33-35 – The LORD replied to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against
me I will blot out of my book. Now go, lead the people to the place I spoke of, and my
angel will go before you. However, when the time comes for me to punish, I will punish
them for their sin.”
And the LORD struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the
calf Aaron had made.
Some were punished right there. It is a bit ambiguous as to whether that was all
who would be punished. It also seems to suggest that from this point on, God would send an
angel to guide Israel to the Promised Land. To an extent, maybe God was distancing
Himself from these immoral people.
I think that helps us to understand Exodus 33:12, 13 – (Moses says) “Why should the
Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and
to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring
disaster on your people. Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you
swore by your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I
will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’”
“I don’t know who you will send with me.” Are there more sinners who will be killed?
Are there others who will not be going on this journey?
“If you are pleased with me (if we do have a friendship), continue to be a part of my
life, teach me your ways so that I may know you and continue to find favor with you.
Remember that this nation is your people.”
A sign of friendship, you can say anything and ask anything.
Read Exodus 33:17 – (good thing God is patient and gracious), “I will do the very
thing you have asked, because I am pleased with you and I know you by name.” (Friend key)
We see in this passage the importance of knowing others by name. I think that is
what is meant earlier in the tent of meeting that they talked as friends. The intent of this is
that they really know one another.
When you are really a friend with someone, you know what name they like to be
called. When I was growing up, in school I was called Peter, but since my dad’s name is
Peter, at home I was called David, my middle name. When I was young, you could tell how
people knew me. If they knew me from school, they would call me Peter. If they knew my
family, they likely called me David.
If you ever hear someone call me Pete, what you can be sure of is that they don’t
know me well, or they aren’t my friend. People call my father Pete, but I prefer Peter.
Sometimes we will include in our interaction with people we know well, some additional
descriptor, beyond their name, because we know them well. When I was in seminary, there
were a few of my friends that called me Big Red, because I went to the University of Nebraska
and was a fervent Big Red football fan.
Moses and Jehovah God affirms in their interaction, that they know one another by their
most personal names.
Because of this, Moses request of God is, “Now show me your glory.” (verse 18)
God’s response essentially is, “I will do that.” (verses 19-20)
I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you,
I will proclaim my name,
The Lord, in your presence
I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy
I will have compassion on who I will have compassion,
But you cannot see my face,
no one may see me and live.
God arranges this experience for Moses. “There is a place near me where you may
stand on a rock. When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you
with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back;
but my face must not be seen.”
A cleft is a crack or a separation, so it created an alcove for Moses to squeeze into,
God will protect him. God protects His people and fulfills His promises.
How do you have a relationship with God?
God must know you by name. You ask Jesus into your life as your Savior and Lord.
Romans 10:9 – “If you confess with your mouth ‘Jesus is Lord,’ and believe in you heart that
God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”
Spend focused time with God – In His word and prayer every day. Multiple times per
day; pray without ceasing. Study the Bible by yourself and with others. Spend extended
time with God – personal retreat, Pastor’s R & R. Get away somewhere periodically.
Know God by name – the more you know about Him, the more you know and believe
His word, the more you live by faith, the more you will recognize Him.
The more time you spend with God, the better that you know God. The better that you
know God, the better that your life will be.
Seek God’s agenda. We see the result of this in Exodus 34:6-10:
And he passed in front of Moses, proclaiming, “The LORD, the LORD, the
compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness,
maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and sin. …
“I will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world. The people
you live among will see how awesome is the work that I, the LORD, will do for you.”
My second year at Elim Church in Chicago, we were starting new Small Groups. I asked
a young couple, Jeff and Cara if they would host one in their home. Initially they were quite
hesitant. Cara was extremely shy around new people, and they knew that it was quite a
commitment to open their home every week.
I was finally able to convince them to say yes. We were using Henry Blackaby’s book,
“Experiencing God,” as the basis of our study. The key thesis of this book is…..God is at work
all around, find what He is doing, and become a part of it.
This was one of the most dynamic small groups we have ever been a part of. It
stayed together for two years, and significantly changed the lives of the participants. One
couple went off to China as missionaries, two of the men took key leadership roles in the
church. Shy little Cara became the Chairperson of a regional church planting organization.
They found what God was doing, and became a part of it. They took seriously the
challenge to “Experience God’s Glory!”
How about you?
",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",8/9/2015,
"When I was the Pastor of a church in Chicago, I had the opportunity to attend, more than
once, one of the largest Leadership Conferences in the world, Willow Creek Leadership Summit
outside of Chicago, IL. This year they expect 275,000 people to attend at 375 sites around
North America, and many more tens of thousands in more than 32 countries around the
world. The local site is Oak Hills Christian College.
It is a combination, spectacular worship, pep rally, and Doctoral level teaching on the
subject of leadership in the church, with World class speakers, Pastors of large dynamic churches,
authors and teachers who are at the top of their field, business people and politicians, who have
been wildly successful. You’d think I would be happy about being there….
Yes… but…Usually there are far too many people, seats were too close, temperature
uncomfortable, and everything is crowded. At the end of one session, I needed to get to the
men’s room, I was going to overcome the controls, go quickly up the aisle, cut through an empty
row, almost made it to the door, when an elderly couple were hobbling up the aisle. All of a
sudden they stopped, they were trying to decide what they were going to do for lunch, and
they weren’t going to move from that spot until they had decided. Let the 3,500 people behind us
wait until we know what we are going to do for lunch! I think, in my mind, I complained about
that, just a bit!
Grumbling and complaining, is something we all do sometimes, and there are some who
do it a lot more often. We even see it with God’s people in our next section of their journey.
They had a great Victory, they were freed from slavery, God destroyed their enemies, they daily
experienced God’s presence and His leading. They have begun that Amazing Journey to the
Promised Land. They should be thrilled… but?
Let’s read Exodus 15:22-16:3
22 Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea and they went into the Desert of Shur.
For three days they traveled in the desert without finding water.
23When they came to
Marah, they could not drink its water because it was bitter. (That is why the place is called
Marah.)
24 So the people grumbled against Moses, saying, “What are we to drink?”
25 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. He
threw it into the water, and the water became fit to drink.
There the LORD issued a ruling and instruction for them and put them to the test.
26 He said,
“If you listen carefully to the LORD your God and do what is right in his eyes, if you pay
attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring on you any of the
diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you.”
27 Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees,
and they camped there near the water.
16 The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the Desert of Sin,
which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had
come out of Egypt.
2
In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and
Aaron.
3 The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the LORD’s hand in Egypt!
There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us
out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.
They were right where God led them, they were hot and tired and thirsty from three days
traveling through the dessert. They finally come to a place of water, but find that it is too bitter
to drink, it might even be dangerous to drink. They call it Marah, “bitter.” From a human stand
point, we might understand the perspective, “God, where are you in this?”
Verse 24, “So they grumbled against Moses!” The difficulty of leadership.
Verse 25, Moses “cried out to God.”
“God showed him a piece of wood.”
Threw it in the water, then drinkable.
God provided water.
There is a berry bush, that when put in foul water can clean it up and make it drinkable. It
is called Moringa oleifera, it is highly cultivated in Egypt, along the Nile River and in Northern
Africa, for just such a use.
Did God lead Moses to a provision that He had already created, to solve the problem, or did
God work in a miraculous way? We can’t be sure, but what we know is that God provided.
Keep in mind, we don’t see God provide water that way again. Be careful, when we see
God work a certain way, we may think He will always work that way. Or that is the only way that
He can work. Neither of those are true.
God led them next to Elim, which means Oasis, “a place of rest.” There were 12 fresh
springs and 70 palm trees. Let us consider for a moment the question of, which location was
better for Israel? I am confident that the people of Israel, and I think, most of us here, myself
included, would prefer Elim. Elim clearly was a more comfortable place, but not necessarily the
better place for Israel. Most comfortable is not always the better place for us.
Charles Haddon Spurgeon was a British preacher who lived in the 1800s, and was known
as “the Prince of Preachers.” He gives us an interesting perspective on this question.
Spurgeon writes:
AFTER I had fallen down at Mentone, and was grievously ill, a Brother in Christ
called to me and said, “My dear friend, you have now come to Marah (bitterness).”
I replied, “Yes, and the waters are bitter.” He then said, “But Marah is better than
Elim, for in Elim the Israelites only drank of the water and ate of the fruit of the palm trees,
and that was soon over. But at Marah we read that God, ‘made for them a statute and an
ordinance,’ that was never over.
He continues, “There is much more benefit to be reaped from Marah than from
Elim.”
If we are, indeed, the people of God, we will find it true to the end, that Marah,
though it is bitter, is also better. And albeit that we do not like it, yet in the end there
shall be no bitterness in it, but an unutterable sweetness which shall be ours through time
and eternity!
Whatever the bitter obstacles that we encounter in life's journey we can count on God to
transform them, to use/redeem them for good, as God leads us to Elim. He is able to turn what is
bitter into a resource for the next leg of the journey. God is big enough to deal with, redeem,
and even transform whatever external problems we might face.
As Chapter 16 begins, God leads them, from Elim, to the Desert of Sin, sounds like not a
great place to be. The text says that it is the 15th day of the second month since they left Egypt,
they have been traveling for about six weeks. God’s presence and guidance is obvious every
day, God has provided time and time again as they were in need, in vs. 2 we are told… “The
whole community grumbled.”
Exodus 16:1-5, “The whole Israelite community set out from Elim and came to the
Desert of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month
after they had come out of Egypt. 2
In the desert the whole community grumbled against
Moses and Aaron. 3 The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the LORD’s hand in
Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have
brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.
“
4 Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The
people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them 
and see whether they will follow my instructions. 5 On the sixth day they are to prepare what
they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.”
Verse 2, “The whole community grumbled.” At least there was unity – against Moses and
Aaron. They talked about the “Good old days” back in Egypt, which really weren’t all that good.
Now, they are right where God wants them; they have what they asked for; they were
free, but they are still grumbling, thinking something else would be better.
Exodus 16:13-15, “That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the
morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. When the dew was gone, thin flakes
like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor. When the Israelites saw it, they said
to each other, ‘What is it?’ For they did not know what it was.”
Moses said to them, “It is the bread the LORD has given you to eat.”
God provided manna, every morning and quail, every evening. God said, “I will rain
down bread.” Six mornings per week, “Go out and gather an omer of manna.” An Omer = likely,
3 or 4 liters, a gallon. They had just enough for that day. “On the sixth day, gather enough for
two days.”
Exodus 16: 20, “Some paid no attention,” to these instructions. They gathered too
much, so it began to smell and get maggots. This is what happens when we disobey God.
We too often, miss God’s blessings, cause God’s blessing even to rot, because of lack of
attention to detail and disobedience.
God provided water, where there was no drinkable water; God miraculously provided
manna and quail, so they had plenty to eat.
At the beginning of Exodus 17 we read, vs. 2, they quarreled, they grumbled (again for
lack of water), they complained, they accused Moses, they threatened to stone him. Bad
behavior all over again, will they ever learn their lesson?
I suggest to you this morning that grumbling is based on a perspective, and is ultimately
your choice, whether you will grumble or not!
Why does grumbling happen?
1. We grumble when we are in pain or unhappy.
2. Problem of perception –
Egypt wasn’t as good as they remembered.
Desert was not as bad as they claimed.
The “good ole days,” are not always as good as we remember.
3. Grumbling happens when we don’t get our way.
4. Grumbling is a choice that we make.
Others in the same situation may choose not to complain.
5. Grumbling is a problem of submission
We cannot accept the authority of your leaders.
Also a spiritual battle, submitting to God.
Scripture encourages us to avoid grumbling and complaining. It’s not healthy for us or
for others.
I Cor. 1:10 – “Don’t grumble, as some of them did, and were killed.” Referring to another
illustrious moment in Israel’s history.
Phil. 2:14 – “Do everything without complaining or arguing, so that you may become
blameless and pure, children of God...”
Ex. 15:25 says, “God put them to a test,” in the midst of their complaining. Maybe we
can learn from this.
Exodus 15:26, 27, He said, “If you listen carefully to the LORD your God and do what is
right in his eyes, if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees, I will not bring
on you any of the diseases I brought on the Egyptians, for I am the LORD, who heals you.
Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees,
and they camped there near the water.
Listen carefully to the voice of God. Do what is right in His eyes. Pay attention to His
commands. Keep His decrees. Walk with God; be with Him throughout the day, and… God will
bring blessing in their lives.
Listen to God. Do what He says. He will protect them, and He will provide. Ultimately
God provided a blessing. They came to Elim, a place of rest.
How do we not grumble and complain?
1. Keep your eyes on the Lord, and do what He says.
2. Know that grumbling is sin. You can disagree or feel differently than others, but be
careful how you express it.
3. Carefully examine your motives. Are you a critical person? Not happy about your
life? Not at peace with God? Are you open to how God is at work in and through
others, or are you very self-centered and see things only your way?
4. Think carefully through what you are going to say, will it help? Make sure that
your ultimate goal is to build up and help the other person. Pray for God’s wisdom
and direction, before we speak.
5. Work hard to be a part of the solution.
If you are not a complainer, this might be your attitude…
I am Thankful for....the taxes I pay
....because it means I’m employed.
the clothes that fit a little too snug
....because it means I have enough to eat.
a lawn that needs mowing, and windows that need cleaning
....because it means I have a home.
the lady behind me in church who sings off key.
....because it means that I can hear.
the piles of laundry and ironing
....because it means my loved ones are nearby.
the alarm that goes off in the early morning hours
....because it means that I’m alive.
weariness and aching muscles at the end of the day
....because it means I have been productive.
To complain, or not to complain is a choice, in all things have gratitude to your heavenly
Father, and bless God and others with your attitude, your words and your actions. ",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",7/26/2015,
"Life can sometimes be difficult to face.
From the summer of 2012 to June of 2013, was the most difficult 12 months of our lives.
I was unemployed for 4 months; I had ongoing health concerns for myself. Our
daughter Rachel was in the hospital for a week, with a serious issue that is a form of cancer. My
father had a serious leg infection and was in the hospital for two weeks. Christine's mother broke
her hip, came to recuperate with us, and lived with us for a year. I finally had an opportunity to
serve in another church as an Interim Pastor, but it meant that I had to travel from Florida to
Texas.
Do I win the “poor is me” award yet, or should I go on?
In no way do I believe that my story is worse than others. I know that in many ways, this
could have been very much worse. We have led a very blessed life in many ways.
The reality is that almost all, probably all, of us face difficulties, even tragedies at
some point in our lives. In the midst of these events, we may very well wonder why? Why me?
Why now? How can I face this? How can I deal with this? How can I go on?
The last couple of weeks we listened in as God gave to Moses the assignment of a
lifetime. We are now going to fast forward through the beginning of that task, through Moses’
confrontation with the Pharaoh, past the plagues, and reengage in this story as Moses is
leading Israel out of Egypt.
Exodus 13:17-14:4, When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them on
the road through the Philistine country, though that was shorter. For God said, “If they face
war, they might change their minds and return to Egypt.” So God led the people around by
the desert road toward the Red Sea. The Israelites went up out of Egypt ready for battle.
Moses took the bones of Joseph with him because Joseph had made the Israelites swear
an oath. He had said, “God will surely come to your aid, and then you must carry my bones
up with you from this place.”
After leaving Sukkoth they camped at Etham on the edge of the desert. By day the
LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a
pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night. Neither the pillar of
cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
Then the LORD said to Moses, “Tell the Israelites to turn back and encamp near Pi
Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. They are to encamp by the sea, directly opposite
Baal Zephon. Pharaoh will think, ‘The Israelites are wandering around the land in
confusion, hemmed in by the desert.’ And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue
them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians
will know that I am the LORD.” So the Israelites did this.
Where do we turn? What do we do now? I suspect that is just what the people of Israel
were wondering. As slaves in Egypt, they had cried out to God, He sent a savior in the person
of Moses. God worked in miraculous ways through the plagues, and softening the hearts of the
Egyptians to send them off with a bounty of treasure.
Now they find themselves somewhere on the edge of the Egyptian desert, with a large
body of water in front of them, mountains on either side, and the Egyptian army bearing down
upon them, quite literally…
“Between a Rock and a Hard Place!”
But now, where do they go from here?
Whether we identify events as good or bad, they can, at times, be quite difficult to deal
with. This is true for Israel at this point in her history. It is a great time for celebrations…or is
it?
Let me identify two realities that are important for us to remember when we face
challenges, good and bad in our lives.
I. God does not always lead as expected. (Exodus 13:17, 18)
17 “Celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread, because it was on this very day that I
brought your divisions out of Egypt. Celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the
generations to come. 18 In the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast, from
the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day.”
After 430 years in Egypt, many as oppressed slave, the people of Israel now are on their
way out.
Exodus 12:37 tells us about the first leg of that journey. “The Israelites journeyed from
Rameses to Sukkoth. There were about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides women and
children.”
600,000 men, plus women and children means that there were easily over one million
people, probably two million or more in this group. Let’s get a perspective on just how many
people that is.
If they were walking 10 people side by side, with five feet separating each row, the
line would be 190 miles long. So we are talking about a miracle itself, just to move this group
from one location to another.
God doesn’t always lead us on the shortest or most apparent route. The shortest route
from the Egyptian land of Goshen to the land of Canaan, the promised land, would have taken
Israel due east along the Mediterranean Sea, almost straight to Canaan. God led them another
way. In order to keep them from the country of the Philistines.
Often, when God detours us, slows us down, or even stops us completely, we may not
know why, but, it is always for our best!
Though we don’t know the exact location, what we do know is that they were camped
before a large body of water, according to Exodus 13:18, the Red Sea, literally…the Sea of
Reeds.
They very likely were in a valley of some type that led to the water, with hills or
mountains on both sides of them. Behind them was the Egyptian Desert through which they
had just traveled.
God led them in an unexpected direction, and God led them through an unexpected
means. But God did lead them. Exodus 13:21, 22, “By day the LORD went ahead of them in a
pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that
they could travel by day or night. Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left
its place in front of the people.”
Alright then! That’s what I’m talking about. Wouldn’t that be the ticket, if God were that
obvious in His leading in our lives? It is interesting though to read through the next number of 
chapters to see how the people of Israel respond to God’s leading. Even when He leads in this
visible way, they still grumbled, they still complained, they still were not happy!
Over the past 10 years, Christine and I have been through something of a wilderness
wandering.
We haven’t been where we had hoped to be, not even sure where we were from time
to time, but always believing that God was with us. He was in control; He was guiding us. Not
with a pillar of cloud, or a pillar of fire, but clearly leading us, and providing for us.
When I was finished at my second interim I had no prospects for my next position. I
finished on a Sunday. Tuesday I received a call from a church that I had never heard of. That
Saturday we met with some of the Elders. The following Sunday I preached; two days later
they offered me a position as their interim. I was only off for one Sunday. God is good!
Things go from bad to worse. Pharaoh decided that he had made a mistake. He probably
couldn’t believe that he allowed all of that good cheap labor to leave. He wanted them back.
Encamped before the Red Sea, mountains on either side of them, bearing down upon
them is the Egyptian army, the most powerful army of the day, more than 1,000 chariots, tens
of thousands of soldiers, one mission, to bring them back, dead or alive. God’s people, led by
God, right where God wants them, but in a difficult situation.
 What is about to happen is not what those people would choose, but God was in
control. We have a tendency to give God the credit when we like what is happening, wonder
where God is, or blame the devil when we don’t. We need to increase our view of the
sovereignty of God and seek to trust and serve Him whatever the circumstances.
Maybe you are at a place today that you can identify with the nation of Israel. Things just
aren’t going the way that you had planned. Even when things look bad, how do we react?
Every time it looks bleak and hopeless, God can redeem the events into something
positive for His people, and His plan.
II. God’s people need a God centered response. (Exodus 14:13,14)
13 Moses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the
deliverance the LORD will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see
again. 14 The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still.”
How do they react? How would you react? Exodus 14:10-12, 10 As Pharaoh approached,
the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified
and cried out to the LORD.
11 They said to Moses, “Was it because there were no graves in Egypt
that you brought us to the desert to die? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt?
12 Didn’t we say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians’? It would have been
better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!”
Terrified, grumbling, “We told you so.” There are those in every crowd. Not sure what
to do, where to turn, how to get out of this predicament, no good ideas about what is next, but
very vocal with their complaints, against their leaders, and not trusting the Lord.
Have you ever found yourself in a circumstance in which you felt totally helpless and
hopeless? There are a variety of ways in which we might respond when finding ourselves
in such a difficult situation. Moses gives the people of Israel some direction. I believe it is God
given advice for us to apply in our lives as well. 
Whether you are stuck on the shoreline with the Egyptian army bearing down on you, or
you are in a relatively easy period of your life, Moses’ words here fit God’s will for the life of
the Christ follower.
“Fear Not” (14:13). If we are right with the Lord, and seeking His will in our lives, we have
nothing to be afraid of. We don’t have to be afraid of the Egyptians, or the desert, or the wall
of water on either side as we cross the Red Sea on dry ground.
We need not fear whatever the issue in our lives. I love Paul’s words in Phil. 4:6, “Do
not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving present
your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your
hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”
Memorize those words. It may not be easy, but the follower of Jesus Christ needs not be
afraid whatever it is that they are facing.
“Stand Firm” (14:13). We stand firm on God’s word and on His promises. Of course, we
have to know what they are. We need to know God in order to know that we can trust Him. The
more experience that we have in this, through Bible Study and Prayer, and worship and
fellowship, and the experience of putting our trust in God, the better we will be able to “stand firm.”
“Be still, and let God fight the battle” (14:14). Keep in mind “Our struggle is not against
flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark
world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.” We cannot be successful in
that battle, on our own strength; depend on God.
God has a plan and a purpose. We need to find His direction, obey it, and trust God to
fight the battle. Then we will make it through, not only a difficult beginning. But have victory
throughout the journey.
Townsend illustration – In the early days of Wycliffe Bible Translators in Mexico, Cameron
Townsend, the founder, tried to get permission from the Mexican government to translate the
Scriptures into the languages of the Indian tribes.
The government official to whom he made his request told him, “As long as I am in this
office the Bible will never be translated into the Indian languages, it would only upset hem.”
Townsend did everything he could think of. Went to every official he could find, and
had all his Christian friends praying that God would open this door. But it seemed to remain
totally closed.
Finally, Townsend decided to give up pressing the issue. He and his wife went to live in a
little, obscure Indian village, learned the language, ministered to the people as best they could,
and waited for God to move. Among other ways of helping the village, he showed them how
to irrigate the crops in their area, and their economy blossomed as a result.
This information got back to the President of Mexico. The President was amazed that an
American would come to live in and help a poor Indian village where he couldn’t even get many of
his own people to live.
He came down to the village and met with Mr. Townsend. When he heard what his work
was all about he said, “Of course you can translate the Scriptures into the Indian languages!”
That began a long friendship and opened the doors for Wycliffe Translators through Mexico.
Whatever you are facing in your life today, whatever challenges or opportunities: look for
God’s presence and direction; fear not; stand firm; be still, and let God fight the battle. ",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",7/19/2015,
"Accidents happen, people usually don’t want to admit that it was their fault.
According to the ONE Insurance Company they have received some unusual excuses for
accidents from its policyholders. Here are just a few:
""An invisible car came out of nowhere,
struck my car, and vanished.""
""I had been driving my car for 40 years
when I fell asleep at the wheel and had the accident.""
""The telephone pole was approaching fast.
I attempted to avoid it when it jumped into my front end.""
""The guy was all over the road.
I had to swerve a number of times before I hit him.""
""The pedestrian had no idea which direction to go,
so I ran over him.""
We’ve all made excuses, you know you have.
“The dog ate my homework.”
“My alarm didn’t go off.”
“My battery died on my phone.”
“Traffic was terrible. “
“I don’t feel comfortable doing that.”
I asked the questions last week, “Do you want to hear God’s voice?” “Do you want to
know God’s call in your life?”
But then warned you to be careful what you ask for. Let’s take a look at how Moses
responded to God’s call.
God gives Moses an Opportunity of a life time (Exodus 3 & 4).
It is always a privilege to be a part of what God is doing. That should be our goal in
life, to be a part of God’s plan, to make a difference in people’s lives and in our world.
Ephesians 2:10 “For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works,
which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.”
After He has Moses’ attention, God gives Moses His assignment. Exodus 3:7-10, “The
LORD said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out
because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering. So I have come down
to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good
and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites,
Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me,
and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. So now, go. I am sending you to
Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”
No small task. 
Moses’ reaction after he heard God’s agenda was “say what?” Well, that is a
paraphrase. He actually said (vs. 11), “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the
Israelites out of Egypt.” Moses was not what I would describe as “receptive” to God’s call
in his life. The second half of chapter 3 and the first half of chapter 4 finds Moses telling God
the many reasons why he is not able to answer this call.
When God calls, what is our response? One of the challenges for us is that God’s
call may not be in the form of a voice, calling our name, out of a burning bush.
Oh, I have often pleaded, “God, call me on my phone, send me an email, text or
tweet or send smoke signals.” Make it clear what Your direction is for my life!
But that is not generally how He works. I suggest that we are often not prepared to
receive God’s call in our life.
I think that is why at times we don’t hear it, because we aren’t ready for it.
Therefore we might have excuses like Moses, “who am I?” Or, “why me?” “this is not my
area of giftedness, or interest.” “There must be someone better than I to accomplish
this.”
We often want to know the particulars of the assignment. But that may not be the
best course of action. I imagine that if 10 years ago God had said to me, “Peter, I’m going to
give you an assignment. I’m sending you to a different church every year, or more often.
So you have to move around, live away from home, even away from your wife. You have
to meet new people, learn new names, get use to different cities. And by the way, you will
go to these churches during some of the most difficult times in their history.”
I might have asked Him to send someone else.
Actually, I don’t regret, that this was His plan, or any one of the Interims that I have
served. I always felt that I was right where God wanted me. And I saw God at work each time,
that’s what it is all about.
Moses said, “who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh?” vs. 11.
God could have responded to Moses, “You are the one that I prepared for this task.
Remember, you survived when Hebrew babies were being killed. Remember you were
adopted by the daughter of the Pharaoh, you were raised in the courts of Egypt, you received
the best education and training that Egypt had to offer. You are specially prepared to be able to
accomplish this task.”
We are often more prepared than we realize for what God has called us to do as a
part of His plan.
When God calls us, to accomplish His agenda, He doesn’t expect us to do it on our
own, He is right there with us.
His response to Moses was, “I will be with you.” It is not by ourselves, we are to
accomplish it, God will accomplish it through us. “I can do all things through Christ who
gives me strength.”
Moses continues on with a whole list of additional questions and concerns. He brought
up the issue of authority (vs.13) “Who should I say sent me?” “I AM that I AM.” In this
response God emphasizes that He is the one true God who has always existed, and revealed
himself to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. It is also a way of saying again, I will be with you.
He then goes to the “what if excuse.” (4:1) “What if they don’t believe me?” God gave
him signs. The “what ifs” are hypothetical arguments that we come up with and hope the one of
them will make a difference.
Moses keeps searching for a way out. “It’s not my gift. I can’t do it.” Verse 10, “I am
slow of speech.”
God says “I will help you speak and teach you what to say.”
“There must be someone better than I,” Moses pleads. Verse 13, “O Lord, please
send someone else to do it.”
And of course, Aaron was already on his way to assist Moses. I find it interesting that
Aaron goes along with Moses, but Moses does all of the talking anyway. I’m just saying.
Finally Moses just out right says, “I don’t want to do it, send someone else.” This is
the point at which God had enough. Exodus 4:14 says, “The Lord’s anger burned against
Moses.”
God has infinite patience. It is a good thing for many of us. We need to look for God’s
agenda, not our own agenda, or our comfort zone. We should not resist God’s call in our
life.
But then the discussion was over. God had an answer for each of Moses’ objections
and excuses. God’s conclusion, Moses you will answer this call.
There is so much here in this rich passage, we can only focus on a couple of things.
God places a call in everyone’s life. God has a plan for your life, He is speaking to you,
informing and directing each one of us, every day!
We don’t always hear Him, there may be too much noise in our lives to hear God.
We may not realize how ready we are for that next step, so we are not listening. We may be
filled with excuses and do whatever we can to avoid God’s call.
God’s call comes when our heart is touched by a need with which we are confronted.
We may be moved to action. It may be God’s call when a door of opportunity is opened, and
we should walk through it. God’s call comes as we walk closely with Him, when we pray
daily for His presence and direction, and when we give ourselves completely over to His
plan and purpose in our lives.
How will we respond? There may be some that are here this morning that God is
calling out to, and He is calling you by name, because He wants you to get to know Him. If you
have never asked Jesus into your life, God is calling you.
Maybe He is calling you to walk more closely with Him; to get rid of a sinful behavior or
attitude; to be involved in serving Him in some way; maybe even a significant personal
sacrifice for this.
Let’s be open and responsive.
A year ago I was serving a church in Cedar Rapids Iowa. It was a small church, they
really couldn’t afford to have me there full time, but they had been in significant need. The
District Executive Minister was a friend of mine, so I agreed to help them out. But they really
needed a part time Pastor to serve them. I helped them address some issues, then to find a
Pastor who would start in a couple of months.
I contacted the Director of Interim Pastor Ministries, and let him know that I needed to
look for what was next. I asked if he could try to find me something that would be closer to
Chicago, since my daughters live there, and IPM serves many churches in Illinois. He said that
he would do his best.
A few weeks later he called me to say that there was really nothing coming up that was
right for me, in the Chicago area. Was I willing to go somewhere else? I wanted to serve
churches, and I needed to work. I said yes to consider elsewhere.
He said to me…. Now listen… He said, “how about Bemidji, Minnesota?”
He figured that I wouldn’t have a clue where it was. He forgot the fact that we had
served churches in Minnesota, one in Duluth. So I at least knew where Bemidji was located.
But it was the wrong direction from Chicago, and it was a long way away, from almost
anywhere!
He also told me that there would be pretty high expectations. That the Interim would be
following a much loved, long term Pastor. The church would need help in making that transition,
and getting ready for the next season of their Ministry life.
Of course I said, “Why me Lord, send someone else!”
Actually I said, “Give them my name, let’s see how God leads.” And here I am.
We must respond in openness and with obedience.
Seek to hear God’s voice, desire to be a part of His agenda, and live in obedient
service to Him.
",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",7/12/2015,
"Late one summer evening in Broken Bow, Nebraska, a weary truck driver pulled his rig into
an all-night truck stop. The waitress had just served him when three tough looking, leather
jacketed motorcyclists – of the Hell’s Angels type – decided to give him a hard time. Not only
did they verbally abuse him, one grabbed the hamburger off his plate, another took a handful of his
French fries, and the third picked up his coffee and began to drink it. How would you respond?
Well, this trucker did not respond as one might expect. Instead, he calmly rose, picked
up his check, walked to the front of the room, put the check and his money on the cash register,
and went out the door. The waitress followed him to put the money in the till and stood watching
as the big truck drove away into the night.
When she returned, one of the bikers said to her, ""Well, he’s not much of a man, is he?""
She replied, ""I don’t know about that, but he sure ain’t much of a truck driver. He just ran over
three motorcycles on his way out of the parking lot.""
Anger can develop from an almost infinite numbers of sources. What kinds of things
make people angry? Insults, injury, treated unfairly, you or a loved one hurt physically or
emotionally, someone angry with you, abuse, stress, self-esteem issues, frustration, lack of sleep,
medication. Most often, Self-centered, defensive, or selfish, reactionary, loss of control.
Think about the consequences of Anger…
Physiological
Relationship damaging
People, self esteem damaging
Reputation destroying
Poisons your inner self
Hinders your walk with God
There are some in this congregation today who have experienced broken relationship, loss
of jobs and intense turmoil in their lives because of their inability to control their expression of
anger, some in very extreme ways. Others, sitting right here, are the victims
There sure can be a significant Spiritual impact…
In Numbers 20, Moses was instructed to speak to the rock in order for water to come forth.
Instead, Moses struck the rock twice, likely in a fit of anger against a grumbling nation; the
result, he did not lead Israel into the Promised Land.
Here is what Charles Stanley says about anger… “After poisoning the character, an angry
spirit spills over into other relationships. Hurtful words are thrown like flaming arrows, even at
those who aren't the cause of the rage. Shields of self-protection are raised in an effort to avoid
any future hurts. Unfortunately, the result of these behaviors is stressed relationships and
isolation.”
While anger can damage character and connections with others, its most tragic
consequence is broken fellowship with God. Uncontrolled anger hinders God’s work in and
through believers; it also grieves the Father's heart. He desires to shower His children with
blessings, and for them to live lives filled with joy and peace, but fists full of anger cannot
receive His riches of character and calling.”
Anger is mentioned more than 300 times in scripture. 
*Proverbs 22:24/25 “Do not make friends with a hot-tempered man, do not associate with
one easily angered, or you may learn his ways and get yourself ensnared.” The message is don't
hang out with angry people; don't keep company with hotheads. Bad temper is contagious— don't
get infected.
Proverbs 29:11 “A fool gives full vent to his anger,
 but a wise man keeps himself under control.”
Ephesians 4:26, 27 “In your anger do not sin, do not let the sun go down while you are still
angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.”
""When you lose your temper, you always lose.""
James 1:19-25
The Message: 19-21 “Post this at all the intersections, dear friends: Lead with your ears,
follow up with your tongue, and let anger straggle along in the rear. God's righteousness doesn't
grow from human anger. So throw all spoiled virtue and cancerous evil in the garbage. In simple
humility, let our gardener, God, landscape you with the Word, making a salvation-garden of your
life.”
This is James warning about anger…
Vs. 20 “Man’s anger does not bring about the righteous life that God desires.”
Being consumed and controlled by anger will destroy your life. It destroys the people around
you, especially family members that you love. Probably disrupts your job, making it difficult to
make a living.
And like all sin, anger will separate us from God, you cannot be the person that God
created you to be. If there is anger in you life, you need to address it. If you are in a
relationship with an angry person, and especially if there is emotional or physical abuse, they
need help.
There can be Victory over anger.
It is true that there is no “magic formula” to live the Christian life, or to be who God wants
you to be, no “magic formula,” but there is a formula, there are clear and specific steps that can
be taken, that deal not only with anger, but with other issues that hinder us from being a totally
devoted follower of Jesus…
James gives some sound advice to those who struggle with anger, and for those of us who
wish to glorify God with a “righteous life.”
Quick to listen Slow to speak
Slow to become angry
Get rid of moral filth and evil Experience Humility
Accept/Receive God’s Word Do God’s Word
Let’s unpack that a bit…Be quick to listen (vs. 19). Make sure that you are listening,
hearing the words, and really understanding the meaning of what is being said! Often in
conversation we are more busy thinking about what we will say next, than paying any attention to
the words of the other person. Be an active listener.
Of course, this is even more true if we are angry, there can be so much angst going on
in our head, it drowns out anything that is being said. The # 1 goal in a conversation, the thing of
first importance, to actually hear what is being said.
Be slow to speak (vs. 19). Take your time before you say something. Think it through;
make sure it is accurate; do the words that you are about to say communicate properly you
thoughts, and what emotion will you communicate? Often, HOW we say something is as important
as what we say.
Consider how what we are going to say will impact others. Will it help or hurt the situation?
Use as your guide God’s direction in Ephesians 4:29 “Let no unwholesome word come out of
your mouth, but only that which will build others up, according to their needs, that it may
benefit those who listen.”
Am I helping the situation, and the other person? Scripture identifies many negative
impacts of our words, being critical, slanderous, causes discord or disunity, just to name a few. We
are to avoid these in the use of our words.
Slow to become angry (vs. 19). Count to 10 or 100! Confess and give your anger to
God. Seek to understand your anger. Deal with the causes of your anger. Desire to make a
positive impact.
Get rid of all moral filth (vs. 21). And the evil that is so prevalent. We are exposed to
violence, evil, immorality, ungodly qualities, motivations and aggression, all kinds of things that
compete against the godly qualities and values that should dominate our lives.
What are the sources of the evil and immorality? All around us…TV, movies, music,
internet, video games, advertising, walking down the street…. The more that you can divest your
life of this kind of garbage, the less of a breeding ground for anger, and many other evil
qualities in our life.
This was to empty ourselves…now to fill ourselves.
Humbly accept the word (vs. 21b). Humility is an important quality to nurture in our lives.
Much could be said. Just know that this should be foundational to the man or woman who
wishes to glorify God with their lives, and to experience His greatest blessings.
Vs. 22 “Don’t be merely a hearer of the word, but do what it says also.”
“Not merely a hearer, but begin as a hearer!” Pour God’s word into your life! Read it,
meditate, study it, learn it…but don’t stop there. Also obey it, do what it says.
Vs 22-24. Don't fool yourself into thinking that you are a listener when you are anything
but, letting the Word go in one ear and out the other. Act on what you hear!
Just as a servant is quick to hear his masters voice, and the mother quick to hear her
baby’s smallest cry, so the believer should be quick to hear what God has to say. We listen to
God, and seek to live His way. The more that we do this, the less influence any kind of sinful
behavior or tendencies will we have in our lives, including a natural compulsion towards anger.
Quick to listen Slow to speak
Slow to get angry Rid yourself of immorality and evil
Be a hearer and a doer of God’s word
In addition to this direction, what else does God’s word say as to how you can deal with
anger in your life?
1. Acknowledge anger exists, and desire to get rid of it
“A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.” Prov. 15:1
2. Deal with Anger in your life
“Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of
malice.” Eph. 4:31
“Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret, it leads only to evil.” Psalm 37:8
3. Develop a new nature
Ephesians 4:23, 24 “Be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self,
created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.”
5:1, 2 “Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love…”
Once upon a time there was a little boy with a bad temper. His father gave him a bag of
nails and told him that every time he lost his temper, he should hammer a nail in the fence. The
first day the boy had driven 37 nails into the fence. But gradually, the number of daily nails
dwindled down. He discovered it was easier to hold his temper than to drive those nails into the
fence.
Finally the first day came when the boy didn't lose his temper at all. He proudly told his
father about it. His father said, now every day that you don’t lose your temper, remove one nail.
The days passed and the young boy was finally able to tell his father that all the nails were gone.
The father took his son by the hand and led him to the fence. ""You have done well, my son,
but look at the holes in the fence. The fence will never be the same. When you say or do things
in anger, they leave a scar that will always remain.”
It may be anger that someone in your life can’t control…Or it might be the struggle that you
have to allow God’s Holy Spirit to be in control of this very human, and very dangerous emotion.
Be honest about anger and rage in your life, desire to glorify God and to live a
righteous life; apply God’s word; know that it hinders God’s work in your life, and hurts
those that you love the most; confess your sin and get help.",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",2/1/2015,
"Sometimes life is tough.
Some days can be frustrating, others might be difficult.
Some days it can be hard to get out of bed,
And sometimes life can be almost unbearable…Amen?
How we are impacted by and deal with difficulties and trials, has a great deal to do
with our perspective. Do you think that is true?
The Burning Hut:
The only survivor of a shipwreck washed up on a small, uninhabited island. He
prayed feverishly for God to rescue him, and every day he scanned the horizon for
help, but none seemed forthcoming. Exhausted, he eventually managed to build a little
hut out of driftwood to protect him from the elements, and to store his few possessions.
But then one day, after scavenging for food, he arrived home to find his little
hut in flames, the smoke rolling up to the sky. The worst had happened; everything
was lost.
He was stung with grief and anger. ""God, how could you do this to me!"" he
cried.
Early the next day, however, he was awakened by the sound of a ship that was
approaching the island. It had come to rescue him. ""How did you know I was here?""
asked the weary man of his rescuers. They replied, ""We saw your smoke signal.""
We can live life in a manner so that we are NOT surprised by trials and challenges in
our lives.
We can have the perspective that we find joy in all circumstances of life!
And that even the greatest difficulty is just a challenge to be conquered. And that what
appears to be tragic can be transformed to become a part of God’s plan. We can thrive in
the rough places of life. We can turn trials into triumph. We can begin to accomplish this by
understanding and applying God’s principles. Last week in our study of James we saw “Know
that trials/difficulties are a part of God’s plan. (vs. 2)”
Let me clarify, God doesn’t cause all of the events in our lives, we have free will.
Sometimes through our own decisions, sometimes through the choices of others, terrible things
happen in our world, and in our lives.
According to Romans 8:28, “God causes all things to work together for good, for those
who love Him and are called according to His purpose.”
Secondly, we learned that, “we need to have an understanding mind.” We need to
know and better understand what God wants in our lives, how He expects us to live, and how
God works in our world.
We add two more truths today, from James Ch. 1
II. Develop a believing heart (1:5-8)
Sometimes we understand, sometimes we are aware of the lesson, the growth or the
ministry opportunity. But when we don’t understand, vs. 6 “you must ask God, Believing in
Him, in His control, and in His plan!” If we don’t have a believing heart, we are “Blown
around by the wind, tossed here and there” because we have no anchor.
We will be anchored to God when we know that He has a plan, we understand His truth,
and we believe that truth with all of our heart!
James second truth, “an understanding mind,” was an intellectual exercise, an
increase of our knowledge. This is an exercise of the heart, it is an issue of faith.
Biblical definition of faith, Hebrews 11:1: “Now faith is being sure of what we hope for
and certain of what we do not see.” NIV
Even when we don’t understand, we can’t see what is over the hill or around the corner,
we don’t know what tomorrow will bring, we are not sure how it will turn out, we don’t
understand why or how or when.
But, we still can, and do, trust in God! Amen!
Someone said, “Faith is not believing that God can, it is believing that God will.”
Continue to read through Hebrews 11, see the great challenges that these people
faced, with a believing heart.
During Jesus’ earthly ministry He was asked the question, “what is the most important
commandment.”
What was his answer?
“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all
your mind and with all your strength.”
You love God and believe Him with every part of your being. We want to know, and to
understand. But when we don’t, then we need faith. Then we need to believe God, to trust
Him, and to love Him enough to be confident that he wants what is best for us. That He has our
back.
We learn our theology from the word of God. But I love it when it is echoed from
other places as well.
There is a moving song by the duo Brooks & Dunn,
“I Believe.”
“There is a man who says
he was in the war, he was in the navy,
He lost his wife, lost his baby
Was asked, “How ya keep from going crazy”
How do you deal with these tragedies of life?
“I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what I can see
Oh I believe!
You know I'm more and more convinced
the longer that I live, no, this can't be all there is.
When I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life than just what i can see
I believe, Oh, I believe.”
Do you believe? Say it with me…I believe…I believe
We can experience joy, become the men and women that God wants us to be, and
knows that we can be if
We know the promises of God.
We believe the promises of God.
And by faith, we act on the promises of God.
IV. Learn and Practice Perseverance (vss. 4, 12-18)
12 Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that
person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.
Perseverance is an essential part of the Christian life.
God doesn’t just want us to begin a spiritual journey, or a relationship with Him.
Perseverance is a steady persistence in adhering to a course of action, a belief, or a
purpose; steadfastness. Means that we don’t give up on a difficult task, don’t stop
believing when we don’t understand, and don’t stop trusting when it doesn’t seem to us
to be fair.
Perseverance is to “keep on keeping on.”
It means you remain constant, even in the face of obstacles or discouragement.
Perseverance is being able to bear difficulties calmly and without complaint. It is trying again
and again. When you reach the end of your endurance, and you are ready to give up, you
don’t give up, you keep on going; that is perseverance
Difficult things take a long time, impossible things a little longer. ~Author Unknown
Perseverance through trials can have significant impact in ones life.
There is a man, you might have heard of…
He lost his job as a store clerk when he was 20.
Failed in business 22
Ran for Legislature--defeated 23
Again failed in business 24
Elected to Legislature 25
Defeated for Speaker 29
Defeated for Elector 31
Defeated for Congress 34
Elected to Congress 37
Defeated for Congress 39
Defeated for Senate 46
Defeated for Vice President 47
Defeated for Senate 49
Then at age 51 Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States. He
served as president during one of the most challenging periods in American history. Many
consider him the best President the US ever had. 
How many of us would have persevered through all of that tragedy and defeat?
Lincoln said, “I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming
conviction that I had nowhere else to go. My wisdom and that of all about me seemed
insufficient for the day. We must turn to the good Lord above.”
The trials of life lead to a greater depth of dependence on, and understanding of
God, when we persevere.
Vs. 3,4 “because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance.
Perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking
anything.”
He ties testing of our faith with sin.
During times of trial we might be tempted to sin.
Lack of faith, not believing God is sin
Might attempt to take the easy way out, immoral and sinful.
It might cause us to take our eyes off of God, drift away from Him, even to turn our back
on Him, which of course is the worst choice we can make, and the worst sin of all.
I said last week that dealing with trials, difficulties, tragedies, and opportunities is an
advanced course in Spiritual Maturity. There are lessons that God wants you to learn, and
qualities that He wants to develop in your life.
2 Peter 1:5- 8 is a passage that I call a syllabus for Spiritual Maturity.
It too helps us to move towards maturity, it says…
2 Peter 1: 5 For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to
goodness, knowledge; 6and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverance; and to
perseverance, godliness; 7and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love.
8For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being
ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
Learn these qualities:
Seek to understand them, live by them, apply them
Seek to be available to God so that these qualities increase in your life
Then you will be effective and productive for God, even in the midst of all the
challenges of life.
Know that trials are a part of God’s plan.
Increase your understanding of God’s way of life.
Develop a believing heart, increase your faith!
Learn and Practice Perseverance.
There will be trials in your life, you have a choice to make, how will you respond
when they do?",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",1/25/2015,
"For the past 10 years, Christine and I have been on a journey through a wilderness of
sorts. This time was filled with concern for the future, unemployment, financial struggle, selfesteem
issues, relocation, working away from home and waiting on God.
But also with “God’s provision in small and large ways,” “lessons of faith,” reminders
time and again, we were right where God wanted us to be. So the wilderness journey of
challenges in our lives is an advanced program of God training us to be the men and women
that He wants us to be, knows that we can be, and is the very best for us as well.
What are issues for you today? Unemployment and underemployment, health
challenges even death, relationship struggles, troubles in our marriages, problems with our
children, stresses at work…trouble, trouble, trouble!
How do we deal with trouble, difficulties, persecution and trials in our lives, or in
the life of a church? This is what we will consider in the weeks to come.
As we begin our study of the book of James, I wonder what James knew about the
people to whom he was writing?
It seems most likely that this James was the half-brother of Jesus, mentioned in
Matthew 13:55 ""Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and aren't his
brothers James, Joseph, Simon and Judas?” James later became an important leader in the
early church.
The Letter of James was not written to a specific church, it was a circulating letter, it
was meant to be read and then passed along to others. So the issues and truths that he
addresses are important to a wide variety of people. Including us today!
He is writing to “The 12 tribes scattered among the nations.” (1) We know that much
of this scattering was due to intense persecution of Christians in the early church. So these
are people who understand difficulties, persecution and trials.
James letter is considered one of the most practical in the New Testament, addressing
significant issues of every day life for believers almost 2,000 years ago. These are issues that
are of such universal impact, that they continue to be urgently relevant today. Over the
next number of weeks we want to find out what God’s word has to tell us about “Thriving In the
Rough Places of Life.”
My thesis is this ~ God’s desire is to maximize your life experience and for you to
become the very best you that you can be. This will happen as you not only survive the
challenges of life; He wants you to thrive, to grow, to learn, to be victorious. And to be a
key part of His plan to impact this world with the Good News of Jesus Christ!
Consider what James has to say, James 1:1-5.
In chapter 1, James addresses the issue of challenges, difficulties & trials in our lives, in
particular he helps us to understand how we might experience victory during those challenging
times. We find 4 significant truths that will help us to “Thrive In the Rough Places of Life.”
Consider 2 this week, and two next week.
I. Know that trials/difficulties/challenges are a part of God’s plan. (vs. 2)
James begins his letter with a strong statement about a difficult issue.
“Consider it pure joy, my brothers, whenever you face trials of many kinds.”
Not if, but when you face trials, James assumes that trials will happen. These trials
will be of various kinds. James believes that we can not only survive these trials, but we can
thrive in the midst of them, he says “consider it pure joy…” Say WHAT?
Generally, what is your first reaction when something really bad happens? What do you
say, what might you ask?
Let them answer. “Why me? “I don’t believe it!” “It isn’t fair.” “Where is God in this?
No “Oh goodie?”
I Peter 4:12 “Don’t be surprised at the various trials you are facing, as though
something strange were happening.”
We don’t need to be surprised, and we can experience joy in the midst of these trials,
because they are a part of God’s plan for your life; “the testing of your faith produces
perseverance.” Vs. 3 Testing, in the best sense, is a positive educational tool. Testing helps us
to confirm what we know, and helps us to understand that which we still need to learn.
We are being told here, that God is an active part of your life. He cares about you, and
is interested in your development and spiritual growth. He wants you to become all that you can
be, and He will be a part of the solution to get you there. That reality should bring joy to each
of us.
God’s role in this process, and it’s purpose is declared in, Jeremiah 29:11, “For I know
the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to
give you hope and a future.”
That doesn’t mean that life will be easy, or happen the way we expect. Life as a
Christ Follower is a series of educational, faith stretching challenges. Each one preparing us
for the next greater challenge. With the experiences and opportunities being a part of
accomplishing God’s plan, at the same time molding, shaping, and refining us into the
person that God created us to be.
II. Have an understanding mind (1:3-5)
We can also experience Joy and Victory when we have an understanding mind, that is,
when we know and understand God’s truth better.
In order to succeed in a significant way, you must face significant challenges.
That is true in all areas of life. The athlete must push their bodies almost to the breaking point,
in order to become the best. The scholar must put in a great deal of study and thought in order
to stand out from the crowd. In most areas of life, the more we put into it, the more time,
physical exertion, the more sweat equity we put in, the more we get out of it.
So it makes sense that the more we put into our relationship with God, the more we
know and experience of God in our lives, the more godly, and God influenced will our lives be.
We must know…God wants us to grow and mature, “Perseverance must finish its
work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.” (vs.3)
We must know…God’s desire for our lives is that we might become like Christ.
Jesus’ was willing to sacrifice Himself, and to go through a terrible physical and
emotional ordeal for the benefit of others. Therefore we should be willing to go through the
challenges of life, if this will help us to become like Christ, and therefore, possibly make a
difference in someone else’s life.
Romans 5:3-5 fleshes this process out even more. Read
We know, Galatians 5, that God wants us to develop, fruit of the Spirit, “joy,
peace, patience, kindness, and self-control.”
A young Christian, went to an older believer to ask for prayer. ""Will you please pray that I
may be more patient?"" he asked. The aged saint agreed. They knelt together and the man
began to pray, ""Lord, send this young man tribulation in the morning; send this young man
tribulation in the afternoon; send this young man...."" At that point the young Christian blurted
out, ""No, no, I didn’t ask you to pray for tribulation. I wanted you to pray for patience."" ""Ah,""
responded the wise Christian, ""it’s through tribulation that we learn patience.""
Be careful what you ask for. Dealing with trials in our life can be more effective when we
understand that we have lessons to learn, and this may be the best way to learn those
lessons. We generally learn more from difficult experience in our lives, than from the easy
things.
We can truly find joy in our suffering when we take the focus off of ourselves, and
place it on God and on others.
How do we accomplish this? How do we develop an understanding mind? It will
take time, effort, intentionality and hard work. It won’t look the same for each one, but here are
some suggestions/ observations/ recommendations.
Spiritual growth, is really what we are talking about here, the foundation for this is
the study of the word of God. If you are serious about becoming the man or woman that God
created you to be, you must spend time reading, studying, learning and applying the word
of God. There is no substitute for spending time daily reading the bible, meditating on its truth,
and praying for God to give you wisdom and courage to apply it in your life.
The next stage of learning God’s truth is to study it with others. This can be done
through Bible Study, Small Groups, Sunday School, one on one study. Working with others, in
addition to our personal study, adds to our understanding and the application in our lives.
Others can bring God’s truth to light in a fresh way, we can find new ways in which to apply
these truths, and there is increased accountability in our spiritual lives.
It is not enough to know God’s truth, if we don’t live God’s truth. If we hope to
learn the lessons that God has for us, and we hope to develop the qualities that are important to
God, we need to do our part to live God’s way. To apply all of God’s word that we understand,
and seek to understand more. This is important when dealing with trials in our lives. This helps
us to remember that God has a plan, and through growing closer to God on a daily basis, we
can develop an understanding mind.
Horatio G. Spafford was a pretty well-known lawyer and successful businessman in
Chicago in the 1860’s. Life became challenging for he and his wife Anna, when their son was
killed by scarlet fever at the age of four. Horatio had invested heavily in real estate on the
shores of Lake Michigan. Then, in 1871, just a year after their son’s death, every one of
these holdings was wiped out by the great Chicago Fire.
Two years later, in 1873, Spafford decided his family should take a holiday somewhere
in Europe, and chose England knowing that his friend D. L. Moody would be preaching there in
the fall. Anna, and their four daughters boarded a ship for England. Due to business
commitments Horatio was to follow. Nine days later, Spafford received a telegram from his
wife, it read “Saved alone.”
On November 22, 1873, their French ocean liner, the Ville Du Havre collided with
another vessel, and sank in only 12 minutes, claiming the lives of 226 people, including their
four daughters. Anna was only saved from the fate of her daughters by a plank which
floated beneath her unconscious body and propped her up.
When the survivors of the wreck had been rescued, Mrs. Spafford's first reaction was
one of complete despair. And she immediately recalled the words of a friend, ""It's easy to be
grateful and good when you have so much, but take care that you are not a fair-weather
friend to God.""
Upon hearing the terrible news, Horatio boarded the next ship out of New York to join
his bereaved wife. During the voyage, the captain of the ship called him to the bridge. ""A
careful reckoning has been made"", he said, ""and I believe we are now passing the place
where your families ship was wrecked. The water is three miles deep."" Horatio then returned
to his cabin and penned the lyrics of one of the great hymns of the church.
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.
Say it with me…
It is well, with my soul,
It is well, with my soul,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.
When we can know that difficulties and challenges, trials and testing, even tragedy will
be a part of God’s plan for my life; and when we can develop a mind that better understands
how and why God works, when we can walk closely with God on a daily basis, and be
confident in our relationship with Him, especially through the darkest times of life, then we
too can face all of the circumstances of life, good and bad and declare loudly, “It is well, it is
well, with my soul.”",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",1/18/2015,
"For one of the churches in which I served as an Interim Pastor, I drove 22 miles,
4 or 5 times per week. There were times that all of a sudden I would forget where I
was at. Not that I was in Florida, I knew that I was on my way to the office, or home,
but, all of a sudden I would not be sure if I had come to my exit. Once in a while I
would miss it.
Has that ever happened to you, while you were driving? You are on a welltraveled
route, and you kind of go on autopilot? You are paying attention to your
driving, but not so much paying attention to exactly where you are at?
Sometimes we are so familiar with something, it is such a routine, that we don’t really
pay attention to what we are doing.
Consider communion, in most of the churches I have served, celebrate The
Lord’s Supper, once per month, usually the first Sunday of the month. 50 times a
year, over 33 years in ministry, this is over 1,600 times.
I want to make sure that we don’t go on auto-pilot, when we celebrate
Communion. I want to make sure that we don’t just go through the motions, that we are
aware of the reason for our participation, and that this impacts our lives, every time
that we participate.
* In the Upper Room, as Jesus celebrated with His disciples, the ancient event
of Passover, He also instituted what we call “The Lord’s Supper,” or “Communion.”
The word “communion” comes from Latin and means “to share together.”
This act of remembrance has been an integral part of the Christian church for
2,000 years. Being enacted and practiced regularly, a few times a year, monthly, in
some cases weekly or even daily, as a means of reminding people of Jesus’ sacrifice,
and providing an opportunity to participate in His death and resurrection
Let us better understand the Passover, so that it can deepen our understanding
of Communion.
* Passover is THE major holiday for the Jewish people. It is an opportunity to
remember and celebrate God’s intervention in their history, in which He freed them
from slavery in Egypt. This account is found in the beginning chapters of the book of
Exodus.
God sent Moses and Aaron to speak on behalf of the people of Israel and with
the Authority of God Almighty to the Pharaoh of Egypt. Their message was “Let our
people go.” It eventually took 10 plagues of progressing severity, sent by God, in
order to accomplish this task.
We find in Exodus 11, 12 that these plagues culminated in the Angel of Death
going throughout the land of Egypt and taking the lives of the first born of every
family in Egypt, from Pharaoh himself, to the lowest slave family. 
Each Jewish family was instructed to take blood from a sacrifice and brush it
on the sides and the tops of their doors. For those who followed God’s instructions,
The Angel of Death would Pass over those homes, and not take the life of their first
born.
 God explained why this blood was important in Leviticus 17:11 “For the life of
a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for
yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life.” The
sacrifice that was a part of the First Passover was at the foundation of this concept.
* There is an interesting twist to this pattern of the shedding of blood for the
forgiveness of sins found in the Day of Atonement. In Leviticus 16, God instructs the
High Priest to first make sacrifice for his own sin. This is a reminder that sin in our
lives hinders us from serving God.
The High Priest then takes 2 additional goats, one is sacrificed, his blood is shed
and sprinkled on the altar, the other is then sent into the wilderness, this second
animal is the scapegoat.
Leviticus 16:21,22 “Aaron is to lay both hands on the head of the live goat and
confess over it all the wickedness and rebellion of the Israelites—all their sins—and put
them on the goat’s head. He shall send the goat away into the wilderness... The goat
will carry on itself all their sins to a remote place;…”
Isn’t it interesting that even in the OT sacrificial system, where blood is shed by
the gallons, the life of one goat is sacrificed, his blood is shed, but another goat,
symbolically carrying the sins of the people of God remains alive. Much like
Jesus’ death, and then his resurrection to new life as well.
* The Seder Dinner was established because God wanted to make sure that
they not forget what He had done. This is another powerful parallel to the purpose
and practice of The Lord’s Supper, Jesus said in multiple places “do this in
remembrance of me.” Luke 22:19.
There are many components to the Passover Supper, special utensils and
numerous foods, each one having a purpose, and a symbolism. There are two in
particular that most closely relate to The Lord’s Supper.
* The first is the matzo. a piece of unleavened bread that is much like a cracker.
Instruction on the preparation of this bread is given in various places in the Jewish
Torah, our OT.
You can find details in Exodus 13:1-10. This passage lets us know that when
this hard, unleavened cracker is eaten during the Seder dinner, it is a reminder of how
God miraculously helped Israel to flee from Egypt, which they had to do quickly w no
time for leaven to rise.
* In Jewish theology, leaven is also identified with sin and corruption. It is seen
this way since it is the leaven, or the yeast that causes the bread to rise, or to “puff
up.” And so sin, especially the sin of pride, causes God’s people to “puff up.” 
Because of this, in preparation for Passover, all leaven must be cleaned out of a
person’s home, and for 7 days you can eat nothing with leaven.
* During the meal, there is a pouch that contains 3 pieces of matzo. At one point,
the middle piece is taken out of the bag, broken, half is put back into the bag. The
other half is wrapped in a linen napkin and hidden, to be found later, after the meal. At
the appropriate time, this hidden piece of matzo is found.
It is then broken up into pieces and distributed to everyone seated around
the table, who then eat their piece. The thought is that these pieces of matzo bring a
good, and long life to those who eat them. Sound familiar?
* The other major component of The Lord’s Supper is the cup of juice or wine.
Wine plays a key role in the Seder Dinner. There are actually 4 cups of wine served
during this celebration, the 3rd cup, which is taken after the meal. This is the cup of
redemption, which reminds those at the table of the shed blood of the innocent Lamb
which brought their redemption from Egypt.
Let us now consider some parallels and significant symbolism in the
actions of Jesus, in that Upper Room, on the evening before His crucifixion, when He
instituted the Last Supper. We can see how God directed the nation of Israel to
establish a tradition that reflected their history, but also prophetically pointed to
salvation in Jesus Christ.
* Remember the 3 matzos hidden in the little bag? Here is a picture of a matzah,
where you can clearly see the stripes and the piercings in the cracker. Jesus said,
“This is My body, broken for you.” He was beaten and pierced in our place. Isaiah
53:5 tells us, “But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our
iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his
wounds/stripes we are healed.”
That middle matzo, is also Jesus’ body, broken for us. Once it was broken, half
was then wrapped, in a linen napkin, and hidden, as His body was wrapped in a
burial cloth and buried. The Matzo later to be found, Jesus to be raised from the
dead. Once found, it would then be passed out and consumed, or taken into the
lives of His people, which gives them the promise of abundant life, and eternal life.
* Remember in the Passover there is blood shed for protection and forgiveness.
Read Leviticus 16 to see how all of this fits together. Hebrews 9:22 tells us,
“without the shedding of blood there can be no remission (NIV), or no forgiveness of
sins (ESV)
With the Scapegoat, the High Priest will lay hands on the live goat, and confess
the sins of the nation over it, then it is released into the wilderness. So we see the
dead sacrifice, the shed blood, then the sins placed upon the living sacrifice as
our sins are placed upon Jesus who shed His blood on the cross for our sins. When
Jesus came to John the Baptist to be baptized, John declared, “Behold, the Lamb of
God, who takes away the sin of the world!” John 1:29 The Scapegoat.
* We see that Jesus took the cup in Luke 22:20 and 1 Corinthians 11:25, ""In the
same way, after supper he took the cup, saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my 
blood; do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.'"" This was not just
any cup, it was the cup of redemption from slavery into freedom, from sin to
forgiveness, and the transformation in our lives, from death to new life.
This is our communion cup.
Jesus provided for us an opportunity to revisit these events, to remember what
He did, and why, and to consider again, each time we participate, how this will affect
our lives.
How spectacular, that God was already infusing the history and traditions of His
Chosen People, with a beautiful picture of what would be accomplished in and
through Jesus Christ!
* He too was without defect, He had no sin, yet He willingly provided Himself to
be our sacrifice. And for the first time in history, provide an adequate sacrifice, one
that truly could pay the penalty for the sins of all of the people, everywhere and for all
time.
In a few moments we will offer you the bread and the cup, these represent the
body and the blood of Jesus. The presence of the bread, His body is a reminder that
God Himself stepped off of His throne, and that he gave up the position and the power
of deity, because He was the only one who could accomplish this purpose. And
that physical body was beaten and pierced, and broken, and suffered during this
process.
Then you will hold the cup, whose content represents the blood of Jesus. “He
was pierced for our transgressions.” “It is by his blood that the penalty for our
sins is paid.” And it is a symbol of the new relationship that we have with our heavenly
Father.
Let us never taken for granted these events, or this sacrifice….

"Has anyone made New Years Resolutions?
I won’t ask you what they are, don’t want to put too much pressure on you.
The Internet listed the five most popular resolutions as:
1. Lose weight / exercise
2. Stop smoking
3. Improve relationships
4. Make more money
5. Take up a new hobby
Christian Resolutions
1. More Family Time
2. Start or more consistent DQT
3. Read through the Bible
4. Give more money
5. Be more involved Church / God’s work
Here are a few Affirmations
1. I assume full responsibility for my actions, except the ones that are someone
else’s fault.
2. I need not suffer in silence, while I can still moan, whimper, and complain.
3. Today I will gladly share my experience and advice, for there are no sweeter
words than ""I told you so!""
4. Just for today, I will not sit in my living room all day. Instead, I will move my
computer into the bedroom.
5. I will no longer waste my time reliving the past; I will spend it worrying about the
future.
6. Before I criticize a man, I will walk a mile in his shoes. That way, if he gets angry,
he's a mile away and barefoot.
The beginning of a New Year is a great opportunity to step back and get our
bearings. To take a look at our lives, where we have been, where we are today, and where we
are going in the year to come. And whether we make resolutions, affirmations, or something
altogether different, that you take steps to make this year better than last, and move in the
direction that God has planned for you, letting Him guide and direct as you grow more
dependent on Him and obedient to Him.
We have a tendency to live our lives as though we have all the time in the world.
There is always tomorrow, next week, next month, next year. We often feel like we can improve
our lives…later. We often don’t have much of a sense of urgency.
Two events have recently reminded me of this in a powerful way. We heard 2 weeks
ago that a man from the church that I Pastored in Chicago, who was the same age as
myself, finished a long run, was standing in front of his home chatting with a neighbor, and fell
over, dead from a heart attack. We never know when our time will come.
I had 3 sisters. Our youngest sister, Roni was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2012, 6
months later, in January of 2013, she passed away. We think we have all of the time in the
world, there is always next week, or next month…but that is not always true. Circumstances
change, you may lose your window of opportunity, or your life may come to an end.
This morning, increase your sense of urgency about making changes that will impact
your life. Know that God wants you to live your life, in a way, which will matter for eternity.
Let us turn to Philippians, ch. 3, where we will find many challenging ideas that could
become goals in our lives. Paul sets up an extremely high standard.
He challenges us to be
Be like minded
Consider others better than ourselves
Our attitude to be the same as that of Christ Jesus
These are challenging and valuable goals, resolutions, or affirmations that we could
follow. But the verses following elevates the goals for Followers of Christ even more,
READ along with me 3:7-14
Whether we are to consider valuable goals, resolutions, affirmations, or changes to our
life style, consider Paul’s Powerful Priorities.
I. Dissatisfaction (vss. 7,8,12)
We see the accomplishments that Paul can claim:
Circumcised on the eighth day – Pure Jew, not a proselyte, who came to God
later. Lived it his whole life.
Of the people of Israel – One of God’s chosen people
Of the tribe of Benjamin – Only Patriarch born in the Promised Land. First king
of Israel, Saul, from this tribe.
A Hebrew of Hebrews –
Both parents spoke Hebrew, He lived it
Don’t get more connected than Paul
In regard to the law – Pharisee – Knew and obeyed
As for zeal, persecutor of the church
As for legalistic righteousness, faultless
Paul was a super star, he was a hoitie toitie, part of the elite. He was a shining example
of what the Jews of his day strove to be, He had it all, he had arrived!
But Paul understood that his worldly achievements really are not the stuff that matters.
He says… (7) “Whatever was to my profit – I now consider loss…. (8) What’s more, I
consider everything a loss” I consider them rubbish. KJV – “dung”, refuse, waste
What does society, and other people say is important, success, happiness,
possessions, power, relationships?
Paul is saying, put all of it on one side of the scale and put Jesus on the other side
of the scale, what happens?
Nothing else matters! It is nothing, compared to Jesus! Nothing else matters! It is
ALL about Jesus ~ Amen?
We raise many things as a banner of success or value, even within the church.
Ethnic, or religious heritage, translation of the bible, attendance at church events, education,
economic level, where we live, kind of job, styles of worship, do’s and don’ts.
Paul is telling us that we should not esteem any of those things. It is ALL about
Jesus.
Paul is at the top of people of faith, joy, and commitment to Jesus Christ…But Paul
says… (12) “Not that I have already obtained all this.” I’m not there yet, he is not satisfied
with his spiritual or personal attainments.
The Christian life, ~ Is a road, a path, a journey – never ends, must keep moving;
constantly growing, maturing, learning, changing, breaking out of our comfort zone, always
have room for improvement. Don’t be satisfied; don’t settle for anything less than the most
powerful of God’s priorities to pursue in your life. There are always more!
II. Determination (vss. 12, 13, 14)
Paul speaks of direction, focus, dedication, commitment, enthusiasm, perseverance,
(13b) “Forgetting what is behind.”
The past can be a great deterrent to achieving our priorities or goals. Plagued by
guilt of past sins, failures, struggles, detours, mistakes, what might have been... You may
think ~ I’m not now where I wish to be in relationships, finances, career, physically, spiritually.
Therefore, why even try?
We might focus on past… Victories and successes; the “good old days;” I have already
achieved in whatever endeavor; “Now I’m finished!”
Paul says… Vs. 13 “Forgetting what is behind, what is in our past.” “Forget”
doesn’t mean “fail to remember.” It is godly and appropriate to rejoice in the good things, be
thankful for and remember lessons learned. Be aware of the impact of our failures and sin.
BUT “No longer be influenced by, or affected by them.” Other than in positive ways.
Don’t allow sin to control your life; no longer let guilt drag you down; no longer allow fear stop
you from trying; no longer bask in the glory of success so that it hinders the glorious future
opportunities that God places before you.
The things which are behind “must be set aside” to make room for the things which are
ahead for each of us.
Forget what is behind, “Press on” to what is ahead. Vss. (12) “I press on”
(13, 14) “Strain toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal.”
This is an athletic illustration. The runner pumping furiously, striding as quickly as he
can, body at an angle, straining ahead to reach the finish line first. This speaks to direction
and determination. Hard work, and a clear goal, or priorities for your life, in all areas.
At what will you work hard and apply yourself for this year?
III. Devotion (8, 10, 13)
The tone is set in vs 13, “But this one thing I do.” Paul brings our focus on the
powerful priorities that should govern and direct our lives.
Straining toward the goal – “to win the prize.” “For which God has called me in
Christ.” (vs. 14) That thing that makes my life matter, my creator set my life into motion for
this thing. That is the single focus of this race we call life.
Look at the priorities that Paul sets out for us: (10) “I want to know Christ”, (8) “I
want to gain Christ;” (8) “The surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.”
Not just know who He is, that He exists. To know Him in the most intimate of sense. That 
you walk and talk with Him; He is with you every day, to know Him from abundant personal
experience. “To know… the power of His resurrection,” to bring the dead back to life is
impossible. The power to do the impossible, work miracles, step out in faith. To see my life,
and the lives of others impacted in significant ways.
“To know… the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings.” To understand all that He
gave up and suffered for me. Realize that things aren’t as bad as I sometimes believe.
Fellowship really is, meaningful relationship. Meaningful relationship with Jesus and with
others. “Becoming like Him in His death.” Total obedience and sacrifice.
Paul is saying that we are to give our all to gain this intimate and complete
relationship with Christ.
In 1981, winner of the Oscar for best picture was “Chariot’s of Fire.” An up lifting film
that described the challenges of Scottish runner, Eric Liddell in the 1920’s.
He made the Scottish Olympic team for the 1924 Olympics in Paris France, in the 100 &
220 meter races. He chose not to compete in the 100 meters, because the finals would be run
on Sunday. Being a committed Christian he refused to run on the Lord’s day. He competed in
the 400 meter instead. He was handed a note before the race that said “God honors those who
honor Him!” He won the race, won the gold medal, and set a world record.
A Great scene in the movie – His sister wants him to be a missionary, not spend his time
racing. He says to her, “I believe God made me for a purpose; but He also made me fast. And
when I run I feel His pleasure.” He used all the gifts that God gave him, but none
overshadowed His commitment to honor God. Shortly after the Olympics Eric Liddell went to
China as a missionary. In 1945 he died in a Japanese prison camp. He gave His all, for the
glory of Christ.
For what were you created? What gives God pleasure in your life? What “One
Thing” must you do?
How might 2015 be a transformational year in your life?

Memorize Phil 3:7-14, live by it. How would your life be different if you started each
day committing to these affirmations?
I want to Know Christ –
I want to Gain Christ –
Faith in the power of Christ
Fellowship of His suffering –
Be dissatisfied.
Be determined.
Be devoted.
",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",1/4/2015,
"I hope that preacher isn’t too long, or too boring today!
I hope the music isn’t too loud!
I hope the Vikings will win….
that may be too much to hope for.
We hope for many things, a new job, that raise, the new girl, you won’t hit bad traffic,
get into a good school, good health, finding love, much to hope for.
Hope is a multi-faceted concept that impacts us almost every step of every day.
It is closely related to faith, dynamic faith is dependent on the object of that faith, so
when we put our faith in God, we are never disappointed.
Hope on the other hand, is a component of faith. “Faith is being sure of what we
hope for and certain of what we do not see.” Hebrews 11:1
These weeks leading up to Christmas we are considering Faith, hope and love found
in Christmas.
We know from Paul’s description found in I Cor. 13 that faith, hope and love are
essential and valuable components of the vital Christian life. In Colossians 1:5 he informs us
that “faith and love spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven.” The
assumption is that God has stored this hope for us, and pours it out as His blessing in our lives
as a significant resource as we live our lives for His glory.
What do you hope for this Christmas?
Hope - To desire with expectation of fulfillment. To wish or want. It is a
confident expectation.
Homer - “Hope is golden” It was an essential aspect of Greek and Roman
philosophy that people could find hope in the future in spite of uncertainty and
distress.
Clare Boothe Luce, “There are no hopeless situations; there are only people
who have grown hopeless about them.”
Matthew Henry, “The ground of our hope is Christ in the world, but the evidence
of our hope is Christ in the heart.”
“Other men see only a hopeless end, but the Christian rejoices in an endless hope.”
The reality is that when we walk closely with God, our lives are filled with hope.
Biblical understanding - “A positive expectation for the future.” Scripture has much to
say about hope…
Hope is found over 200 times in OT - most often with a focus on God as our hope, or in
the negative - “those that don’t have God, are without hope.”
Psalm 33:20-22 {20} We wait in hope for the LORD; he is our help and our shield.
{21} In him our hearts rejoice, for we trust in his holy name. {22} May your unfailing love
rest upon us, O LORD, even as we put our hope in you.
Hope is found 80 times in the New Testament, usually:
“Jesus is our, or offers us hope.”
Rom. 5:5 “Hope does not disappoint us, because God has poured out his
love into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, whom he has given us.”
Do you have a confident assurance of God’s presence in your life? Are you anxiously
anticipating how God will pour out His glory? Do you have this hope?
Throughout the Christmas story, we see this God centered hope!
One of those places it is found is with the “wise men” who came from the east in search
of the “King of the Jews”?
Who were these men?
Some wonder what might have been different had the wise men been wise women?
1. They would have asked for directions before they arrived in Jerusalem and not have
alerted evil king Herod.
2. They would have arrived on time and helped deliver the baby
3. They would have cleaned the stable.
4. They would have brought gifts practical for the family– like a casseroles, diapers,
and baby wipes.
The Bible simply calls them “Magi.” This a term that described Persian and
Babylonian wise men and priests, men who were experts in astrology, interpretation of
dreams and various other secret and magical arts. It is likely that they came from ancient
Persia, from the area of modern day Iraq.
The Good News Bible calls them “some men who studied the stars.” They were
among the most educated people of their day and were respected for their scholarship
and wisdom. They represent the scientists of the day.
As key advisors to royalty, the Magi of the Ancient East played a role in crowning kings.
This may have contributed to Herod’s fear when they arrived in Jerusalem, looking for the
“King of the Jews.
Traditions have risen up around these mysterious visitors. They are thought to be three
in number because that is the number of the gifts that were brought. So we sing “We Three
Kings of Orient Are.” Even though in scripture they are never referred to as kings.
It is unlikely that three intelligent and important men would travel alone. So there likely
would be a caravan much larger than three that would make the journey, so we don’t know if
there were 1, 3, 10 or 30 that visited the Christ child.
If they were from Persia or further away, their trip would have been 1,000 miles or
more, a significant journey in that day, it would have taken at least many months.
Also, keep in mind, they saw a star that designated an important birth. If they left
shortly after seeing the star it would have taken some time for them to arrive. It would not
have been the very night that Jesus was born. Maybe months, even up to two years after His
birth they arrived.
Matthew 2 says vs. 10,11 “When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. On
coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary.” The new family has 
moved from the stable, into a house before they arrived. And Herod had babies up to 2 years
killed in order to eliminate this child.
The Magi brought gifts to offer as they worshiped. One person suggested that there
were actually four wise men. That they brought gold, frankincense, myrrh and the fourth
brought fruitcake, but that they don’t talk about him.
Some interpreters of scripture have understood these gifts to be symbolic.
Gold denotes royalty, authority, and power, it focuses on the kingship of Jesus.
Frankincense was used in temple offerings and represents the priestly aspect of Christ.
Myrrh is a spice that is used to prepare bodies for burial, and that represents the
sacrificial death of Jesus.
There are some things that we do know.
I. These men were seeking the true God
Their journey was one of hope. Where ever they came from, how ever many
there were, how ever they gathered their information, it led them to the Christ child.
They had some knowledge, though it was incomplete,
It motivated them to travel hundreds of miles, over many months, to some
place they have never been. Because they knew they needed something in their lives.
The message of Christmas is a message of hope.
Galatians 4:4 But when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a
woman, born under law, to redeem those under law, that we might receive the full rights
of sons.
Christmas shows us:
God responded to our greatest need – forgiveness
By giving the greatest Person – Jesus Christ
To make the greatest sacrifice – His death on the cross
To offer us the greatest gift – eternal life
Salvation is God’s indescribable gift!
II. They took action
They could have noted the appearance of the star in their log books, indicated their
conviction that this phenomenon heralded something or someone very special, and then
gone about their business. But no, they put commitment to their convictions, feet to their
faith, pursued the hope that they felt, and began the journey.
They knew this was something special, they may have known it was from God, they
weren’t sure what they would find, it would be difficult, dangerous, even costly.
Hope motivates us to action.
When God presents us with some new opportunity, when some “blessed hope” is laid
out before us, are we ready to get up .... out of our comfort zones, and begin a journey of
hope and faith? The story of the Wise Men says that there is something special that awaits us
at the finish if we are motivated by hope to follow God’s star, to follow His leading in our lives.
III. They Worshiped Jesus
They bowed before “Emmanuel, God with us,” and presented their gifts. We know
that the day will come…
Philippians 2:9-11 “Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the
name that is above every name,
that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.”
The gifts of the Magi, were merely tokens of their recognition of Christ being a very
special person. The reality is that any gift you give to God represents the fact that you are
giving yourself to Him. What we give to God has nothing to do with what anyone else gives to
Him. Don’t worry about the gifts you bring
Don’t compare yourself to others, give the best you have, and do the best that you can.
See what opportunities God lays out if front of you, and be willing to do whatever you can to
meet that need. Recognize that all that we are, and all that we have belongs to God, use it as
though we believe it.
The best gift that we can give to Jesus, is ourselves.
My mother passed away three years ago. About a year before she died, the doctors
found that she had an aneurism on an artery near her kidney. She was not a candidate for a
bypass, but the doctor thought that he could put in a stint that would reinforce the weak spot on
her artery. There was no guarantee that she would survive the surgery, and they weren’t
sure how long she would survive, even with the procedure.
The day before she was to have the procedure I had lunch with her. She was in a
surprisingly upbeat mood. She happily spoke of the phone calls and visits that she had
received from friends and family telling her that they loved her, wishing her luck, and many
saying that they were praying for her. She said, “I must not be such a bad person for all of
those people to care about me.”
Then I asked her where she was with God, in the midst of this life threatening
circumstance. She said, “she made her peace with God.” She didn’t really have a
relationship with Him for much8 of her life, though she believed that He existed. But now she
knew that she needed to have Him in her life. I specifically asked her if she knew that she was
a sinner, that Jesus died for her sins, and ask Him to come into her life as her savior and lord?
She said, “yes Son, I asked Jesus into my life, I am at peace with God. The last two years
of her life were her most peaceful & hopeful.
As you walk with Christ, you are filled with His hope.
Make God a priority in your life this Christmas, and throughout the year, and your life can be
fueled by hope
What do you hope for this Christmas? Do you find a positive outlook in this question, as
you put your trust in Christ?
Wise Men and Women still seek Him!",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",12/14/2014,
"There were two brothers who were quite different from each other. One was an eternal
optimist; while the other was a terrible pessimist. Their father hoped to help them each not
be quite so extreme, he had an idea. For Christmas one year he selected a special gift for each
of his sons. For the pessimist he purchased the most popular electronic game of the
year. It was what every young person wanted under their tree.
When he opened it his father was surprised to hear him begin to cry. He said to his son,
“why are you crying?” His boy answered, “all of my friends wanted this game, they will be
jealous of me, they will think that I am stuck up and not want to play with me. And the
game will break, and I won’t be able to play it at all.” His father just shook his head.
It was his other son’s turn. He opened his package only to find a box of manure. He
jumped up and clapped his hands, ran around the room excited, and began to shout, “I got a
horse; I got a horse for Christmas.” I guess we can always believe.
There are many qualities and characteristics that God seeks to develop in His people.
Key among there are faith, hope and love. This is described in I Thessalonians 1:3 “We
remember before our God and Father your work produced by faith, your labor prompted by
love, and your endurance inspired by hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.”
Through this Christmas season we will be looking at these qualities as they are
experienced and learned by key characters in the first Christmas events.
The Biblical account of the Christmas story is full of practical examples of men and
women who lived by faith, and whose faith was challenged. Mary was given some pretty
difficult information to believe, but she acted upon it and it changed her life. The Magi had
some vague ancient prophecies, and they went on a two year journey just to honor that child
they believed had been born.
And so is the case with Joseph. We don’t know much about him. See him
mentioned 6 times in Matthew and 5 times in Luke. In those handful of places, he doesn’t say
a word. But we learn some important things about him.
Joseph is a man whose faith is tested.
He was a righteous Jew.
Matthew 1:19, “He was righteous” (NASB),
“Faithful to the Law,” (NIV).
This is important in order for us to understand his actions. It means that he wanted
to live as God directed him. That is a great quality for all of us to have.
He was engaged to Mary. Actually they were “betrothed,” which is more than
engagement, but less than marriage. It was probably an arranged marriage.
There was a ceremony to formalize this. Then for the next year there was still little or
no contact between the two. It was a time of waiting, seeking God, and preparing themselves
for marriage.
It was during this time that Mary had her experience with the angel and found herself
with child. As a young girl, maybe as young as 14, she was struggling with these events. She
found a way to communicate this to her husband to be. 
Imagine that discussion – “Joseph, I have not been with a man, but I am with child.”
“That is impossible would be his reply.” She would try to tell him about her vision of the angel,
all of the things he told her, it is God’s child she would try to explain. Joseph would be hurt
and angry and embarrassed.
Joseph most likely concluded that Mary had been unfaithful. According to Jewish law he
could not proceed with the marriage. But he was kind and considerate, and did not wish to
add to her shame. So he decided that he would end the betrothal quietly. This could only
be done through divorce proceedings. It was serious and official.
Joseph was also a man who listened to God. We are not told specifically that Joseph
prayed about this, or sought God, I believe that he did. That is what faithful people, what
righteous people do. They recognize that it is not primarily about what they want, it is what God
wants in their lives.
I picture Joseph on his knees before God, praying and weeping about what he is to
do in this situation. Finally he falls asleep. It is while he is sleeping that God speaks to him
through an angel, and Joseph understands.
Like all of the rest of us, Joseph and Mary made plans. But those plans fall through.
They made plans, but God had plans of His own.
Faith becomes an issue especially during challenging times. Life was turned
upside down for Joseph as these events unfolded. Of course this changed again when he
had his own visit from an angel. The angel explained that what Mary said was true, she was
with child through the Holy Spirit, this was part of God’s plan, and that he should marry to her.
Here is where his faith is really tested. This is an impossible event, yet “all things
are possible with God.” This would be very difficult to deal with, God doesn’t promise to make
our lives easy. Joseph needed to have “assurance and hope, and a conviction of God’s
goodness and promise, even when he could not see it!”
Faith is an essential part of our lives. Heb 11:6 (NIV) Without faith it is impossible to
please God....
Look at the examples found in Heb. 11
Noah faced an earth altering flood,
Abraham had to leave his home and his country,
Abraham offered up his son for sacrifice
Moses was called to lead his people to freedom
In every case, they were placed in challenging situations, where they couldn’t be sure of
the outcome, and asked to believe God, that is living by faith. 1 Pet 1:6-7 Trials happen, so
that your faith--of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire--
may be proved genuine and may result in praise, glory and honor...
How do we develop this ability to live by faith?
Know God – If you wish to live by godly faith, to be a person of faith, you begin by
coming to know the true God.
Consider Abraham, who was called by God out of Ur of the Chaldeans, before he had a
relationship with God. Based on God’s revelation to him Abraham left family and culture to
seek God’s promise to him. So it is possible for God to reach into the life of one who does
not know Him. 
Scripture explains how God has reached out to us, in order to provide a means by which
we can know Him, and have a relationship with Him.
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that
whosoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”
Rom. 10:9 “If you confess with your mouth “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your
heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.”
Ask Jesus to come into your heart. We don’t understand everything about salvation and a
relationship with Christ. But we can know God, and we can experience His peace, His purpose
and His presence in our lives. The more that we walk with God, this builds our relationship with
Him, and the more we can recognize His presence and His plan in our lives. Know God.
Second, listen for and to God. Joseph heard the angel speaking to him and recognized
him as a messenger from God. He might even have been seeking God as to how to handle
this difficult situation. On a constant basis, in good times and bad, seek God, desire to hear
what He says about how you should live and what you should be doing. We can do this through
reading the bible, and interacting with God through prayer, and receiving spiritual counsel.
The months immediately after I left as Senior Pastor of Elim Baptist Church in
Chicago, were a bit challenging for me. I was seeking God’s direction and His provision, but
I was unemployed, and not sure what was next for me. During this time I began to read the
book of Jeremiah in my personal devotions.
On the first day of that process I prayed to God, “I have felt You leading me to read this
book. I know that it was written thousands of years ago to a very different culture and set of
events, but God, speak to me through it, and apply it in my own life.” I began to read, 1:5
“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I
appointed you as a prophet to the nations.”
That spoke loudly to affirm my calling to pastoral ministry. Vs. 9 “Then the Lord
reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me, “Now, I have put my words
in your mouth.”
This was a clear affirmation of God saying, “I am here and I have things to say to you
and through you.” He can also speak to us through others, a pastor, a teacher, a friend. He
can speak through a song or events. I am convinced that God is speaking directly to each of us
daily, it is just a question of whether we hear Him.
To live by godly faith, it is essential to know God. We must then listen for and to
God & recognize His voice, and we need to believe what He tells us, but that is not all there
is. Faith is not complete until it results in action.
James helps us understand this issue in James 2:18 “But someone will say, “You
have faith; I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by
what I do.
So the final component to living by godly faith, we act upon how we know God
has directed.
Joseph then took Mary as his wife, and raised Jesus as his son. He was a part of the
most significant event in history. God wants each of us to get out of our comfort zone, take a
step of faith, place ourselves in a situation that only God can accomplish. Then we will see Him
work miracles. Because he lived by faith.
Joni Erickson Tada – “Faith isn’t the ability to believe long and far into the misty future.
It’s simply taking God at His Word and taking the next step.”
As we think of the Christmas story, we can identify many examples of faith, and
apply them in our lives as well.
God can change our plans. God’s plans always comes before our plans.
Know God
Listened for and to God
You may not understand it all, or at all, believe God
Act on God’s commands, live by faith
I would like to say, “the more you practice faith, the easier it becomes.” I don’t
think that is the case.
Faith is one of those components of life that doesn’t really become easier. I guess that
I can say, “the more that you practice faith, the more you will practice faith.
It is somewhat like a muscle, the more you exercise it, the stronger it becomes, and
the more that you can do with it. It is somewhat like a talent, the more you practice, the better
you are at it. It is somewhat like a character quality, the more you are intentional to act that
way, the more natural it becomes a part of you. For each of these, it may be true, that they
really don’t become easier, they become more a part of who you are. That is especially
true about living by faith. The more you do it, the more you will do it.
There is one final thing that we see here about how God is at work in Joseph’s life,
and in our world.
God tells Joseph the child’s name, and who He is. Vs. 21 “She will bear a Son; and
you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”
Jesus in Hebrew is Yeshua, related to Yahweh, one of the names of God, means,
Yahweh Saves.
Quotes Isaiah 7:14 “BEHOLD, THE VIRGIN SHALL BE WITH CHILD AND SHALL BEAR A SON,
AND THEY SHALL CALL HIS NAME IMMANUEL,” which translated means, “GOD WITH US.”
God wants us to recognize who Jesus is, our Savior, and a part of our lives.
How is God calling you to live by faith today? As you live your life on a daily basis,
as you face the ups and even the downs, seek God, listen to God, live by faith,
Know it is about the person and the name of Jesus, God saves, and He is our
Savior. It is about Emanuel, “God is with us.”
May God be with you.",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",12/7/2014,
"In biblical times, leprosy was a terrible problem. The word was often used to describe a
variety of skin diseases. It starts with a white patch of skin that becomes numb, so much so that
the victims cannot even feel a needle piercing the spot. The patch begins to spread all over the
body and often manifests itself on the face, so the disease is impossible to hide.
It then begins to form spongy tumors on the face and, at the same time, attacks the
internal organs as well. The nerve endings become numb so the victim cannot tell when
something is hurting him, like fire burning his hand. The leprosy itself was not fatal, but more
lepers died from other diseases they contracted because of their weakened condition.
There was a great fear of transmission of this disease through contact, so Lepers were
isolated from the community. Those infected have been placed in Leper Colonies for thousands
of years, and continues to take place today.
In our text the 10 Lepers cry out to Jesus from a distance which demonstrates this
isolation. They cried out to the Saviour for mercy. Jesus’ response was for them to go and see
the Priest. According to Leviticus 14, if a Leper were healed, the Priest would come to them
and determine if healing took place. Jesus sent them to the Priest because as they were on
their way, they were healed.
Along the way they saw that they were healed. We hear nothing more of the 9, but one
of them returns to Jesus, praises God and gives thanks. My question for you today is, are you
one of the nine, or are you one of the one?
All were in need
Physical pain, separated from people
We all have pain in our lives.
They all called on Jesus
Jesus is always the place to turn in time of need.
Jesus cared about them
Even when no one else did
Jesus cares about each one of us here.
They were all healed
Jesus is the one that provides health & hope.
Only one returned in gratitude
He recognized the difference that Jesus made
He glorified God & was thankful.
Do you give God the glory, and be thankful.
Are you one of the nine, or are you one of the one?
What happened to the nine?
· One waited to see if the cure was real.
· One waited to see if it would last.
· One said, ""I was already much improved.""
· One said he would see Jesus later.
· One decided that he had never had leprosy.
· One said he would have gotten well anyway.
· One gave the glory to the priests.
· One said, ""O, well, Jesus didn’t really do anything.""
· One said, ""Any rabbi could have done it.""
We don’t want to be one of the nine, they are people of excuses, who don’t appreciate
others or God’s presence in their lives. Be one of the one, who recognized God’s presence
and expressed his gratitude.
Count your blessings instead of your crosses;
Count your gains instead of your losses;
Count your joys instead of your woes;
Count your friends instead of your foes.
Count your smiles instead of your tears;
Count your courage instead of your fears.
Count your full years instead of your lean;
Count your kind deeds instead of your mean.
Count your health instead of your wealth;
Count on God instead of yourself.
Have an attitude of gratitude.
We need a correct perspective:
Matthew Henry, Bible Commentator
After he was robbed, wrote in diary,
“Let me be thankful.
First, because I was never robbed before.
Second, because although they took my wallet,
they did not take my life.
Third, because although they took my all,
it was not much.
Fourth, because it was I who was robbed, not I who robbed.”
We are reminded in God’s word to be thankful, and some of the significant blessings for
which we can give thanks.
Psalm 100
A psalm. For giving grateful praise.
1 Shout for joy to the LORD, all the earth.
2
 Worship the LORD with gladness;
 come before him with joyful songs.
3 Know that the LORD is God.
 It is he who made us, and we are his[a]
;
 we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.
4 Enter his gates with thanksgiving
 and his courts with praise;
 give thanks to him and praise his name.
5 For the LORD is good and his love endures forever;
 his faithfulness continues through all generations.
How can we demonstrate thankfulness?
Thank you
Kind words & tone
Kind actions to the object of gratitude
Or to others
Think of a way you can demonstrate gratitude
Be one of the one!
We are more mindful of this during the holiday season.
In just a few moments, opportunity to share what you are thankful for this morning.
Here is a little different perspective on Thankfulness
Be thankful for the lawn that needs mowing,
Windows that need cleaning and gutters that need fixing, because it means that you have a
home to care for.
Be thankful for weariness and aching muscles
Because it means that you are capable of working hard, and you have tasks to
accomplish.
Be thankful for the lady behind you in church that sings off key, because it means that
you can hear.
Be thankful for the clothes that fit a little snug, because it means that you have
enough to eat.
Be thankful for the taxes that you pay, because it means that you are employed.
Be thankful for the alarm that goes off in the early morning, because it means that you
are alive, and have a reason to get out of bed.
Be thankful for the discussions that you have, the challenges of parenthood and the
difficulties in relationships, because it means that you have people in your life that you care
about, and they probably care about you as well.
Be thankful all year around,
Be one of the one!
",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",11/23/2014,
"The reality is that we all need Jesus in our lives, and we all need more of Jesus in our lives.
But when we, as Bible believing Christians, think about “Who needs Jesus?” What
kind of people come to mind?
Don’t go to church, live immoral life styles, lie, steal, cheat, curse, do drugs
Described in Romans 1:29, “They are filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed
and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,
30 slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they
disobey their parents; 31 they have no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.”
These are the kinds of people who need Jesus. Am I right? Many of them don’t
know they need Him!
There are many in our world today, and I believe in churches who would claim,
“I’m happy, I am secure, I am confident, I am in control, I am successful, I am, you fill in the
blank, I don’t really need Jesus.”
Keep those issues in mind as we look at a conversation between a happy man and
Jesus.
Jesus is approached by a man, described as – Ruler – Luke 18:18 “certain ruler;” young
– Matt. 19:20 “young man;” wealthy – each – “he had great wealth.”
We know him as “the Rich, Young, Ruler.” He had it all - youth, money, position.
Isn’t that what the world tells us to strive after? I bet he was good looking, and knew
how to dress, was probably tall. All of the things the world tells us matters.
This man in our story has a lot going for him…But he is seeking more…
He comes to Jesus, with the right attitude.
He calls Him “Good teacher.” AMP. “You who are essentially and perfectly morally
good.”
Jesus is the source, the authority, the teacher, the one with the answers. And He has
the quality of character to indicate that you can trust Him.”
That is not easily found in our world today.
He came to Jesus with the correct question, “What must I do to inherit eternal
life?”
A lot of people today, either don’t think about Life after Death, or they believe, “I’m
no worse than anyone else, I’m better than most, so God will let me into heaven.” I’m happy, I
don’t need Jesus.
Friends, we need Jesus, and we need to think about where we will spend eternity. This
is true for everybody, it is true for those outside of the church, outside of any sense of a
personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
It is also true for those who are spiritual people, who are interested and concerned
about spiritual things. It is true for those who attend a Christian church on a regular basis.
It is true for those who are followers of Jesus Christ.
NOT, am I saved! But am I where and who God wants me to be? Am I serving Christ
and am I a part of His plan to the max in my life?
This young man was intelligent and aware, he came to the right person with his very
good question. Jesus is the right person to come to, if you are interested in eternal life.
Jesus’ response found in Matthew: “if you want to enter life, obey the
commandments.”
The Young Man asks, “Which ones?” As though that makes a difference.
Many want to manipulate the circumstances of life, in order to make them appear
better than they really are. He was trying to be legalistic and specific, to find a formula to be
right with God.
Jesus then lists, commands 5 - 9 of the 10 commandments. These are the aspects of
the 10 commandments which impact our relationships with others.
In the Matthew’s account Jesus includes Lev. 19:18 “Love your neighbor as
yourself.” I find it interesting that Jesus says nothing about how we connect with God, He
refers only to how we relate to others.
I believe that Jesus is saying, that how we relate to and treat others is an indicator of
where we are with God.
The young man claims to have kept all of these.
Jesus, “You still lack one thing.” Imagine the glee of this young man, just one more
thing that he must do, and he is guaranteed eternal life. How would you feel if that is what he
said to you?
“Only one thing I need you to do?”
The one thing for this young man was…“Sell everything you have and give to the
poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, then come, follow me.”
Jesus is not teaching that all Christians should sell all that they have. He is not teaching
that if we sell everything and give to the poor we then earn salvation. This was the example
that was needed in this man’s life.
This step, this one thing, will be different for different people. The question really is, “Is
there anything that is more important to you than your relationship with God?”
“When he heard this, he became very sad, because he was a man of great wealth.”
He wasn’t willing to give up what he had for what he really needed.
The Key here is, “Then come, follow me.” (vs. 22) Nothing can be more important in
our lives than our obeying and serving Jesus!
One thing ~ Obey & Follow Jesus.
Jesus makes an interesting statement in verses 24 and 25, “How hard it is for the
rich to enter the kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”
It has been suggested by some that “the eye of the needle” referred to a small gate
next to the main city gate in Jerusalem. When the main gate was closed at night, travelers
could enter only through the smaller gate, where the guard had more control.
It was kind of like the security scanners at the airport. Only one person at a time
could enter. This small gate wasn’t made for camels to enter, they were quite large. But, if all
of the luggage was removed, and possibly if the camel knelt down, and scooted on their
knees, it was possible, but not easy for them to enter.
The image of getting rid of ones worldly goods, and humbling oneself on their
knees, is a great picture of humbly coming to God.
The words for “needle” used in Matt and Mark are ones that clearly refer to the needle
used in sewing. In Luke’s version, the Physician Luke uses the word for the needle used by a
surgeon, a finer needle with an even smaller eye.
What seems clear here is an example of a Hyperbole – an extreme statement in order
to make a point. Jesus is painting a picture of a physical camel, attempting to enter into the
eye of an actual needle, obviously an impossible task.
“Who then can be saved?”
“What is impossible with men is possible with God.”
People pursue relationships, money, power, position or things, attempting to find
happiness. The more of those things they have, often, the less they consider God.
What do we learn from this encounter?
1. Worldly success cannot satisfy your deepest need. Make sure that you seek a
relationship with God.
2. There is room for only one God in your life. Nothing in life should get in the
way. We need Jesus…We need more of Jesus.
3. What is Impossible for us ~ God already did for us! He already provided the
way to eternal life. There is nothing we can do to earn it. To receive it as our
inheritance, all we must do is to become a part of God’s family by accepting
Jesus as our Savior & our brother, and God as our Father
A country song, “I love you this much” by Jimmy Wayne is about a young boy whose
father doesn’t show him the love that he desires, and isn’t really a part of his life.
During one of their brief interactions the boy spreads out his arms, and whispers,
“Daddy, I want you to know…I love you this much and I’m waiting on you to make up
your mind. Do you love me too?”
The son struggles with his father’s absence for years, then his father dies, the now
young adult son struggles with the lack of relationship with his father during the funeral.
The song goes on…
Half way through the service, looking at a statue of Jesus hanging on the cross,
the young man says:
""Forgive me, Father"" when he realized that he hadn't been unloved or alone all his life.
Jesus arms were stretched out, as far as they'd go, nailed to the cross, for the whole
world to know...
God says to him
“I love you this much and I’m waiting on you to make up your mind. Do you love
me too? How ever long it takes, I’m never giving up, no matter what, I love you
this much.”
I hope that you know this morning, that God loves you this much, and more!
Do you realize that you need Jesus in your life, every day! Do you love God this
much?
Is there anything that interferes with your love relationship with God?
Is there anything in your life that He would ask you to give up
As you consider the eternal implications, what is God saying to you…this One
thing you must do?
",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",11/16/2014,
"I was coming to end of my first interim. I had contact with a couple of churches, but
nothing came together. As I said farewell on my final Sunday, I didn’t know what would be
next, and I was unemployed. That is one of the challenges of interim ministry, there is no job
security. You really are trying to work yourself out of a job. At this particular time there was
nothing on the horizon.
That was Sunday, on Tuesday I received a phone call from a man in Milwaukee
Wisconsin. They were looking for an interim, and had received my name. We chatted on the
phone, set up a meeting for Saturday, the following Sunday I visited the church, and preached.
The next Tuesday they called and invited me to be their interim Pastor.
I was only out of work for one Sunday. It hasn’t always happened quite that quickly
since then. During this journey Christine and I have had to learn in very practical, and
sometimes dramatic ways, to put our trust in God, to live by faith.
We have another powerful passage to consider this morning, that bluntly asks “What
does it mean to live by Faith.
When is it in our lives that we need to have or experience faith?
Loss of job, broken relationships;
Financial hardship, illness, death
A multitude of challenges in everyday life. Faith is especially relevant when life is
tough.
Faith is defined as “confidence or trust in a person or a thing. It is belief in
something without concrete proof.”
“Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see.” Heb.
11:1 (NIV)
“The fundamental fact of existence is that this trust in God, this faith, is the firm
foundation under everything that makes life worth living. It’s our handle on what we can’t see.
The act of faith is what distinguished our ancestors, set them above the crowd.” (MSG)
Faith is deaf to doubt, dumb to discouragement, blind to impossibilities and
knows nothing but success in God.
Walking by faith means being prepared to trust where we are not permitted to see.
Faith allows God to do for us and with us what we could never do alone.
Abundant life, and experiencing God’s greatest blessings come only when we live
by faith.
In our passage today, Jesus is impressed by this man’s faith.
Located on the north shore of the Sea of Galilee, Capernaum was an important Roman
port where Herod Antipas built a Roman garrison, a military base.
Roman centurions, who were each responsible for 100 soldiers, were authorized to
keep the peace of Rome in their occupied territory. These centurions generally had Roman
slaves to carry out household tasks for them.
Among the many soldiers in the Roman occupation, there was a certain centurion
who had a favorite slave, who was paralyzed at his home, suffering great pain unto death.
On behalf of his slave, the centurion sends word to Jesus through the Jewish elders,
asking him to save the life of his slave.
Here is a man of power, authority, influence and wealth who realizes that he
cannot save his slave from death.
He is surrounded by Roman and Greek deities, and many mystery religions. Based
upon his position of authority, he would have access to the best that medicine had to offer. Yet
when it comes to the subject of life and death he seeks to place his trust in a Jewish Rabbi
named Jesus. Knowing the hatred often found between Jews and Gentiles, there should be
extra interest in the fact that this God-fearing Roman turns to the local Jewish elders for
help in approaching Jesus.
Jesus responds, not because of political pressure from the Jews, He doesn’t work that
way. Jesus is moved by compassion for those in need, and I believe by the faith
demonstrated by the Centurion, who would go through so much, and act on his faith.
In Luke’s account, Jesus doesn’t meet the Centurion, communication takes place
through third parties. First, some Jewish elders, leaders of some kind, secondly, through
some friends sent to convey his message.
Three things are clear about the Centurion.
First, He was a leader of men, and a man of courage and responsibility, but he was
also humble. He says “I am not worthy to have you come to my house.”
Secondly, he recognized Jesus as someone special. He had heard about His ministry,
teaching, directing people to God, His miracles, His healings. He knew that Jesus was the
place to turn in his time of extreme need.
He also understood authority. He received orders, he carried them out, he didn’t
question them. He gave orders, he expected them to be carried out. In the Roman army,
under the leadership of strong warriors, authoritarian dictators who grabbed power
through military force, if you didn’t do what you were told, you could easily lose your life.
The Centurion in this event, recognized that Jesus had authority over the physical world,
and had the ability to heal his beloved servant. He recognized that Jesus was the source of
that healing power. It wasn’t a formula or an action. All Jesus had to do was to say the words.
To accept the power and authority of Jesus, and to act on that knowledge, is a powerful
testimony of faith. Often others are said to be amazed at Jesus. This is the only place that
Jesus is said to be amazed.
(Luke 7:9 NIV) When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him, and turning to the
crowd following him, he said, ""I tell you, I have not found such great faith even in Israel.""
That is something special, to be able to amaze the creator of the universe. That is living by
faith.
This is when faith is really a factor in our lives. When life is really tough and the
outlook is bleak. When we have pursued every human and superhuman avenue of potential
solution.
When we have asked everyone, looked on every search engine, checked with every
specialist, when we have dug and poked and sought any possible solution, and there is
nowhere to turn.
When the difficulty seems too huge to face, when there are just too many factors for us
to overcome, then it truly is an issue of who has authority in our lives, We turn to God! We
step out in faith.
We claim God’s promises. Philippians 4:13 “I can do all things through Christ who
gives me strength.”
We seek God for direction. (Psalm 43:3 NIV) Send forth your light and your truth, let
them guide me; let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell.
To live by Faith is a question of who has authority in your life! Who do you trust?
Upon who do you depend? Who do you believe in? How does that direct your actions?
To face the unknown, or the difficult and continue to trust and believe in Jesus and to act
on that trust is to live by faith.
Who has authority in your life?
Does Jesus provide your values & principles?
Does Jesus dictate your daily actions, your purpose, the direction of your life?
Do you find the “peace that passes understanding” in spite of the circumstances
and challenges of life?
To trust God, and do what He says, even when it isn’t easy, when it is not comfortable,
and even when it doesn’t seem to make sense. This is living by faith.
When God says, “Love your enemies & those who persecute you.” “Turn the other
cheek.” “Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church.” “Whoever forces you to go
one mile, go with him two.” “Meditate on God’s word day and night. And obey all that God says
to do.”
These are not always easy, nor do they always make sense to us. By faith, we act on
them anyway.
Be prepared to move out of your comfort zone, do what you have never done before,
attempt what seems impossible in response to God’s call and direction in your life.
Know that God is the place to turn. Have no question in your mind that His plan, His
principles, His values, His way is not only the best way to go, it is the only way to go.
Step out in faith.
A few years ago, Christine and I were suffering for the Lord in Branson MO at a
Pastor’s & Wives conference with Gary Smalley. We stopped at a Ticket Office to find out what
shows were playing.
The first step of faith, was that I went in.
I prefer that my wife interacts with people.
I asked for a schedule, the woman behind the counter asked me if I was just coming
into town I said we were at a marriage conference.
The woman was excited, “the Gary Smalley Conference at the Mel Tillis theater?”
Yes. She proceeded to tell me, “separated from her husband, tried to call a friend, got a
wrong number, the Smalley Relationship Center.”
We had just been told that couples who come to their intensive program, most have
already begun divorce proceedings, 90% success rate, to keep the marriages together.
I said to Dee, “how does it feel to be a part of a true miracle of God?”
The other woman, Sally, laughed, as if to say “sure, like God would do anything.”
I looked at Sally and said, “Don’t you dare laugh at God. Dee could have called an
infinite number of wrong numbers, she called the one that would be of the most help to her
in the area of greatest need in her life. You surely don’t think that is coincidence.”
God gave me a miraculous boldness, and wisdom to say the right thing. I asked Dee if
she and her husband were working with the Smalley people. She said that she had the
material, and they were considering going.
“Obviously God wants your marriage to work, and He will be a part of that.”
What is God doing in your life?
Who has authority in your life?
Are you living in obedience to Him & His word? Do you take the opportunity to share
your faith in Christ with someone; make some significant change in your life style; serve Him in
some specific way at church, or elsewhere; accomplish His perfect will, using you as His
instrument?
Needs here at EFCB: navigating this season of life; who are we as a church? Why are
we here? Can we be more effective in ministering to people?
How do we make this a church where people want to be, and that God can use to
impact lives?
Let’s not be hindered by the unknown.
Let’s know that God has a plan, a purpose, and the power. Let’s make sure that
He has the authority.
And let us move forward in faith.",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",11/9/2014,
"A season-ticket holder with the Baltimore Ravens, thought taking his seven-year-old
daughter to a game would be a good bonding experience. But once there, she found the food
vendors much more enticing than what was taking place on the field, so he bought her one
kind of junk food after another.
As the fourth quarter began, the Ravens were far behind, and much of the crowd had
already left. One seat down, though, sat another season-ticket holder. “I’m surprised you’re still
here,” the father said to him during a timeout.
“I can’t bear to leave yet,” the fan replied. “I’ve got to see just how much one little girl
can eat.”
Have you ever been really hungry? Doing a project, or running errands, or traveling, and
all of a sudden you realize that it is well past meal time? And you are well past getting
hungry! If you are traveling you might realize that it’s time to stop for lunch, but there is no place
convenient. One of my pet peeves is that you are driving along the highway, you see a sign for
a certain restaurant, usually McDonald’s or Wendy’s, but you get to the exit, and you cannot see
the place, it might be miles in one direction or the other. Our policy is that if you can’t see it,
you don’t get off.
Being in anticipation of the next meal, is the catalyst in our scripture event today. We
have been on a Journey with Jesus, we have been looking at the lives of individuals as they
intersect with the ministry of Jesus, and they were transformed, …never the same again.
In John 6:1-15 we find John’s account of the “Feeding of the 5,000.” It is one of the
few events in the life of Jesus that is found in all 4 of the gospels. And the only miracle that is
identified in every gospel, there is a reason for this.
God wants us to understand and apply His truth.
We know that this has been a difficult week for Jesus. By looking at Matthew 14 we see
that his cousin and ministry colleague, John the Baptist, was killed. Jesus actually had been
trying to find isolation from the crowds, and to grieve, but they tracked him down. It had
been a long day of traveling, teaching, and healing, it comes time to eat, and Jesus, always
concerned for the needs of others, so He asks His team about meal plans.
Depending on your outlook on life, this was a problem, a challenge or an
opportunity.
The primary goal for ministry usually isn’t large numbers, but we generally are pleased
when many people respond. If a church, or a ministry, is growing quickly, or touching many
lives, we believe that God is doing a work. If we plan an event, we hope that lots of people will
attend.....up to a point. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. Seating space, child
care, parking and resources can be taxed if there are too many people.
The Disciples found themselves out on a mountainside along with Jesus and a few of
their closest friends. A few… well…The text tells us 5,000 men, along with women and
children. If you add one woman for every man, in most church events there would be more
women, and a couple of children for each couple, you are easily up to 15 to 20,0000 people,
…and it was dinner time! What solutions were considered?
In Matt. 14:15 the Disciples took a very human approach, they came together and
concluded, the problem is too great, we can’t do anything for all these people. It’s the
wrong place, the wrong time, let someone else do it. It’s not our problem. Their solution,
according to Matthew’s account, “Send them away.” Not very creative.
This is the committee conclusion. Someone said that a committee is a “group of people
who individually can do nothing, but they come together and corporately decide that nothing
can be done.” ""A committee is a group of people who keep minutes and waste hours."" Not at
this church.
When you get a group of people together there are always those who will point out the
potential problems in any solution that you might suggest. Too often in the church we allow
those difficulties, and those who like to focus on the negative, to control what we do or do not
attempt. Some will declare “we’ve never done it that way before.” “It cannot be done.”
In our own lives as well, there are always challenges, do you see the glass as half full or
half empty? Some have trouble finding their glass. The difficulties that you face, are they
dead ends that stop you in your tracks, or are they opportunities to demonstrate the power of
God in your life? No matter how overwhelming or challenging a situation, don’t forget, our God
is the God of the impossible.
Potential Solution #2, Jesus asks Philip (John 6:5-7)
Jesus might have turned to Philip because he was from around that area. If anyone
would know where the human resources were, necessary to solve this problem, it would be
him. The text tells us that “Jesus did this to test him.” When Jesus tests us, they are to help
us learn and mature.
Jesus asks, “Where shall we buy bread for these people to eat?” Philip gets out his
calculator and estimates the cost.
“8 months wages would not buy enough bread for each one to even have a bite.”
3/4 of a year’s salary would not even be enough. This was not the question that Jesus asked of
Philip. Jesus asked where, not how. But Philip was focused on the physical, not the spiritual
conditions. What good is it to find the where, if there is no money to buy the what?
Again, this seems to make sense from a human standpoint. The problem is that in the
church, and in the lives of Christians, we are in God’s arena, not ours. We too often ask the
wrong questions, or attempt to answer the wrong question. I’m not suggesting that we don’t try
to use good sense in the church, but don’t let what makes sense from a human perspective
interfere with God’s agenda. It is often necessary in our lives to step out in faith. We
should all do that more often.
It is hard to live by faith. We think, if only we had more money, better facilities, more
people, more gifts, more resources of some type, only THEN we can do what God wants us
to do.
Faith means we seek and trust God, when we don’t have the answer, maybe aren’t
even sure of the question. We need faith when the situation is challenging, when we aren’t
sure what to do, and we must move out of our comfort zone.
Solution #3. At least one person is coming up with some kind of productive solution.
Andrew brings a little boy. Every time we see Andrew he is bringing people to Jesus. God
uses willing people. I believe that God is more interested in willing servants, than any other
resources. Andrew was willing, and the boy was willing. 
Except, look at those 3 little letters (vs. 9), “BUT what good are 5 loaves and 2 fish
for so many people?” No matter what the potential solution, there can always be a - but, the
reason that solution may not work. It may seem difficult, even impossible.
But keep in mind, “all things are possible with God.”
This was a challenge for the boy, it was his lunch, should he share? He was just a kid; it
was just a little bit. We often think, there must be someone else, I can’t do it. Our resources
and abilities often seem too small for the task. Little is much when God is in it, God is looking
for willing people.
If we forget this in our lives, we might easily bemoan the challenges and problems in our
lives, because they seem too great to overcome, then we may miss opportunities to serve
God’s agenda and to be a part of His miraculous work.
Let God into the difficult areas of your life, let God be the solution. He may do a
miracle!
Solution # 4, Jesus is the REAL Solution
Jesus is the one who ultimately solves the problem; he is the one that helps us make the
most of our opportunities.
When we give ourselves and our resources over to Jesus, He uses our little bits,
and our willingness in such a way that we are stretched, we must break out of our boxes
and we must leave our comfort zones.
He does it in such a way that God is glorified. He took that meager offering, it was all
the boy had. As far as we can tell, there was not another person in that huge crowd who was
offering anything. Jesus blessed it, gave it over to God, and a miracle happened.
The bread and fish were passed out. Remember, 5 loaves, 2 fish, 15 to 20
THOUSAND people. There was enough for all. I think this was the first all church pot luck.
There is always plenty of food. The crowd ate their fill, AND they gathered 12 baskets of
leftovers. It truly was a miracle meal.
What we see here is “The mathematics of a miracle.” Start with an overwhelming
task, (or any task for that matter), add a willing servant, plus a small amount of resources,
multiply those factors by the presence of Christ and they equal one mighty miracle. We
CAN experience God’s miracles in our lives, if we allow Him to work.
When is the last time you experienced this?
There are needs all around us:
Spiritual, people need to hear about Jesus.
Physical, hungry, homeless, abused, hurting.
Health, cancer, aging, all sorts of problems, small and large.
Broken families, moral decay.
They are overwhelming.
We might be tempted to say “send them away.” “What can we do against such a huge
task?” It’s not our job, it’s not our area of giftedness. It’s too big, we don’t have enough of
something, or of anything. 
Here is what we learn
1. Be willing to be used by God.
2. Give what you have to Jesus.
Sacrificially, cheerfully. Be excited to be a part of His work.
The boy offered his little lunch to the Master, look what happened.
3. Step out in faith.
Think and plan, but don’t let that get in the way of following God, and allowing God to
work miracles.
4. Do things God’s way.
God ALWAYS has a solution, be a part of His solution, consistent with God’s
values, principles and commands, you will probably be a part of God’s miracle.
When the Baptist General Conference was planning their Annual Meeting at Bethel
University back in the early 90’s, they wanted to get more young couples, pastors and lay
families to attend. So they ramped up the programming and lowered the cost for the kids
program. My wife Christine volunteered to be in charge of the food.
This was on a College Campus, where, because of the contract with their food service
provider, no one had access to the kitchens. And the 3rd week of June that summer was one
of the hottest on record, every day being above 90 degrees. Christine put together a team,
planned creative food, most importantly organized people to pray during the week.
They ended up with more than twice the elementary
and Jr. High kids that they usually had, reaching almost 250 kids. Where to put them, and what
to feed them were significant challenges.
Of course Christine provided a very successful menu, under challenging
circumstances. But it was almost too much of a good thing. It could have been a Problem…
Some would have seen it as a Challenge… but it turned out to be as Opportunity for God to be
glorified, and lives to be touched.
What is in your lunch basket? What have you packed away, with plans to use it for
something, but Jesus has other plans? Are you bringing your small resources and making
them available to God’s use?
Don’t wait for the opportunity to do something great for the Lord, be willing daily to do
something for Jesus.
“Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according
to his power that is at work within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all
generations forever and ever.” – Ephesians 3:20-21 (NIV)",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",11/2/2014,
"One Sunday, in a previous church, we had a child dedication service. At the end of the
service a woman came up to speak with me. She had committed her life to Christ, and been
baptized as a teenager. At some point after that, she stopped going to church, wasn’t interested in
things of the Lord, and began to live a worldly and immoral life. She had 5 children, with multiple
fathers. She was currently living with the man who was father to her youngest child.
A few months before this particular Sunday, she had come back to church with her children.
She approached me after the service to comment that none of her children had ever been
dedicated, and to ask whether I could do that for her. I thought to myself, we don’t dedicate
children to parents who aren’t married…. I can’t help but to think about this young woman when I
consider our text for today.
We tend to struggle in the church, and in our individual lives, when we come across people
who are quite different than ourselves. People who look different, who act differently, those with
different life styles, the ones with a different view of morality, people who think, who believe and
who act differently than we do. Many of us struggle with how to relate to them.
We see one such encounter in our text today. Let’s walk and talk our way through this
narrative.
Found in John 4, PRAY
Jesus left Judea and headed back to Galilee. The most direct road took Him through Samaria.
Most religious Jews would have traveled around Samaria to avoid contact with its residents.
Jews and Samaritans didn’t care much for one another. At the time of the captivity of Israel in the 6th
century BC, many Jews were deported, but not all of them. 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles and Ezra.
Some who remained, intermarried with gentiles who were brought into the country. Most
Jews believed that to marry a non-Jew was blasphemy. The Samaritans were the descendants of
these people. Generally Jewish people tried to avoid them whenever possible.
Ethnic mixing is often a controversial subject.
Jesus had a different view. John 4:4 says, “Now he had to go through Samaria.” He was
compelled to go through Samaria, because this was God’s purpose. Jesus was always guided
by God’s agenda.
Later on Jesus says to His disciples 4:34 My food, is to do the will of him who sent me and
to finish his work.” He made this trip seeking God’s plan.
On this day, God had a plan for an unnamed, woman from the city of Sychar, who had
made many poor choices and led a sinful life. But God loved her, and Jesus came in order to
make a difference in her life.
God loves all of the lost people of the world, He loves those who chose lives of
immorality and lives to be lived far from a relationship with Him. He loves those people.
Jesus is hanging out at a well. One of the significant characteristics of Jesus’ ministry is
that He meets people where they are. He meets them on their turf, and where they are at
emotionally and spiritually. Today I think you would find Jesus at Dunn Brothers or the Mall.
Jesus had 132 contacts with people in the gospels. Six were in the Temple, four in the
synagogues. All the others were out in life situations. There is a lesson here for us today. Don’t
expect those far from God to look like you and I, or only to come into our world.
We don’t come to church, we are the church. We are salt and light, and can impact the
world only as we engage with the world. 
From a human perspective, we can understand why Jesus might have avoided contact with
this particular person. To begin with, she is a woman. In Jewish society, in the first century, it was
not acceptable for men, especially a Rabbi, to speak or interact with women, It just wasn’t done!
They were racially different; this is one of the strongest forms of prejudice & division in the
world. It was particularly strong between Jews and Samaritans.
And she was a woman who lived a very immoral life. Her priorities, choices, life style and
morality were far different than those of Jesus. She wasn’t even accepted by many of the people
in her own community.
She came out to draw water from the well, in the middle of the day. Most women would
come early in the morning, then again in the evening, times when it was cooler. It appears that she
is trying to avoid the jeers and taunts and hatred of others, by coming when she wouldn’t have to
confront others.
Jesus begins with what seems like small talk. But when you are speaking to Jesus, it is
always significant! He asks her about water.
The most significant component of life on earth is oxygen. Oxygen is found in abundance
and easily accessible. The second most important component is water. About 60% of our body is
water, up to 75%.
Water is essential to our existence. It is also found in abundance, it covers 71% of the
Earth’s surface. Only 2.5% of this abundance is freshwater, 98% of the freshwater is frozen or
underground. So water is not generally easy to acquire.
Jesus asks her for a drink, an apparently simple request. This woman even recognizes how
unusually it is. “How can you ask me for a drink? You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman.”
(vs. 9)
Jesus quickly raises the stakes, “If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you
for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."" (10)
This is a powerful and significant declaration from Jesus. Today, I want you to identify with
the Samaritan woman, so Jesus is speaking to you.
“If you knew the gift of God,” Do you recognize how God is active in your life, and the many
gifts that He offers to you on a daily basis?
“If you knew who I am,” Do you know Jesus? Yes, have you accepted Jesus as your Savior
and the Lord of your life, but it goes beyond that. Do you walk closely with Him on a daily basis, and
see how your life is transformed daily? “You would have asked Him for living water.” Is your life
and sustenance found in Him? Do you find your energy and purpose in following Christ?
In the same way that Nicodemus last week had trouble distinguishing the physical from the
spiritual, so does this woman. “Sir, you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep.”
Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, 14 but whoever drinks
the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of
water welling up to eternal life.”
The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and have to keep
coming here to draw water.” She does not understand as of yet, the implications of Jesus’ words, Let
not you and I make that same mistake. Even though water is essential for life on earth, and much
of her time and effort was expended to have sufficient water on a daily basis, Jesus was speaking of
something far greater.
Jesus is speaking about abundant life here and eternal life to come. He is speaking of the
daily refreshment that comes from walking with Jesus who given us answers and direction and 
comfort and encouragement when we need it the most. It is this relationship that truly gives our
lives meaning.
Jesus then speaks of her moral condition. Consider, last week Jesus interacted with….
Nicodemus, one on the extreme positive side of the spiritual spectrum. This week, His conversation
is with one on the other end of that position in life. Whoever we are, wherever we/you might be
spiritually, you need Jesus! And we all need more of Jesus!
She had been with many men. There were five who can be called her husbands. Jesus
knows, because He knows all, that the man she is now with is not her husband.
She is not the poster child for positive relationships.
In some circles such a life style is common today, and becoming more common all of the
time. Christians continue to struggle with divorce and multiple marriages, cohabitation, as well as
worldly and alternate lifestyles. It is true that God hates divorce and immoral living conditions.
But God loves people who make mistakes, and we all make mistakes. We can’t expect
unsaved people to live according to God’s morality. We can’t expect people to clean up their life
style, before they come to Christ. Christ followers must figure a way to engage those whose
choices and life styles are far from God, and be able to share God’s love and the truth of the
gospel with them.
Jesus concludes this encounter with one of the great missionary and evangelistic statements
in scripture, “Don’t put it off, open your eyes and look at the fields! They are ripe with harvest.”
There is work to be done, go out and do it.
To highlight this statement, Jesus had been talking with this woman, she went to tell others,
and here they come to find Jesus and in vs. 41 “And because of his words, many more became
believers.” Interaction with Jesus transforms lives.
Surprising Insights from the Unchurched and Proven Ways to Reach Them. Thom
Rainer, published in 2008:
Our team of 17 has covered all 50 states and Canada listening to the unchurched. We have
been among a diversity of ethnic groups and socioeconomic groups. We have been in
wide-ranging demographic areas, and we have talked to as many females as males. We have
listened to the unchurched with modest education, and we listened to the unchurched with
doctoral degrees. We have indeed listened for thousands of hours. Here are some of the
things that they found.
? Most of the nonchurched feel guilty about not attending.
? 8 out of 10 have a positive view of Pastors
? The Majority of unchurched would like to have a relationship with a Christian.
? 9 out of 10, would visit church, if they were invited.
? 160 million unchurched in the US
? 144 million would visit if invited
Sometimes today, within churches and “church people,” we may be uncomfortable with those
who have life styles, and have made choices that are not godly. The religious leaders of the first
century often criticized Jesus for spending time with the wrong kinds of people. His response to them
in Matthew 9:12, 13 is “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick….For I have not
come to call the righteous, but sinners.”
What difference does Efree Bemidji make to the non-Christians in our community? Is this
a place that they can find hope, love, and acceptance? Is this a place where they can find Jesus?
Some will identify with the Samaritan Woman. You know that you are not living consistent with 
God’s truth. You feel far from God. God is reaching out to you! Some of us need to become
more Christlike in relationship to those outside of a relationship with God.
Let us review what we have seen here:
1. Jesus pursued God’s purpose. He traveled a path that others would not have taken,
spoke to a woman that other’s would have ignored, forgot about His own physical
comforts in order to be available for God.
2. Jesus broke down barriers. Ethnic, racial, gender, economic, life-style, even moral
condition, He connected where people were, physically and spiritually. That is
what we should need to see in God’s church.
3. Jesus was sensitive to the person to whom He ministered. He reached out with
love that was patient and caring. We can’t expect people who are not controlled by
God, to live by God’s standards.
4. Jesus pointed people to God. He intentionally brought the conversation around to
talking about spiritual things, and telling them that they need God. That truly is what
it is all about!
Let me give you the rest of the story about the young lady that I started with today. I went to
visit her with the intention of explaining why I could not dedicate her children. As I spoke with
her I found that she was sincere in her recommitment to follow Jesus.
Being a mother of 5 children, she could not support herself, and her family wouldn’t help.
So she was stuck with her live in boyfriend. But she did want to commit herself to raising her children
to know and love Jesus. And it struck me that I have never dedicated children to perfect parents.
Based on this, I determined that I should dedicate her and her children. I explained that her
boyfriend could not participate, since he wasn’t a Christian. She figured that he would not be
interested, or even wish to attend.
I did discuss this with the Deacons, and they agreed with my conclusions, that we should do
this. And they understood that the church had increased responsibility to support her in this task.
The day of the dedication service, the boyfriend did attend the serviced. Matter of fact, he
began to attend church every Sunday. After a couple of months, much prayer, and discussions
with others in the church, he accepted Jesus as His personal savior.
I baptized him, and about 6 months later they got married. They have stayed a part of that
church, and today he is one of the leaders in the church.
Pursue God’s purpose in your life, seek out the Samaritan woman that God would have
you deal with. Don’t be stopped by barriers, racial, dress, looks, or life style.
Be sensitive to their needs.
Point them to a right relationship with God. Make sure that this church is a refuge for the
hurting and those who need more of God in their lives. And know that the fields are ripe with
harvest, be one who seeks to harvest.",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",10/26/2014,
"How many here today “Know Jesus?”
How many here today are “best friends with Jesus?”
We are best friends with someone when our lives are intertwined with one another, when we are
engaged in a meaningful way with them, and they with us. And our lives are different, we are
improved, and in many ways completed because they are in our lives. Does that describe you and
Jesus?
We are beginning a Sermon Series entitled “Meeting Jesus.” We will see individuals who
meet Jesus and their lives are transformed, they move to become more the men and women that
God intended them to be. They move to become more like Jesus.
A common theme in this series will be, how are you like this person who meets Jesus?
Today we will take a look at a very familiar passage of scripture, and see what happens in the life of
Nicodemus. Here is what I want you to get out of my sermon today…I want you to be Nicodemus.
Listen closely and consider where you see yourself in this interaction.
John 3:1-15 Nicodemus was looking for something. He came to Jesus, seeking something
important, and he found it. We see 3 things in this passage…
I. Nicodemus takes the Initiative
The text describes him as, “a Pharisee & a member of the Jewish ruling counsel.” Vs. 1.
According to Jewish law, there could be no more than 6,000 Pharisees in Israel. They were the
religious scholars, the men who spent their time pouring over the ancient writings, interpreting them and
applying them to their own day. They were a self-righteous bunch, known for splitting hairs and
being sticklers
for details. They believed that they only had the truth of God. You had to follow their rules to the
letter or else you failed.
Nicodemus was no ordinary Pharisee. He was also a “ruler of the Jews.” This means that he
was one of the Sanhedrin. There were 70 men who made up this ruling body, kind of a Supreme
Court, dealing with both civil and religious affairs for Israel. This was a position of great prestige
and power.
He is one of 6,000, he is one of 70, and look at vs. 10. In the Greek there is a definite article
before “Israel’s teacher.” It is translated in the English Standard Version, “are you THE teacher of
Israel, and do not understand these things?”
He is the head guy, the top scholar.
He was the Andy Stanley or David Jerimiah of his day.
You see it doesn’t make any difference how much education we have, or how religious we think
we are, how much bible knowledge we have, or our ability to teach or to lead.
We still must come seeking Jesus. We must be open to His revelation and His presence in
our lives.
Nicodemus….a Pharisee, comes to see Jesus.
You need to be Nicodemus this morning. 
I think that he came to Jesus at night because he was seeking a quiet uninterrupted
conversation with this teacher “come from God.”
He appears to be a man seeking after God’s truth.
And it is reality, that when seeking God, you go through Jesus.
It struck me, as I was thinking about this interaction, that these are probably the most used
verses for the purpose of evangelism that we have in the bible. John 3:16 is the best known and
most memorized verse in scripture. Men and women around the world have met Jesus for the very
first time by considering this exchange between Nicodemus and Christ.
Nicodemus this highly educated spiritual leader, humanly powerful man, recognized his need,
was seeking God’s truth, and came seeking Jesus. Every one of us, no matter our education, our
position, our finances or our role in the church, need to come humbly, seeking more of Jesus in our
lives.
II. Jesus’ Discernment
Nicodemus greeted Jesus with recognition that He was someone special. He calls Him Rabbi,
this means teacher, it was a term of respect. He went on to declare his position. It was not only his
position, he says, “We know you are a teacher who has come from God.” Notice the plural. I
believe that Nicodemus came representing a group within the Pharisees that thought as he did, who
saw Jesus as someone special.
Jesus quickly cuts through the small talk and gets to the point. Jesus gives us in one sentence
the ultimate importance to the person seeking spiritual knowledge, or spiritual peace in their lives.
You need to listen, this might be for you. Jesus describes how you become right with God. John
3:3 “I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.”
In the Greek, this has a double meaning, it is a play on words. It means “to give birth a second
time,” it also means “to be born from above.” So Jesus is addressing the most significant issue in
life, and going directly to Nicodemus’s primary need. And He is letting Nicodemus know that something
new needs to happen in his life. And this new work comes from God.
You need to be born again,
You need to be born from above.
In vs. 5 what is it that Jesus means by “unless one is born of water and the Spirit”? Here is
a couple of observations that I think helps to better understand his meaning.
In this verse there is a preposition in the Greek, EK which means “out,” this generally is not
translated. So the phrase could be translated, “no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is
born out of water and spirit.
Then, there is a parallel between vss. 5 & 6. In vs. 5 one must “be born out of water and
spirit.” Then vs. 6, “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”
That would connect water to flesh or the physical, and spirit to ….spiritual.
I don’t think that Jesus is referring here to water baptism. I think Jesus is making a distinction
between the physical and the spiritual, and that the water in this context is the amniotic fluid that is a
part of a physical birth. You need to be born again, physically and spiritually.
I believe that Jesus is saying to Nicodemus, “you need to respond to what God is doing, you
will only enter the kingdom of God, become a part of what God is doing, if you recognize your
need for God, confess and repent your sinfulness, and turn to God. This is both a spiritual and a
physical process. That it is not just head knowledge, Nicodemus had that, it is also a change of
heart, and action.
Jesus is not asking N. to understand, He is not asking for it to be placed in his Pharisaical
grid and see how this matches up with a life-time of work and study, and centuries of tradition in
order to understand how this fits with his well thought out meticulous theology. Just believe, and act
on it.
Nicodemus struggles with separating the physical from the spiritual. “How can a man be born
when he is old? Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother’s womb to be born!” vs.4
This is not a struggle with the logistics of going through a physical birth for a second time.
Nicodemus is saying that he has lived a long time, he has believed and acted on his
understanding of God for many years. How can he change now? How can he start over? How can he
start doing life differently?
Jesus says, “you have been a student of God’s word, and a spiritual leader of Israel, you are the
top theological mind alive today, and you still do not understand how God works, and what it is that
God wants in your life.
What is the point of today’s sermon?
“Each one of us need to be Nicodemus. So what would Jesus being saying to you today?
What would you be struggling with when Jesus said “you must be born again? You must start over,
you must make changes?”
We need to have a change of heart. We need to be able to give up our human traditions and our
personal preferences. We are to be made new in Christ, and to become like Jesus.
The future cannot look like the past.
But change comes hard. We like what we are used to experiencing. We see how we have
been effective in the past, so why make a change now? These are the things that we have been
taught, and how we understand them to be applied in our lives and in the world, how can we change?
This means that no matter how long you have been a Christ Follower, no matter how much
you know and understand of God’s word, no matter what positions that you have held in the church
or in Kingdom ministry, and no matter how effective and influential you have been in ministry, God
is not finished with you.
You must be born again! Day by day there needs to be a rebirth to a new presence of the person
and power of God, a fresh outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a renewed understanding….of what it
means to be like Jesus.
III. Nicodemus’s Transformation
We are not specifically told here what effect Jesus’ words had on Nicodemus, the story just
kind of ends. But we see him 2 more times in this gospel, they suggest that Jesus had a profound
effect on him. John 7:50-52. The chief priests and Pharisees were debating what to do about Jesus.
Nicodemus stood up before this group, it might have been the Sanhedrin, and he spoke up for Jesus.
He encouraged them to hear Jesus out. To listen to what He has to say. That is how we need
to encourage people today. Many have real misconceptions of who Jesus is, and for what He stands,
they need to hear Him out.
Even more dramatically in John 19:38 & 39 following Jesus’ crucifixion. Nicodemus made it
clear where he stood.
He and Joseph of Arimathea who risked the wrath of the group that wanted Jesus dead, in
order to take care of His body, and prepare the way for the great miracle of the resurrection.
A learned man, a religious leader, one who lived a life-time of knowledge and experience, came
seeking truth, and found the one who said “I am the way the truth and the life, no man comes to the 
Father but through me.” John 14:6
Intimate interaction with Jesus transforms our lives.
We need to come to Jesus as Nicodemus did, and seek the truth. We come by faith, believing
that Jesus has the truth.
Don’t let your own religious traditions, personal preferences, or unanswered questions get in
the way. Don’t let your knowledge, intellect and apparent spiritual maturity stop you.
Listen to what Jesus has to say, and let it change your life.
Billy Graham was once attending a dinner in his honor & found himself seated by an
archbishop of a dominant religion in another country. During the evening Dr. Graham asked this man
how he had become a Christian. This is the story told:
He had already been installed as the archbishop in his country when he was invited to Chicago
to give a lecture in a prominent theological school. One afternoon while sightseeing, he boarded a
city bus.
No sooner had he taken his seat when a big black finger tapped him on the shoulder. He turned
to look into the full, round, ebony face of an obviously poor woman seated behind him. In a wonderfully
rich voice, she asked, “Mister, has you ever been born again?” He frowned, thinking for sure he had
misunderstood her question since English was his second language. With polite reserve he asked,
“Excuse me?”
The deep, rolling voice repeated, “I says, has you been born again?” The archbishop
stiffened his back, straightened his shoulders, and replied with the greatest dignity, “My dear madam, I
am the archbishop of the church in my country I am here to give a lecture at the theological
seminary.” And he turned away from her.
As the bus rolled to a stop, the woman rose to get off. She looked at the proud, religious man
dressed in his flowing robes bearing the insignia of his office & said bluntly, “Mister, that ain’t what I
asked you. I asked you, ‘Has you been born again?” Then she turned and walked off the bus and out
of his life.
But, the archbishop said, her words rang in his ears and burned in his soul. He went back to
his hotel room, located a Gideon Bible in a dresser drawer, opened it to the Gospel of John, and read
the familiar story of Nicodemus. With increasing clarity & conviction, he knew that even w/ all of his
religious training & devotion & service & recognition, he had never been born again.
So he slipped down on his knees, & that night, in a Chicago hotel room thousands of miles
from his home, God answered his heart’s cry, and he came face to face w/Jesus for the very first
time.
Have you been born again?
Being right with God is not about religion, it is about relationship. It is about responding to
God’s love for us, to begin, and to daily give highest priority to growing in our love relationship
with God. To reorienting ourselves on a regular basis to come to God with child like faith, believing,
and knowing that we have everything to learn. And to regularly throughout the day, to seek to be
cleansed from our sin, and reconnect with God with all of our heart, mind and spirit.
And to never be finished allowing God to transform our perspective, our understanding and our
lives, as we are born again and again and again.",Peter Kolb,"Bemidji, MN",10/19/2014,
"Each time our church observes communion, we put an announcement in the bulletin a week
beforehand. It reminds each of us to take some time to reflect upon our walk with the Lord and our
relationships with other Christians. It’s based on the instructions given in 1 Corinthians 11:28, ""We
ought to examine ourselves before we eat of the bread and drink of the cup.""
Today, my message will focus on our union with Christ. It’s based on this proposition: “To be a
Christian means that we are in a love relationship with God.”
And the message today invites each of us to consider this
question: How are things between God and me lately?
In Revelation 2 we find a letter to the Church in Ephesus: This is the first of the Apostle John’s
seven letters to the churches in Asia Minor. In Rev. 2:2-3, John says “I know your deeds, your hard
work and your perseverance. I know that you cannot tolerate wicked people, that you have tested
those who claim to be apostles but are not, and have found them false. 3 You have persevered and
have endured hardships for my name, and have not grown weary.”
John begins with words of commendation. He says you have good deeds and you are working
hard for God. You have good beliefs and you are guarding the biblical truths. And, you are hanging in
there with perseverance. Sounds pretty good. ;)
>> Way to be church in Ephesus!

Then, John goes on in Rev. 2:4-5a to bring one item of rebuke, “Yet I hold this against you:
You have forsaken the love you had at first. 5 Consider how far you have fallen! Repent and do the
things you did at first…” We don’t know the specific things that John had in mind when he wrote to the
church in Ephesus. But we do know that his words to the Christians living in Ephesus at that time
reveal something about our faith. Our faith has to be lived out through more than just good beliefs and
good works. John rebukes them: “consider how far you have fallen!” He even goes so far as to call
them to repentance: to change their minds and attitudes about how they are living out their faith.
And then he says, “do the things you did at first.” But we don’t know exactly what those things
were. John doesn’t articulate. All we know is that John is calling them back to the love they had at first.
John calls them to rekindle that original spark of their early devotion to Christ. It seems to me that John
is calling them back to spiritual passion. It reminds me of Rom. 12:11, “Never be lacking in zeal, but keep
your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord.” It also reminds me of a quote by A.W. Tozer, “Their religious lives
are correct and reasonably moral, but wholly mechanical and altogether lacking in radiance.”1
Rev. 2:4 is a helpful verse for each one of us to contemplate on Communion Sunday. How is
my love for Christ today? Am I doing the things I did at first? In the early days of my Christian faith,
when I was really fired up about my new relationship with God, my faith was very active and eager.
Have I maintained that kind of love?
Or, have I grown cold in my love for God? Have I fallen into a rut of good theology and good
behavior that lacks passion and fire?
So, can you think of things you may have done in the early days of your Christian life that you
aren’t doing today? It’s kind of tough to measure just how much we truly love God. There aren’t
necessarily any easy ways to objectively measure something so subjective as love. However, last year
at youth group, I found something very helpful in measuring my own love for God. As I meditated on the
words of Mark 12:30, I found them very helpful and revealing in my personal relationship with God. Mark 12:30 says “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all
your mind and with all your strength.” That word all is used four times in a row. So, I began breaking
each one of those areas down in my own life. I asked myself questions like this, “Jerry, do you love God
with all of your heart?” “Do you love Him with all of your soul?” “Jerry, how could you love God more
deeply with all of your mind today?” “What might it look like to love God with all of my strength today?”
And, honestly, here’s what I discovered, my love for God did not look quite as fervent as it used
to look. This is when the Lord brought to mind Rev. 2:4, “…You have forsaken the love you had at first.”
Let me explain it this way. When you love a person with all of your heart, it shows in some
pretty clear ways. When you love your spouse or your kids or a close friend, it brings out your deepest
feelings and emotions. Your greatest joys and sorrows are wrapped up in those most important
relationships. You tend to get most angry when someone in those relationships is being mistreated.
You tend to shed tears due to those relationships; tears of sorrow and tears of joy. You get your
fullest, deepest belly laughs when you are around those people that you love deeply, from the heart.
So, here’s a question we all need to ask ourselves this morning: When is the last time you
loved God that way? When is the last time your relationship with Him made you laugh or cry or feel
deep emotion? Have you wept over something that breaks God’s heart? Have you rejoiced with God
over some item of praise? Have you grown angry over something that you know makes God angry?
These are a few ways we could measure whether we are loving God with all of our heart.
But how do we love God with all of our soul? Our soul is that part of us that is eternal. It’s that
part of us that can’t be seen but it will go on forever when our physical body dies. It’s the part of
ourselves that we call “me.”
Have you ever been in a situation where you are deeply troubled and greatly distressed, where
you are hurting and kind of at the end of your rope? And then, all of a sudden someone in a very close
relationship with you shows up and they say “hey, it’s me, it’s me.” They maybe even put their hand on
your shoulder. And what they mean in that moment doesn’t have much to do with their physical looks
or their money or the importance of their job title. In that moment, it has to do with their inner self and
your inner self and the relational connection between the two of you. It wouldn’t necessarily matter if
they were there in person or over the phone or whatever else. What matters in that moment, is that
they love you from their soul. The trust and depth of your soul connection trumps everything else.
Do you and God have that kind of soul connection? Do you love God with all of your soul, your
inner self? When you sing praise songs to God, do you sing just with your mind and your tongue?2 Or,
do you sing from a place deep inside of you? When you kneel down and close your eyes and meet
with the Lord in prayer. Do you ever say something like “hey God, it’s me.” Understanding that in that
moment it’s not about your money or your looks or your brains or anything else you have to offer.
You are just offering yourself. It’s just the unseen inner core of who you are connecting
with the unseen Living God, the great I am.
Do we love the Lord our God with all of our soul?
We are also called to love God with all of our minds. This has to do with your thinking and
reasoning. The mind is the place where we learn and store information.
When a young man is courting a young woman, he studies her. He finds out what she likes.
What’s her favorite candy? What are her favorite flowers? What restaurant would she like to eat at? So do we love God this way? Do we study Him and learn about Him and try to understand
what pleases Him and brings Him delight? Do we spend time reading our Bibles? Do we dig in with a
Bible study group or a Sunday School class because we want to love God more fully with our minds?
When is the last time we researched a really tough topic of theology like the trinity or did a word study
on the different names for God. If we want to love God with the entirety of our being, shouldn’t we at
least get to know His full name?
Last week in my quiet time I came across a very interesting name for God.
Ex. 34:14 says, “Do not worship any other god, for the Lord, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous
God.” One of God’s names is Jealous. That’s worth knowing and understanding and applying to our
relationship with God.
Are we loving God with all of our mind?
And, last of the four, loving God with all of our strength. This is one I’m sure I used to be better
at. In my early days as a Christian, my faith in God took all of my physical strength. I can think of
many times where I worked up quite a sweat serving God. Can you think of the last time where your
love for God caused you to take deep panting breaths because you were so exhausted and out of
breath from running after His cause? Loving God with all of our strength should not be dependent on
our youth. Regardless of our physical limits, we are called to love God with all our strength. It may get
more difficult as we get older and it may change a little, but it becomes no less important. We need to
love God with whatever strength remains in us.
Pastor Dave Smith illustrated this for me so vividly. Toward the end of his life when his
cancer had really gotten bad, he tired more quickly than usual. And yet he still insisted on parking in
the lower parking lot on Sunday mornings. By the time he made it inside the church and up the stairs,
he literally had to sit down on a bench and rest before he could finish and make it the rest of the way
to his office. Many of us encouraged him to park in the upper lot right outside the offices. But he
assured us that he was fine. He just needed a minute to catch his breath. Besides, a visitor or
someone else might need that parking space more than he did.
Do we love the Lord our God with all of our strength?
One of the reasons I wanted us to focus on our love for God today is that Mark 12:29…30
says it’s the most important commandment. The other reason is because of an illustration I heard this
past summer in Kansas City.
The illustration has to do with the top button on a shirt. We all know what
it’s like to be buttoning up our shirt and we get near the bottom and suddenly
realize that something’s not quite right. We have 3 buttons left and only 2
buttonholes to go. The bottom of the shirt just isn’t lining up. So, what do we do?
We unbutton the whole thing and start over. Only, this time, we double check to
make sure that the top button is in the top buttonhole.
This is a great illustration for our first love this morning. Does God have 1st place in
our lives? If not, all the other parts of our lives get out of place and don’t work right. If we
love anyone or anything else more than we love God, it just won’t turn out right.
This morning, as we partake of the Lord’s Supper, you’ll notice I’ve placed a small
bowl of buttons at the end of each Communion Table. If you’d like, after you’ve eaten the
bread and drank the cup, take a button and put it in your pocket. Keep it as a reminder of
today’s message. Throughout the week let it remind you that God is the first love of your life.",Jerry Johnson,"Bemidji, MN",10/5/2014,
"One of the most curious and confusing words in the English language is the word love.
For example, I love my wife and my children and my grandchildren, but I also love chocolate
chip cookies. Those two loves are, of course, not the same, but the same English word is used
to describe both of them.
Think of a rock star at the end of a concert or a famous athlete at the conclusion of some
impressive victory. They look around at all of their adoring fans and yell at the top of their
voices, “I love you all!” What does that really mean?
There is another use of the word love that I hear more and more often today. It intrigues
me and puzzles me a little too. What is the difference between loving someone and loving on
someone? (Please understand. I don’t lose any sleep over that, but I do sometimes wonder
what it actually means to love on someone. And I’m sure that several of you will come up to me
after the service this morning and enlighten me. That will be good.)
There is a much more pressing question about love that that I frequently wonder about
and that we are going to explore this morning. Think about Jesus. One of the Pharisees asked
him, “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” Jesus responded, “Love the
Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first
and greatest commandment” (Matt. 22:37-38).
Of all the questions that we might ask about love, this is the most important one: What
does it mean to love God?
The Explanation of our Love for God
When Jesus said that we should love the Lord our God with all of our heart, soul, and
mind, he was not saying anything original. He was just repeating what Moses had taught the
Israelites over a thousand years earlier. In the book of Deuteronomy Moses is preparing the
people of God to live in a new land under new leadership. A big change is going to take place.
In those new circumstances the most important thing that they can do is love God.
It is in Deuteronomy that we find for the first time the commandment to love God. The
general idea can be found in Genesis and Exodus and Leviticus and Numbers, but it is in
Deuteronomy where it is stated directly and in unmistakable terms. We find that all important
command in chapter 6 following a solemn declaration that is known among the Jewish people
today as the Shema. Deuteronomy 6:4 states the fundamental belief of Judaism. “Hear, O
Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.” Immediately after that famous and concise
statement of faith known as the Shema, comes this instruction: “Love the LORD your God with
all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength” (Deut. 6:5).
The instruction to love God is repeated several times in this Old Testament book (see
11:1, 13, 22; 13:3; 19:9; 30:6, 16, 20). The most complete explanation of it is found in
Deuteronomy 10:12-13. Please note how the instruction to love God is combined with four
other instructions.
12 And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God ask of you but to fear the LORD
your God, to walk in obedience to him, to love him, to serve the LORD your God with all
your heart and with all your soul, 13 and to observe the LORD’s commands and decrees
that I am giving you today for your own good?
Those five instructions are not five distinct and entirely unrelated commandments. In the
Bible they come all bundled together. That may at first sound strange to our modern minds.
Could it really be that fearing God is part of what it means to love God and that loving God is
part of what it means to fear God? We don’t usually think in those terms, do we? We almost 
instinctively believe that fearing God and loving God are complete opposites. Fearing God
sounds threatening and scary, but loving God sounds so warm and comforting.
But they do go together. Fearing God reminds us that God is the supreme ruler over
creation. God is not our buddy. He is “the God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty
and awesome” (Deut. 10:17). But that knowledge does not lead us to cringe in terror because
we are also told that we can and should love him. But our love for God is not a sentimental,
overly emotional, and gooey love. It is one that is combined with respect and honor.
Perhaps we can pull all five of these instructions together in one expression: Godcenteredness.
1
 That’s what Moses is talking about. God-centeredness. Everything in our lives
should have God at the very center. It’s not that we consciously think about God when we are
running an errand or taking out the trash. Instead it means that whatever we do during the day
we always come back to God.
Think of the way your day works. What are some of the things that you are always
coming back to? I think of food and sleep. Whatever I do during the day, sooner or later I am
going to get something to eat. Same is true with sleep. Sooner or later I have to get some rest.
Our daily lives can include lots of different things, but we keep coming back to the dinner table
and to our beds. We can’t live without food and sleep. No day is complete without them.
That’s the way it is with God. No day is complete without God. We do lots of different
things. We go to work, and we go to school. We fill our cars with gas, and we fix meals. We
are not consciously thinking about God during every moment of every activity. But sooner or
later we take time for God. We make it a habit of praying before every meal, and we offer a
prayer of thanksgiving before we fall asleep at night. We find time week to read God’s Word,
and we come to church every Sunday. Why? Because God is like our daily food and sleep.
God is that unchanging constant. To love God means to practice God-centeredness. Our lives
are not complete without him.
The Origin of Our Love for God
 To practice God-centeredness is a challenge. Loving God does not mean that we never
think of anything else but God. We do not need to place that kind of unrealistic burden on
ourselves. But living with God as the unchanging constant of your life is still a huge task. Who
of us is capable of consistently doing that?
It’s at this point that we need to remember something that is absolutely crucial to our
study. The origin of our love for God is God’s love for us. Our love for God is a response to the
way that he loves us. It’s not the other way around. God does not love us because we are so
good at loving him. No! That is not the way the Christian life works at all! Right after Moses
gives these five instructions that are all bundled together around the idea of God-centeredness,
he reminds the Israelites of what God has done for them.
14 To the LORD your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the
earth and everything in it. 15 Yet the LORD set his affection on your ancestors and loved
them, and he chose you, their descendants, above all the nations—as it is today. (Deut.
10:14-15)
As we saw in our study last week, the Israelites—the descendants of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob—did not deserve God’s care or attention. They were not as impressive as the
Egyptians or the Babylonians, and they did not consistently live the way that God wanted them
too. Yet—surprise of all surprises!—God chose to love them and claim them as his people!
Theologically that is called grace. Last week I suggested that grace means that God pays
attention to people who aren’t worth paying attention to. That is not a precise theological
definition, but I think that it captures the main idea. In verses 14 and 15 Moses is reminding the
Israelites of God’s grace. God is the ruler of the heavens, but amazingly he decided to love the unimpressive and unholy Israelites. Then God tells the Israelites that they should respond by
loving him in return.
We see that same principle at work in even stronger terms in the New Testament. The
apostle John summarizes it so well in 1 John 4:19. “We love because he first loved us.” Our
love for God is not something that we create within ourselves. “I have made up my mind. I am
going to love God. Just wait until he sees how good I am at loving him. He will be really
impressed!” That’s not the way the Christian life works. It always starts with relying on what God
has done for us. “God loved me enough to send his Son to this earth to take the punishment for
my sins on the cross. I have accepted that good gift. I have trusted in Jesus as my Lord, and I
know that he has forgiven me. That is so amazing! Because of his love for me, I can’t help but
want to love him in response! I want to live with him at the very center of my daily life.”
God’s grace always comes first. Let’s never forget that. The origin of our love for God
comes from his love for us.
The Demonstration of Our Love for God.
Now we need to go one step further in our exploration of loving God. How do we
demonstrate our love for God? If we really do love God, how is that shown in our daily lives?
Moses begins to answer that question in verses 16 and 17.
16 Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer. 17 For the
LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome,
who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes.
I’ve mentioned before in these studies that we are doing in Deuteronomy how
unprepared I was when I first read this Old Testament book. Early in my Christian life I had
gotten the idea that in the Old Testament God was primarily concerned with the external
aspects of life and not what was going on inside of people. That was why he gave all those
detailed instruction in Leviticus about how to sacrifice animals. It was only in the New
Testament that God became interested in people’s hearts and their interior life. But when I read
Deuteronomy that first time verse 16 jumped out at me: “Circumcise your hearts.” Circumcision
was the external sign of the covenant that God made with the Israelites, but this verse indicates
that God is not just interested in appearances. Even in the Old Testament God wanted to know
what was going on inside people’s hearts. Genuine love for God is demonstrated first in a
heartfelt attitude.
God wants to see us doing more than just going through the motions. Reading the Bible
is good. Going to church is good. But what is going on inside of us? Do we read God’s Word
just so that we can check it off of our list of necessary religious activities? Or do we read the
Bible so that we can learn about the living God and grow in our desire for his kingdom? Do we
go to church because that’s the way that we were raised, or is it because we want to spend time
with God expressing our gratitude to him for his Son along with other believers in Jesus? We
need to ask those questions of ourselves. Is our love for God demonstrated in a heartfelt
attitude?
Consider a second way that we demonstrate love for God. It’s in caring relationships.
Moses stresses in particular the way that the Israelites will deal with the people that they find
already living in the Promised Land.
18 [God] defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner
residing among you, giving them food and clothing. 19 And you are to love those who are
foreigners, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt. (Deut. 10:18-19)
Today you and I can show our love for God by caring for the people that we come into contact
with day by day.
When Jesus was asked by that Pharisee what the greatest commandment in the Law
was, he quoted from Deuteronomy. “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all you 
soul and with all your mind.” That answered the Pharisee’s question. Jesus could have
stopped right there. But without any hesitation Jesus went on to another commandment. “And
the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself’” (Matt. 22:39).
Loving other people is logically not as important as loving God. That is true. God comes
first. But we cannot separate the first and the second greatest commandments. Loving other
people is a way that we demonstrate our love for God. The second commandment is one way
that we live out the first commandment. If you and I have experienced the love of God in Jesus
and want to love God in return, then we need to care for other people.
We need to care not just for the people that we are naturally attracted to. We need to
care for people that we would rather not have anything to do with. Think again of what Moses
says to the Israelites. When Moses tells the Israelites to “love those who are foreigners,” he’s
not talking about helping a tourist from Japan located the statues of Paul and Babe in downtown
Bemidji. No, he’s talking about the Canaanites—people who speak a different language and
have different customs and have a different color of skin.
All this week we’ve been hearing about the violence and racial tension down in Ferguson,
Missouri. It’s tragic. But it’s not enough for us to grieve over what has taken place down there.
What are you and I doing here in Bemidji to overcome racial and social barriers? Do we tend to
politely avoid contact with people that aren’t like us? Or do we deliberately take steps to build
relationships with people who seem to us to be foreign and strange and who make us feel
uncomfortable to be around? That’s a challenge, but it is one that we need to accept because
that is part of what it means to love God.
Our love for God must be shown in a heartfelt attitude toward God and in caring
relationships with other people. There is a third sign of our love for God that Moses mentions in
this passage. He teaches us that love for God will be demonstrated in personal allegiance to
God. Notice the personal terms that Moses uses in verses 20 and 21.
20 Fear the LORD your God and serve him. Hold fast to him and take your oaths in his
name. 21 He is the one you praise; he is your God, who performed for you those great
and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes.
The Hebrew word in verse 20 that is translated “hold fast” is the same word that is found in that
famous passage about marriage in Genesis 2. “A man shall leave his father and mother and
shall cleave unto his wife” (Genesis 2:24 KJV). To “cleave” means to “be united to” or to “cling
to.” That’s how we are to live with God. It is personal.
Another picture of personal allegiance comes to my mind. I think of parents with a little
child. When they get that child out of the car in a busy parking lot, what do they do? Immediately
they grab that child’s hand. They don’t think about it. They are probably not even aware of what
they are doing because they have done it so many times. It’s automatic. That bond between
parent and child shows itself without any conscious thought going into the action at all.
That’s what Moses is talking about here. Hold fast to God. Cling to him! Make God a
habit. Keep coming back to thinking about what God wants. In difficult times think first about
how you can trust God. Cling to him! Hold fast to God!
Conclusion
Let’s conclude this morning with a simple exercise. When was the last time that you told
God that you loved him? Just a simple statement is all that is necessary. Tell you God that you
love him and that you want to demonstrate your love for him in your attitude, your relationships,
and most of all in the way you cling to him every day.",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",8/24/2014,
"One of the most challenging aspects of life is learning how to handle your own expectations. Do
you know what I am talking about?
Some of us tend to have unrealistically high expectations. We’re the kind of people who expect
compact cars to be spacious, luxurious cars to be economical, and used cars to be problem free. We
are always setting ourselves up for disappointment. On the other hand, there are some of us who
protect ourselves from being let down by trying hard never to have any expectations at all. And in one
sense that approach works. We’re never disappointed. Of course, we are never thankful for anything
either. Life is just an endless cycle of joyless drudgery.
How do we live with our expectations?
That’s an issue that we struggle with particularly when we are going through a time of transition.
What should you realistically expect from the new job that you have just started? How can you protect
yourself from expecting too much from the new school year that awaits you? What can you look forward
to when you find that your health is in decline? How do you deal with changes taking place within your
church?
Let’s take those questions and let them lead us into the Old Testament of Deuteronomy. When
Moses gives the instructions that we find in Deuteronomy, the people of God are in transition. They are
camped on the east bank of the Jordan River ready to enter the land that God had promised to
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Life is going to change for them in big ways. For forty years they have
been traveling around the wilderness taking their flocks from oasis to oasis, but now they are moving
into a land where they will settle down in villages and cities. No longer will they have to eke out an
existence in the desert. Now they will plant and harvest crops. God’s people are going to enter a new
land, and they are also going to have a new leader. God has told Moses that he is not going to cross
the Jordan River and enter the Promised Land. No, now it is Joshua who is going to lead them.
So what should the people expect? How can they face the future with both hopeful anticipation
and down-to-earth realism? What should the people expect?
This morning we are going to begin to look at what we might call the heart of Deuteronomy.
Chapters 4 through 11 of this book contain the teaching that Moses delivered to God’s people over three
thousand years ago, but these chapters still speak powerfully to us today. Moses is preparing the
Israelites for this huge transition in their lives, and he accomplishes that important goal by drawing their
attention to the living God. In chapter 4 he refers back to their miraculous exodus or escape from Egypt:
“You were shown these things so that you might know that the LORD is God; besides him there is no
other” (Deut. 4:35). Our English Bibles use the word “LORD” to translate “Yahweh,” the Hebrew name
for God. Moses is reminding the Israelites that Yahweh is not just one of many possible gods that could
be worshiped. He is not just a tribal or ethnic deity. He is the one and only God. “Besides him there is
no other”! Moses repeats that teaching in verse 39. “Acknowledge and take to heart this day that
[Yahweh] is God in heaven above and on the earth below. There is no other!”
Do you want to get ready for change? Do you want to have expectations that will not end up in
bitter disappointment? Moses, in effect, says, “Don’t concentrate all of your attention on what you think
might happen in the days ahead. Don’t try to make predictions. Instead just think about your God and
remember him!” The living God will be with you through all the changes that are coming. So
concentrate on him. Remember who he is! And then you will have a realistic hope for the future.
What is grace?
One of the characteristics of God that Moses emphasizes in chapters 4 through 11 is God’s
grace. Moses doesn’t actually use that term, but the idea of grace runs throughout his teaching.
What is grace? That’s a good Biblical and Christian term. We are all familiar with it, aren’t we?
Have you ever sung the song, “Amazing Grace”? Even people who have no interest in God at all sing
“Amazing Grace.” (That always strikes me as strange, but it’s true.) But what is grace?
Here’s a definition of grace that I found in a theological dictionary: Grace “is undeserved
blessing freely bestowed on man by God.” That’s a good definition. Then the article went on to discuss
the distinction between common grace and special grace. It also explained prevenient grace and
efficacious grace and irresistible grace and sufficient grace.1
 It was a good article. It was! But it
reminded me of a comment about theologians that I once came across. “Theologians are learned
people who can give entirely orthodox answers to questions that no one is asking.” I really don’t like that
observation because I am someone who values theology. But there is a kernel of truth in that comment.
If you were to give a definition of grace in your own words, how would you convey what that word
means? Maybe you are thinking of something that you learned years ago in Sunday School. Grace—
it’s spelled G-R-A-C-E. Those five letters stand for “God’s Riches At Christ’s Expense.” That’s good,
but those aren’t your words. How would you describe God’s grace in your own words?
As I thought about that this week, here’s what I came up: Grace means that God pays attention
to people who aren’t worth paying attention to. That’s my working definition of grace. It is not
theologically precise, but I think that it gets the basic message across. God pays attention to people
who aren’t worth paying attention to. That’s grace!
THE SURPRISE: Grace given
And that’s the way that Moses talks about God’s relationship to Israel. Look at what Moses says
to the Israelites as they get ready to enter the Promised Land.
7 The LORD did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more
numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. 8 But it was because the
LORD loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a
mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of
Egypt. (Deut. 7:7-8)
Are you surprised when you read that? In effect, Moses is saying, “We Israelites are really not that
impressive. There is nothing all that special about us. If God had wanted to, he could have chosen the
Egyptians or the Babylonians. They are more numerous than we are. Their civilizations are more
impressive. Their military power puts us to shame. But God chose us! Can you believe it? And why
did God choose us? Just because he did.” God pays attention to people who aren’t worth paying
attention to.
As surprising at that teaching in chapter 7 is, Moses goes even further in chapter 9. This one
should knock our socks off!
4 After the LORD your God has driven [the present inhabitants of the land] out before you,
do not say to yourself, “The LORD has brought me here to take possession of this land because
of my righteousness.” No, it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is
going to drive them out before you. 5
It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that
you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these
nations, the LORD your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your
fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. 6 Understand, then, that it is not because of your
righteousness that the LORD your God is giving you this good land to possess, for you are a stiffnecked
people. (Deut. 9:4-6)
Once again God pays attention to people who aren’t worth paying attention to.
A couple of weeks ago I told you about the first time that I ever read the book of Deuteronomy and
how I was so caught off guard by this book. I had started reading it thinking that I was going to be bored
to tears, but instead it captivated me. It was these words in chapter 9 that particularly astounded me. In
my early Christian life I had somehow gotten the idea that in the Old Testament people had to earn God’s
love and attention by their obedience to all of God’s commands. It was only in the New Testament that God started loving people who could make no claim on his attention. That was how I thought that God
worked. Then I read this passage in Deuteronomy 9, and it hit me right between the eyes.
Moses puts it so strongly. Three times he says, “God did not choose you Israelites because you
are better than anybody else. Don’t fool yourself into thinking that way. God chose to love you just
because he chose to love you.” That is grace. God pays attention to people who aren’t worth paying
attention to.
God has always been a God of grace. That was the incredible surprise that came over me when
I first read Deuteronomy. God didn’t change his mind between the Old Testament and New Testament.
No! God has always been the God of grace. He has always wanted to pay attention to people who
aren’t worth paying attention to. Isn’t that good news?
You may be sitting here this morning wondering if God could possibly be interested in you. You
think about all the things that you have done in the past and all the thoughts that have passed through
your mind at one time or another, and you conclude that there is no way that God could possibly want to
pay any attention to you. You’re wrong! That’s what God’s grace is all about! God pays attention to
people who aren’t worth paying attention to! So talk to God this morning. He’ll listen! Tell him that you
are tired of living life on your own. You’ve tried that and found that life is more than you can handle.
Say to him, “God, if you for some reason would want me, you can have me. I don’t want to be in charge
any longer. I want your Son Jesus to be my Master from now on.”
Please say that to God this morning. He will gladly take you. Why? Because he is the God of
grace. He pays attention to people who think they aren’t worth paying attention to.
THE WARNING: Grace forgotten
The first thing to do with the message of God’s grace is to be surprised by it. (In fact, if you are
not surprised by the idea that God would want to pay attention to you, then you probably haven’t
understood what grace is really all about.) But Deuteronomy has something more to teach us about
grace. In these chapters there is also a warning about grace that we need to take to heart: Grace can
be forgotten. We can get to a point where we are no longer surprised that God would pay attention to
us. We can get too used to it. We begin to take God’s attention for granted. Our focus shifts from him
to us. Moses warns the Israelites about that tendency.
10 When the LORD your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, 11 houses filled
with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive
groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied, 12 be careful that you do not forget
the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. (Deut. 6:10-12)
What a warning! And it’s one that we need to hear, isn’t it? Be careful that you do not forget the Lord.
I want to share something personal. Sometimes when I think about how God has allowed me to
be your pastor for so many years, I find myself thinking about some of the guys that I went to seminary
with. Their experience after seminary turned out to be so different from mine. Some of them were
betrayed by denominational leaders or terribly mistreated by the people in their churches. They were
forced to find another form of employment. They had no choice but to do that. I think about that a lot,
and I wonder why. They were more dedicated to God in seminary than I was. They worked harder at
their studies than I did. They had ministry skills that I do not possess. So why have I been so blessed?
I have no idea. In one sense, I don’t need to understand why either. I just need to be thankful.
Isn’t that true for all of us? Why do you and I get to enjoy the things that we do? No, none of our
lives are perfect. We all have our share of trials. Some of us have gone through extraordinary trials.
That’s true. But even after you have taken into consideration the hardships that God has placed upon
you—even then, are you ever amazed at how good God has been to you? This week we’ve been
hearing in the news about Christians in Iraq and other parts of the Middle East who have been forced
out of their homes because of their faith. You and I have never experienced anything that even comes
close to that, have we? Why have those Christians suffered that way and not us? Are we better
disciples of Jesus than they are? We know that’s not true, don’t we? Who of us can explain the
mystery of the way that God works?
Let’s just remember to be thankful. Let’s be thankful and not forget the grace that God has given
to us.
THE PROMISE: Grace restored
There is one more element to Moses’ teaching about God’s grace. First comes the surprise that
God has given us his grace. God really does pay attention to people who aren’t worth paying attention
to. Then comes the warning that grace can be forgotten. We need that warning. Let’s never take
God’s goodness for gratned. But in these chapters of Deuteronomy there is also the promise that grace
can be restored.
What happens when we do forget God and when we do settle into proud self-reliance? What
happens when we deceive ourselves into thinking that we determine the course of our existence and
that we don’t need to give God anything more than polite lip-service? God is patient with us, but sooner
or later he will let us experience the consequences of that line of thinking. Eventually we see the mess
that we have made of our lives because of our refusal to acknowledge God’s role.
The Israelites experienced that very thing. Over the course of several centuries they turned
away from God. They took his grace for granted and stopped being thankful. Eventually they
experienced the consequences of their actions, and they ended up spending seventy years as refugees
in Babylon. But that didn’t catch God off guard. Even before they entered the Promised Land, God had
given Moses instructions to pass along to the Israelites about what they should do when they found
themselves in that situation.
27 The LORD will scatter you among the peoples, and only a few of you will survive among the
nations to which the LORD will drive you. 28 There you will worship man-made gods of wood and
stone, which cannot see or hear or eat or smell. 29 But if from there you seek the LORD your God,
you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul. 30 When you are in
distress and all these things have happened to you, then in later days you will return to the LORD
your God and obey him. 31 For the LORD your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon or
destroy you or forget the covenant with your ancestors, which he confirmed to them by oath.
(Deut. 4:27-31)
Isn’t that a wonderful promise? Our God is a merciful God. He will not abandon his people even
when they have abandoned him. His grace continues. He continues to pay attention to people who
aren’t worth paying attention to.
I wonder if there is anybody here today who has turned away from God. Maybe you deliberately
walked away from God and decided to do things your own way even though you knew that you were
disobeying God. Or maybe you slipped away little by little. It was not one big decision. It was a series
of small things that eventually led you away from God. You have been sitting here this morning thinking
about the love for God that you once had. You remember trusting in Jesus as your Lord and Savior and
the joy that you had in knowing that he had forgiven you and that he loved you. But not all that seems
like a distant memory. You wish that you could get it back, but it was so long ago.
Please listen carefully to the promise of God’s grace. “The Lord your God is a merciful God, and
he will not abandon or destroy you.” God delights in restoring people to grace, and he will once again
gladly take you back. Talk to him today. Admit to him how you have neglected him and ignored him
and disobeyed him. Ask for his forgiveness, and he will joyfully forgive you. That is his promise, and he
will keep it!
Conclusion
Let’s go back to where we started this morning. None of us can predict what the future holds.
We cannot know exactly what to expect. But we can be confident of this: God will always treat his
people according to his grace. He will continue to pay attention to you and me even when we feel like
we aren’t worth paying attention to. Thank God for his grace!",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",8/17/2014,
"I don’t know what to do. I just do not know what I should do.
Oh, I’m sorry. I should have introduced myself. My name is Onesimus, and I have just
arrived back here in Colossae. I came with Tychicus. We’ve traveled all the way here from
Rome. The apostle Paul sent us here with two letters.1
 One of them—the one that Tychicus
has—is for the Colossians. Well, I mean, it’s a letter for all of the followers of Jesus who live
here in Colossae. It will be read to them the next time they get together. But this letter that I’ve
got is for just one of them. It’s for Philemon, and Paul told me that he wanted me to deliver it to
Philemon.
And that’s the problem. Should I give it to Philemon or not? His house is just up the
street here and around the corner. I’ve come all the way from Rome in order to deliver this
letter to Philemon, but now that I’m just a few steps away from his house—oh, I don’t know. I
don’t know what to do. Should I really take this letter and give it to Philemon? I know that’s
what Paul wants me to do. But is that really what God wants me to do?
I’ll explain. Not long ago I lived here in Colossae. I lived in that house just up street and
around the corner. I was a member of the household of Philemon. He’s an important man here
in Colossae. He runs a business that has connections all around the empire. Lots of people
are in and out of his house—his wife, Apphia, and their children, and plenty of other relatives
too. People are constantly coming and going to talk with Philemon about his business. Of
course, to manage such a large and important household, lots of slaves are needed. I was one
of his slaves.
I hated being a slave. It wasn’t that Philemon treated any of us slaves that badly. And I
knew that there was a good possibility that in a few years I would be able to buy my freedom
from Philemon. Lots of slaves do that, but I didn’t want to wait until I had managed somehow to
save up enough money for that. I didn’t like being owned by some other person and having to
do whatever he wanted me to do. I didn’t go against Philemon’s commands. I knew better than
that, but I didn’t do anything more than I had to either.
So I came up with a plan. When Philemon was away on one of his business trips, I’d
take off late at night. I’d head down the Lycus Valley to Ephesus. There I could get on board a
ship. Eventually I would work my way to Rome. I had been to Rome before. I had gone there
with Philemon on a business trip once. Rome is so big. The crowds are so huge. It would be
easy to hide away among all those people. Nobody would ever know that I was a runaway
slave.
So that’s what I did. I knew where Philemon kept his money, and I took some. After all,
I would need it if I was going to get all the way to Rome. I found a ship in Ephesus that was
headed across the Aegean Sea to Corinth, and I paid for my passage. In Corinth I found
another ship to take me across the Adriatic Sea. It was a long journey, but I made it. I got all
the way to Rome. I was free!
Then one day I was buying some food in a marketplace there in Rome, and I heard a
voice behind me. “Onesimus? Is that you, Onesimus?” I froze. Then I turned around, and there was Epaphras. I knew Epaphras. He was from here in Colossae too. He was glad to see
me and asked what I was doing in Rome. I didn’t tell him that I had run away from my master. I
just told him that I was there with Philemon on a business trip. He just shrugged his shoulders
and didn’t give it a second thought. I asked him what he was doing in Rome, and he told me
that he was there with his friend Paul.
I had heard about Paul. To make a long story short, Paul was a Jewish teacher who had
lived down in the city of Ephesus for two or three years. He told people about a Jewish rabbi
named Jesus, and he urged people to become followers of this Jesus. That’s what Epaphras
did. He become a follower of Jesus. Then Epahpras came back up the Lycus Valley to
Colossae and started telling everybody he knew about Jesus. I didn’t pay any attention to what
he was saying, but Philemon did. Philemon became a follower of Jesus, and he let Epaphras
and the other followers of Jesus meet together in his house.
I did notice that Philemon changed after he became a follower of Jesus. Like I said
earlier, Philemon never treated us slaves badly, but after he became a follower of Jesus he was
nicer to us. He seemed to actually care about us and how we were doing. He had never done
that before. But it didn’t really make any difference to me. I didn’t care how well he treated me.
I was still his slave, and I wanted to be free!
During that conversation with Epaphras there in the marketplace, he invited me to come
with him to visit Paul. Paul was in prison, and I really didn’t want to go there. But Epaphras
kept telling me how much he wanted me to meet Paul, so I finally gave in. I remember so well
that first time I met Paul. Right away I got the impression that he was really interested in me.
That surprised me. He was in prison! He didn’t know what was going to happen to him, but he
wanted to know all about me.
That was just the start. I won’t go into all the details, but I went to see Paul more than
just that one time. I so often wondered why I was doing that. A runaway slave going to a prison
to visit someone he hardly knew? It didn’t make much sense, but that’s what I did. Paul and I
talked. We talked about all kinds of things, but mostly we talked about Jesus. Paul said that
Jesus was the most extraordinary person who had ever lived on earth. I remember him telling
me how Jesus had been different from all of the other Jewish rabbis. The other teachers had
taught their followers about how to find the way to God, but Jesus said that he was the way to
God! That did seem like a pretty amazing thing to say about yourself. Of course, anybody can
say things like that. But Paul said that Jesus had not just said things that were amazing. He
had performed miracles too. Paul gave examples. Jesus had healed people with all kinds of
diseases, and one time he had walked on top of the water in a lake. Paul said that Jesus had
even raised one man named Lazarus from the dead!
Then Paul told me that Jesus had been crucified. He had been nailed to a cross and left
to die. I’ve seen how Roman soldiers crucify people. . . But Paul told me that Jesus’ crucifixion
was not the end of the story. Jesus had died and been buried in a tomb, but then three days
later he had come back to life! Not only that but forty days later Jesus had been standing on a
hill, and his disciples had seen him physically going up to heaven!
That was a bit much. I could understand how this Jesus of Paul’s was a special teacher.
And I could even imagine someone that special performing miracles. But someone who is
crucified comes back to life and then disappears into heaven? Come on.
But then Paul started talking about something else. He started talking about
forgiveness. He said that Jesus had died on the cross so that people could be forgiven for all of
the wrong things that they had done. People who believed in Jesus and became his followers 
could have all of their sins forgiven. Because of Jesus’ crucifixion God promised that he would
not punish any follower of Jesus for anything that he had done wrong.
That caught my attention! Could Jesus even forgive a runaway slave? I knew that what
I had done was wrong. I knew it was wrong to steal that money from Philemon and then run
away to Rome. Could God forgive me of doing that? I listened real carefully to what Paul was
saying. He said that Jesus didn’t just die for the little things that people do that are wrong. He
died on that cross for the very worst of things that anybody had ever done. Paul said that more
than once! I was listening real carefully. It sounded like Jesus could even forgive a runaway
slave like me. So I decided I would believe in Jesus. I became a follower of Jesus too. It was
so good to know that I was forgiven!
Over the next few weeks and months I visited with Paul a lot of times. It was like he
became a father to me, and he treated me as if I was his son. He kept teaching me about Jesus
and how I could live for him. I loved getting together with Paul so that I could learn more about
Jesus.
One time—I’ll never forget it—Paul asked me, “Onesimus, what are you doing here in
Rome?”
That caught me off guard. I told him the same thing that I had told Epaphras in the
marketplace. ""I’m here on a business trip with Philemon.”
But then Paul looked me right in the eyes. “Onesimus, I’ve never known Philemon or
any other businessman to stay this long in Rome on a business trip. And you haven’t even
mentioned Philemon for a long time. Onesimus, what are you doing here in Rome?”
I didn’t know what to say. I was really scared. I didn’t know what Paul would do. Would
he tell the Roman authorities about me? Would I end up in prison? . . . Well, I did tell him the
truth. What else could I do? I knew that I wasn’t going to fool him.
Paul thanked me for telling him the truth, and he assured me that he still loved me. But
he also asked me to think about what God wanted me to do about the way that I had run away
from my master, Philemon. So I did. The first thing I thought was that Paul was absolutely
crazy! Was he really suggesting that I go back to Colossae and Philemon? No way was I going
to do that! Did he really want me to give up the freedom that I was now enjoying? Did he want
me to be a slave again? And besides that, what would Philemon do with me if I did return?
What kind of punishment would I suffer?
And another thought entered by mind too. Wasn’t I forgiven for what I had done in the
past? Hadn’t Paul told me that Jesus had died on the cross for all the things that I had done
wrong? Wouldn’t that include running away from my master? I was forgiven! So why was Paul
talking to me about what God might want me to do about Philemon? It just did not make any
sense at all! I didn’t need to do anything about Philemon! That was all in the past! It was all
over and done with! I was forgiven!
But Paul kept talking about it. Oh, he was gentle with me but he kept bringing the
subject up and asking me if I was thinking about it. So I did keep thinking—and praying.
Eventually I understood. Jesus had come to this earth to repair my relationship with God.
That’s why he had died on the cross. But Jesus had also come to teach his followers about how
they could repair their relationships with the people that they had wronged. I was forgiven by
God. That was true! But now God wanted me to go and ask Philemon to forgive me for the way
that I had treated him.
It took me a long time to understand that. I argued with Paul about it. And I argued with
God about it too! Couldn’t Jesus find something else for me to do to take care of this problem?
There had to be another way! Maybe I could work real hard and earn a lot of money that I could
then send to Philemon in payment for how I had robbed him. I could even send him enough
money to buy my freedom from him! Wouldn’t that be OK? I didn’t need to go back to Colossae
and actually see Philemon face to face, did I?
Oh, I argued with God and tried to make some kind of a deal with him. But eventually I
realized that I couldn’t bargain with God. I needed to do what my Lord Jesus was asking me to
do.
I had just come to the end of that struggle with God when Paul told me that he was
sending Tychicus back east with an important letter for the Colossians. He told me that I could
go back to Colossae with Tychicus. He would write a letter for me, and I could take it to
Philemon. Paul said that he would urge Philemon to take me back and forgive me. He would
tell Philemon that he should take me back not just as a slave in his household. No, he should
welcome me back as a brother in the Lord—as a family member in the household of Jesus.
So here I am in Colossae with this letter that Paul has written to Philemon. His house is
just up the street and around the corner. Does God really want me to do this? I don’t know
what Philemon’s going to do. I have no idea how he is going to treat me. Do I really need to go
and hand this letter to Philemon? It sounded like the right thing to do when I was in Rome with
Paul. But now that I’m here, I don’t know. Is this really what God wants?
Has God ever asked you to do something that you didn’t want to do? Something so
big—so hard—that you at first thought God couldn’t possibly be asking you to do it? Do you
know what I’m talking about? Have you ever argued with God? Have you ever tried to bargain
with God so that you could get out of what you knew that he wanted you to do? Have you ever
gone back and forth with God? You wonder if you can count on God if you do the hard thing
that he’s asking of you. You wonder whether God will remain faithful to you. Sometimes you
are ready to step forward and do exactly what God is expecting of you. But at other times you
back off because you’re scared. Do you know what that’s like?
So what should I do? I’ve come all the way from Rome. Here I am in Colossae with
Paul’s letter to Philemon. There is his house just up the street and around the corner.
Here’s what I’ve decided: I am going to finish this journey. I am going to do what God
wants me to do!
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",7/27/2014,
"This morning and next Sunday morning we are going to look at the little New Testament
book of Philemon. It’s a short book. It only has 335 words in it. That’s in Greek. The English
translation that I’m using has 480 words. But either way—Greek or English—Philemon is a
short book.
It is also an intriguing little book. In fact, the more I think about what we read in this
book, the more interesting it becomes. We don’t have anything else quite like it in the New
Testament. For one thing, it is a private letter. Paul is writing to this man named Philemon
about a personal matter. The subject of the letter should also capture our attention. Paul writes
to Philemon about a slave of his who has run away. The slave’s name is Onesimus. But here’s
the thing that I find particularly fascinating. It is Onesimus, the runaway slave himself, who
delivers this letter to his master.
But as intriguing as all of that is, what relevance does it have for us today? Have any of
you encountered a runaway slave recently? This letter may be interesting from a historical point
of view. We learn something about the cultural setting of the Christians in first century of the
Roman Empire, but what does it have to do with you and me in twenty-first century America?
Let’s think about our cultural setting. What do we see and experience here in the United
States? A couple of weeks ago I caught a conversation on the radio about the role of social
media in our culture. What impact has the internet and email and cell phones and texting made
in our society? One of the persons being interviewed suggested that the use of social media
has actually delayed people from developing the skills necessary to interact with others in a
personal way.
The question on researchers’ minds is whether all that texting, instant messaging
and online social networking allows children to become more connected and supportive
of their friends—or whether the quality of their interactions is being diminished without
the intimacy and emotional give and take of regular, extended face-to-face time. . . .
. . . today’s youths may be missing out on experiences that help them develop
empathy, understand emotional nuances and read social cues like facial expressions
and body language.1
Apparently no one is really sure whether that is true or not, but it’s an interesting question to
ask. What is the long-term effect of social media on relationships?
Perhaps we can use the terminology of social media to ask a more general question
about our culture. On Facebook you can “unfriend” people. Stop and think about that verb—
“unfriend.” Is that terminology just a curious characteristic of Facebook? Or does it say
something about our culture in general?
Think about relationships. We live in a mobile society. Therefore, relationships come
and go frequently and quickly. Add into the equation one of our society’s primary values—
individual choice. How often do we hear people say that they have to take care of themselves
and have to do things for their own good? There is a small kernel of truth to that, but our culture
seems to have taken it to an extreme. The idea of making a costly decision for the good of
society as a whole is rarely mentioned. The value of others in the community and even the value
of other people in your own family takes second place to individual rights. The first question is
always: “What so I need to do for me?” What does that mentality do to our relationships?
Think about the church. How often do Christians today move from one church to another
church? Don’t get me wrong. There is a time to leave a church and move to another one. But do we today make that change too quickly? It’s so easy. You don’t particularly like something
going on in the church, or you have a disagreement with someone in the church. Just leave!
You don’t have to put up with those people! You can always find some other church!
Just a couple of days ago I learned about a book that has recently come out. It’s titled
How to Be a Christian Without Going to Church. Here’s a person who has trusted in Christ as
Lord and who says she has a relationship with the living God but who doesn’t sense any need
to be a part of any local church. But what is the church? It’s people. That person is, in effect,
saying, “I can live out my Christian life without people. I don’t need other people in order to be a
follower of Jesus.” Is that true? Is that what God’s Word teaches us?
The Value of Relationships
Let’s go back to the little book of Philemon. Consider the value that Paul places on
relationships.
Paul is in the city of Rome when he writes this letter. There in the capital of the empire
Paul meets a man named Onesimus. He’s a slave who has run away from his master, Philemon.
I find it intriguing to think about how Paul meets Onesimus there in Rome. Paul is in
prison. A slave who has broken the law and run away from his master is probably not going to
make a social call on someone in prison. He is going to stay as far away from the authorities as
possible! So how do Paul and Onesimus find each other in Rome?
Verse 23 informs us that one of the persons with Paul at this time is Epaphras. This
man named Epaphras is from the city of Colossae. How do we know that? Paul mentions
Epaphras in his letter to Colossians. In that letter he describes Epaphras as “one of you” Col.
4:12). In his letter to the Colossians, Paul also calls Onesimus “one of you” (Col. 4:9). So both
Epaphras and Onesimus are from the same city—Colossae.
Put those pieces of the puzzle together and use your imagination. I picture Epaphras
buying some food in a marketplace somewhere in Rome.
2
 Then to his amazement he sees
someone he knows from his hometown of Colossae. It’s Onesimus!
Onesimus is surprised to see Epaphras there in the marketplace. But he’s also glad to
see Epaphras! It’s always a nice surprise to see someone you know when you are over a
thousand miles away from home. That’s how far Rome is from Colossae. It’s a twelve hundred
mile trip between those two cities. So these two men unexpectedly meet in the marketplace
and start to talk. Of course, Onesimus doesn’t tell Epaphras that he has run away from his
master. He lets Epaphras think that Philemon has sent him to Rome on business. It is not
unheard of for a master to send a slave on a long trip like that in the first century. Then after
that encounter in the marketplace Epaphras takes Onesimus to see Paul.
Something happens between those two men. We don’t know how long it took or exactly
how it came about, but it’s through Paul that Onesimus comes to faith in Jesus Christ. If you
read a little between the lines, you learn that Onesimus does not just trust in Jesus as his Lord.
He also helps Paul in some significant way. “I appeal to you for my son Onesimus, who
became my son while I was in chains. Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become
useful both to you and to me” (Philemon 10-11 emphasis added). Use your imagination again.
Paul leads Onesimus to faith in Christ, and there is a strong personal bond forged between the
two of them. Paul thinks of Onesimus as a son, and Onesimus treats Paul as a father. But sometime in their conversations Paul learns that Onesimus is not in Rome for
business. He has run away from his master, Philemon. So sooner or later Paul says to
Onesimus, “You have got to go back to Colossae. If you are going to be a disciple of the Lord
Jesus, you have got to go back to your master, Philemon.”
Don’t you wonder if that is hard for Paul to say that to Onesimus. He’s led this man to
faith in Jesus Christ, and he has grown to genuinely love Onesimus. “I am sending him—who is
my very heart—back to you” (Philemon 12 emphasis added). Furthermore, Paul could really
use his help there in Rome. “I would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your
place in helping me while I am in chains for the gospel” (Philemon 13).
What if Paul decides not to send Onesimus back? In all likelihood Philemon will never
learn that Paul has met Onesimus in Rome or that Paul has decided to keep him there in Rome.
After all, the two cities were twelve hundred miles apart. It can be their little secret. The only
people who know are Paul and Onesimus and maybe Epaphras.
Add one more factor into your thinking. What might happen to a runaway slave who
does go back to his master? What could Philemon do with his slave who has broken the law
and run away from him? I wonder if that kept Paul awake some nights.
But Paul does send Onesimus back. Why? Because Philemon is fellow believer in
Jesus Christ. Paul addresses him in verse 1 as a “dear friend and fellow worker.” Philemon is
important to Paul. He is just as important to Paul as Onesimus is. Philemon is a leader of the
church in Colossae, and Paul apparently knows him well. That’s why at the end of the letter
Paul feels free to tell Philemon to prepare a guest room for him in case he gets out of prison
soon and comes to Colossae (Philemon 22). Paul’s relationship to Philemon is valuable. It is
too valuable to keep Onesimus with him in Rome.
Doesn’t that say something to us today about relationships? Through Jesus Christ our
relationships with other believers are important. We don’t “unfriend” other believers in Christ.
I’m not talking about what we do on Facebook. I’m talking about the way that we treat each
other. When you have troubles with another Christian—when you don’t see eye-to-eye on
something going on in the church—when that other Christian’s personality just rubs you the
wrong way—what should you do? It’s tempting just to move on and leave them behind. But
because of Jesus our relationships with other Christians are too valuable for that.
The Motivation in Relationships
So Paul sends Onesimus back to Philemon. He also gives a letter to Onesimus to
deliver to Philemon when he sees him. In this letter Paul makes an appeal. He tries to reason
with Philemon so that he will accept Onesimus back.
Paul’s appeal to Philemon is multi-dimensional. In fact, when I read through this letter, I
sometimes think that Paul almost goes too far.
4
I always thank my God as I remember you in my prayers, 5 because I hear
about your love for all his holy people and your faith in the Lord Jesus. . . .
7 Your love
has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the
hearts of the Lord’s people. (Philemon 4-5, 7)
Is that just a nice compliment, or does it border on flattery? Later on in the letter Paul makes a
strong emotional appeal.
18 If he has done you any wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. 19 I, Paul, am
writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back—not to mention that you owe me your
very self. (Philemon 18-19 emphasis added)
I don’t know about you, but that sounds almost like manipulation to me. Paul is really on the
edge here!
It is true that Paul is marshalling every argument that he can think of in order to get
Philemon to welcome his runaway slave back. He fully realizes just how much he is asking of
Philemon. But the driving motivation behind this letter is love. ”Therefore, although in Christ I
could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do, yet I prefer to appeal to you on the
basis of love” (Philemon 8-9a).
“Philemon,” Paul writes “do you love God? I know you do! Then do what’s best for God’s
honor and for God’s people. Onesimus is not just your slave anymore. Now he’s your brother in
Christ. Please think about him that way and love him as you would a member of your own
family. And that church that meets in your home, Philemon—what is it going to mean to those
people to see you loving a slave? What will be the long-term impact of them witnessing how you
can forgive someone who has broken the law and wronged you? And, Philemon,” Paul says, “is
it too much to ask that you love me too? It would mean so much to me to know that you have
welcomed Onesimus back. Please refresh my heart in Christ by loving your runaway slave.”
Love is the driving motivation. It was in the first century, and it needs to be the
foundational motivation in our relationships here in the twenty-first century too.
The Challenge of Relationships
I say that with some hesitancy. That sounds terrible, doesn’t it? “Pastor Fred, you’re
reluctant to talk about love? What is wrong with you?”
Our culture makes love sound so easy, but genuine love is always a challenge. Look at
what Paul is asking Philemon to do. “So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you
would welcome me” (Philemon 17 emphasis added). “Welcome your runaway slave back.
Don’t just let him slip in through the back door. Welcome him as you would a loved one who
has been gone on a long journey and has just come home!’
Can you imagine what Philemon’s neighbors might say? “Hey, Philemon, what do you
think that you’re doing? Our slaves are going to see the way that you’ve treated Onesimus, and
they’re going to start thinking that we should treat them that way too. Some of them might even
think about running away like Onesimus did! Come on, Philemon, you need to teach Onesimus
a lesson so that all the other slaves here in Colossae get the message too! And, Philemon,
please spare us all that talk about your Jesus and how he changes everything. We’re not
interested in that nonsense!”
In this letter Paul is challenging Philemon to go against his culture when it comes to
relationships. Doesn’t God ask the same of you and me in our culture? We’re to love people
the way that Jesus does even if it is not the way that our culture operates. There is a cost that
comes with loving other people. We don’t base everything on our individual rights and our
particular desires. We fight that tendency to think about what we want and what we say is good
for ourselves. Jesus calls us to go against the grain of our culture. We need to resist that
temptation to “unfriend” other people.
Conclusion
In this little letter to Philemon, God calls you and me to live out our faith in our
relationships with each other. God calls us to sacrifice for each other and to persevere with
each other even when we would rather run away.
Have you got problems with someone in your family or with someone at school or work?
Maybe you have problems with someone in the church. Someone in the youth group has hurt
you with a careless or harsh comment. The decisions being made aren’t exactly what you think
is best. Our culture says, “Go and find something new.” But our Lord tells us to love one
another. Accept the challenge! Pay the price! Let your relationships be an expression of your
devotion to Jesus.
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",7/20/2014,
"For most of us, the Lord’s Supper is familiar territory. We’ve been here before. There are no
great surprises. We know what is going to happen. Perhaps we can even recite the words that come
from 1 Corinthians 11. “The Lord Jesus, on the night in which he was betrayed, took bread, and . . .”
Yet there is one aspect of the Lord’s Supper that I tend to neglect. I would guess that the same
is true for you. We usually think of the Lord’s Supper as a time to remember what happened centuries
ago in the city of Jerusalem. The bread and the cup are a reminder to us of how Jesus died on the
cross and how his execution on that cross paid the penalty for our sins. We should remember that! If
Christ had not willingly taken upon himself the punishment for our sins, there would be no salvation.
We would not be reconciled to God. We would not know God or be able to enjoy his love. In the Lord’s
Supper we do remember the past.
But there is also a future element to this meal. Jesus himself refers to it when he is with his
disciples at his last supper.
26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it
and gave it to his disciples, saying, ""Take and eat; this is my body.""
27 Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, ""Drink
from it, all of you. 28 This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the
forgiveness of sins. 29 I tell you, I will not drink from this fruit of the vine from now on until that
day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom."" (Matt. 26:26-29 emphasis added)
In that last statement Jesus is looking to the future. He’s looking forward to his return to this
earth. When he comes in his glory with all of his angels, his Father’s kingdom will then be established
once and for all. There will be a banquet held for God’s people. The Book of Revelation refers to it as
the wedding supper of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9). It will be a grand celebration! Imagine the most
sumptuous and delicious banquet that can. All of your favorite delicacies are there on your plate, and
they have been made to perfection. The wedding supper of the Lamb is going to be even better.
It will be better not so much because of the food but because of the people that you will be
sharing the meal with. The disciples who sat with Jesus in that upper room in Jerusalem so many
centuries ago will be there. Remember what Jesus said to them: “I will drink it new with you in my
Father’s kingdom.” Peter and James and John are going to be there. Everyone who has ever trusted
in Christ as Lord and Savior will be there with them to join in the celebration. You and I—if we are
trusting in Christ alone for our salvation—we’ll be there too!
Try to imagine what that’s going to be like! All the saints of all the ages will be gathered
together. We will be able to survey that vast gathering made up of believers from “every tribe and
language and people and nation” (Rev. 5:9). “Look, there is the apostle Paul! Over there is Mary
Magdalene. I remember reading about her in the New Testament. There she is! There is my Sunday
School teacher and my youth leader who helped me to grow so much as a young Christian. There’s
that girl that I led to Christ at summer camp. I always wondered what happened to her. Here she is in
heaven. There’s my grandfather. I’d heard about his faith and godly example, but he died when I was
so young. I never really got to know him. But here he is, and now we’re going to be together forever.”
Oh, it will be a grand reunion!
But as wonderful as meeting all those other people will be, our eyes will be focused most of all
on Jesus himself. We will marvel at him. We will think back to that gruesome death on the cross, and
then we will fall at his feet in stunned adoration as we realize anew that the effects of his death have
reverberated all through human history.
A man was executed by Roman soldiers on a hill outside of Jerusalem. That was not all that
noteworthy back in the first century. The Romans crucified lots of people that they deemed to be
rebels. But when that Jewish carpenter hung upon the cross, the world changed. It’s never been the
same since. Over the centuries people from every ethnic background and every national allegiance
have come to trust in him and to know him as Lord. Today people from all over the world are trusting in 
Christ and learning to rest in his love. The effects of his death continue even to the present day. And
they will continue for all of eternity as well.
Does that make you thankful for Jesus’ death on the cross? Does it fill you with a longing for
heaven? Are you looking forward to that time when you see Jesus drinking from the fruit of the vine in
his Father’s kingdom? What’s it going to be like when he invites you to join him in that festive banquet?
Jesus spoke about the future at his last supper. When the apostle Paul gave his instructions
about the Lord’s Supper to the Corinthians, he also referred to the future. He told them that “whenever
you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes” (1 Cor. 11:26). At
this meal we think of the past, and we long for the future.
That future element has always been part of the Lord’s Supper. There is an early Christian
document known as The Didache. (Didache is a Greek word that means “teaching.”) The Didache or
The Teaching was written within a generation or two after the apostles, and it tells us about a tradition
that developed early in the life of the church. The early Christians would conclude their observance of
the Lord’s Supper by saying “Maranatha” (The Didache 10:6).
Maranatha. That’s such an interesting word. It is only found one time in the New Testament,
but it is still a significant expression that’s worth thinking about. Maranatha is an Aramaic word. But
Paul uses it at the very end of the first letter that he writes to the Corinthians. He says, “Maranatha.
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you” (1 Cor. 16:22b-23).
Think this through with me. The city of Corinth is in Greece. We can be quite sure that most of
the Corinthians didn’t speak Aramaic. They spoke Greek. So why does Paul use an Aramaic
expression in his letter to Greek-speaking Christians?
Suppose that I suddenly used a Bengali expression in this sermon. Suppose that I used an
important Bengali expression—some word that every person in Bangladesh would immediately
recognize. It still wouldn’t mean anything to the vast majority of us here, would it? Because we don’t
know so much as a single word in Bengali.
But Paul uses an Aramaic expression when he writes to Greek-speaking Christians. If you stop
to think about it, that tells us something. The Aramaic expression, Maranatha, must have been so wellknown
among Christians in the first century that even people who didn’t know any Aramaic at all would
still have recognized that term. It’s like the word Hallelujah. That’s a Hebrew word, but almost all of us
know it. Why? Because it’s a Hebrew word that has been used so often that it has also, in effect,
become an English expression for praise to God. Most of us don’t speak Hebrew, but we still know the
word Hallelujah. So it was in the early church. The Aramaic expression Maranatha was used so often
by the early Christians that no translation was necessary. Even Greek-speaking Christians knew what
it meant.
That expression, Maranatha, is a prayer. It’s a short prayer but a powerful one. It means, “O
Lord, come!” All the early Christians recognized that prayer. It was a prayer that all Christians no
matter what their linguistic or cultural background would use because it so beautifully expressed the
hope and longing of their hearts. “Maranatha! O Lord, come!” Doesn’t that short prayer express the
longing of your heart?
In this life we have tasted of the goodness of the Lord. Isn’t that true? Aren’t you glad that you
have trusted in Jesus Christ? Aren’t you glad that all of your sins are forgiven and that God does hold
them against you? Aren’t you glad to know that even in the most perplexing of trials, God still has his
hand on you? And aren’t you glad that he is never going to let go of you?
In this life we have tasted of the goodness of the Lord, but the full banquet awaits us in the
future. Don’t you long to see Jesus? What’s it going to be like to see the One who died for you on the
cross and to see him face to face? What will it be like to eat this meal with him in his Father’s kingdom?
Maranatha! O Lord, come!
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",7/13/2014,
"Several years ago after a worship service, one person in the congregation came up to me and
asked me a question about my sermon. “Fred, you said in your sermon that through faith in Christ we
can enter into God's love and then experience God's love. But doesn't God love us even before we
trust in Jesus?”
That’s a good question. Does God’s love for us somehow change when we trust in Jesus as
Lord? Or is God’s love for us exactly the same both before and after we decide to entrust our existence
to Christ? If God’s love is exactly the same, then why would we need to trust in Jesus at all?
How would you answer those questions?
For years I have found the subject of God’s love to be puzzling. We use those three words,
“God loves you,” so often. They are such a part of our culture that they seem to have lost their
meaning and impact. Tell most people today that God loves them, and they will shrug their shoulders
and say, “Of course, he does. What else is new?”
I’m convinced that we Christians need to study with more care and think with more diligence
about what the Bible actually teaches on this subject of God’s love.1
 As I mentioned last week, there are
at least five distinguishable ways that the Bible describes God's love. We need to be careful that we
don’t turn God into a two dimensional cartoon character. There is more that we need to say about the
living God than just repeating “God loves you” until it becomes nothing more than a meaningless cliché.
We don’t talk about human love in such simplistic terms. I love my children and my
grandchildren but not in the same way that I love my wife. There are different facets to human love.
We not only recognize those differences. We insist on them. In marital love there should be a sexual
dimension, but we would insist that there should not be a sexual dimension to parental love. If there
are important distinctions within our understanding of human love, why should it surprise us that there
are different dimensions to God's love?
Three Aspects of God’s Love
Let's quickly review what we learned last week. First, the Bible describes what we can call
God's Father-Son love. This is the love that exists between God the Father and his Son Jesus (John
3:35; 5:20; 14:31). This is an eternal love. Even before time began, the Father loved the Son and the
Son loved the Father. It is also a holy love that is untouched by sin. None of our human expressions of
love are like that. All of our human love is tarnished by sin and selfishness to some degree. But God’s
Father-Son love is unique in its eternal and holy nature.
You and I cannot plumb the depths of this love; we cannot really fathom it. But what we can
understand is God has always been characterized by love. The Father has always loved the Son, and
the Son has always loved the Father. Love is an essential part of who God is.
Last week we also thought about God's providential love. God lovingly provides for his creation.
Jesus talks in the Sermon on the Mount about how God feeds the birds of the air even though they do
not sow or reap or store away in barns (Matt. 6:26). Since we human beings are also a part of God's
creation, we also experience God's providential love. Again Jesus teaches in the Sermon on the Mount
how God ""causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the
unrighteous""
(Matt. 5:45). In the sense of God's providential love, we can say that God loves the
terrorist as much as he loves the terrorist’s victims. With God's providential love, sin is not an issue.
It is only with the third strand of biblical teaching where sin needs to be taken into account.
Now we are talking about God's saving love. When we read in John 3:16 about how ""God so loved the
world that he gave his one and only Son,"" the world refers not to creation but to rebellious humanity  (John 15:18-19). God decided to love the people who had disobeyed him and rebelled against him.
That's amazing! No matter how many times we have heard the good news before, we should still be
astounded by it. God loves a world that is not only big; he loves a world that is bad. This is a universal
love. God loves the terrorist. He offers salvation to the very worst. That's God's saving love.
I mentioned last week that there are two noteworthy characteristics to God’s saving love. First,
it requires a response from us. Forgiveness is not automatic. We need to respond to God’s offer of
love by entrusting our lives to Jesus Christ. We need to rely upon Jesus and his death and resurrection
to make us right with God. A deliberate and conscious choice to surrender to Jesus needs to be made.
Second, it is with God’s saving love that we see most forcefully God’s emotion. God yearns for
us to repent of our sins and turn to his Son in faith. He pleads with us, and then he waits patiently for
us to respond. God’s love is not some dry and abstract intellectual concept. God's love is emotional
and personal. Nowhere does the Bible highlight that more than when it comes to God's saving love.
God’s Covenantal Love
That brings us to the fourth strand of biblical teaching. I've called it God's covenantal love. The
Bible talks about how God enters into a covenant or solemn and committed relationship with his people.
In love he claims them as his own. We find this covenantal love expressed in both the Old and New
Testaments.
Listen to what God says to the nation of Israel in Deuteronomy 7:7-8:
The Lord did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more
numerous than other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. But it was because the
Lord loved you and kept the oath he swore to your ancestors that he brought you out with a
mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery, from the power of Pharaoh king of
Egypt.
Did you catch that? God did not choose the descendants of Abraham because there was something
impressive about them. God decided to love them because he decided to love them. Look at what
God goes on to say later in Deuteronomy.
To the Lord your God belong the heavens, even the highest heavens, the earth and
everything in it. Yet the Lord set his affection on your ancestors and loved them, and he chose
you, their descendants, above all the nations, as it is today. (Deut. 10:14-15)
Those are remarkable passages. God claims Israel as his own people, and he states so clearly that
this love for Israel is different from his dealings with other nations. It is a special love that he has for
Israel alone. God has not entered into a covenant like this with the other nations. Furthermore, God
states that the Israelites did not in any way deserve or earn this special love (see also Deut. 9:4-6). It is
all of God's own doing.
One more thing to note about this covenantal love: it is a once-for-all love. Once God claimed
Israel for himself, he never changed his mind. Read through the Old Testament, and you will find that
God disciplines the Israelites for their sins. But no matter how severely and persistently they sin, he
never abandons them or deserts them. The prophet Jeremiah puts it so beautifully:
This is what the Lord says,
he who appoints the sun
to shine by day,
who decrees the moon and the stars
to shine by night,
who stirs up the sea
so that its waves roar--
the Lord Almighty is his name:
“Only if these decrees vanish from my sight,”
declares the Lord,
“will Israel ever cease
being a nation before me.”
This is what the Lord says:
“Only if the heavens above can be measured
and the foundations of the earth below be searched out
will I reject all the descendants of Israel
because of all they have done,”
declares the Lord. (Jer. 31:35-37)
What a declaration of faithfulness! When God establishes a covenant with his people, he never goes
back on his word!
That was true in the Old Testament, and it is true in the New Testament as well. In 1 Peter 2:9
the apostle Peter describes the church by using terms that Moses had earlier used in describing Israel.
“But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s special possession, that you may
declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.” God has claimed
the church and all those who believe in his Son Jesus as his own. We don't deserve his love. We
haven't earned his love. But God has set his affection upon us, and, therefore, we are his both now
and forever!
I think back to my conversation after that worship service years ago. Does God love people
before they trust in Jesus as Lord and Savior? Yes. God in love offers salvation to all people. That is
God's saving love. Is there another dimension to God's love that can be entered into and that is only
entered into through faith in Christ? Yes! There is a difference between being offered a gift and
actually receiving that gift. And what a difference it is! To know that God has claimed you in love, and
then to rest in that love of God—oh, what a difference that makes! Please don't take false assurance
from the mere knowledge that God offers you his love. Be sure that you go on and receive his gift of
love in Christ. Trust in Christ as your Savior and experience God's covenantal love.
God’s Conditional Love
There is one further strand of biblical teaching that we need to explore. This fifth dimension is
God's conditional love. As soon as I say that word conditional, you might want to protest, “God's love is
conditional? I thought God gives us an unconditional love.”
We Christians do frequently use that term, “unconditional love,” to describe God's grace. That
term is not all bad. We don't want to get into a debate over mere words. On the other hand, the term,
“unconditional love,” can be misleading. Let's admit that the term, “unconditional love,” is not an
expression that comes directly from Scripture itself. In fact, I suspect that the term actually originates
from modern therapeutic psychology.
Be that as it may, let's look at what the Bible says. Look first at what we find in Deuteronomy 7.
We've already seen how verses 7-8 declare God's covenantal love. God decides to set his affection on
Israel. This love does not flow from God because of who they are or because of what they have done.
It is his decision. He decides to claim them as his own. But in verses 11 and following we see another
dimension to God's love.
Therefore, take care to follow the commands, decrees and laws I give you today.
If you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them, then the Lord your God
will keep his covenant of love with you, as he swore to your ancestors. He will love you and
bless you and increase your numbers. (Deut. 7:11-13a)
God establishes his covenant of love with his people, but within that relationship the experience of his
love is conditioned or dependent upon their obedience.
The clearest teaching about God's conditional love comes from Jesus himself. Listen to what
he says to his disciples on the night when he is betrayed.
""As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you keep my
commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's commands and
remain in his love. (John 15:9-10)
We need to be careful with this passage. Jesus is not teaching us that it is through our obedience
that we somehow get into God's love. Jesus is talking about “remaining in” and not “getting in.” You
cannot remain in something unless you are already in it. Jesus is not telling people here how to become 
his disciples. On the contrary, Jesus is talking here to people who are already his disciples. They have
already experienced God's covenantal love. This is Jesus' teaching on how to remain in that love.
Sometimes I have said in sermons that when you become a child of God through faith in Jesus
Christ, God loves you totally. If you are a Christian, then God cannot love you any more than he
already does because he loves you totally the moment you trust in Christ. I stand by that statement.
That is a description of God's covenantal love. Once God claims you as his own, he doesn't have
second thoughts.
Let’s also recognize that love is something that needs to be protected and nourished. We know
that’s true in our human relationships. Love is not static. It’s dynamic. In different situations it is
experienced in different ways.
Think about the way that parents love their child. On the one hand, that love is committed and
unchangeable. No matter what happens those parents are going to provide for their child. Nothing is
going to change that! On the other hand, the child’s experience of that steadfast love is conditional. It
depends upon the child’s obedience. If he or she regularly disobeys, then that child is not going to feel
loved. The parents’ love hasn’t changed, but the experience of the child has changed because it is
dependent upon the child’s obedience.
That’s true in our human relationships, and it is true in our relationship with God as well. God
cannot love a Christian any more than he already does. But it is also true that you and I can experience
more of God's love than we already do. It's not a question of God loving you more, it's a question of you
making yourself more receptive to the totality of God's love. That's God's conditional love.
Someone once pointed out to me that there is no one more miserable than a Christian who is
deliberately living in disobedience to God. That is such an important insight. There is no one more
miserable that a Christian who is deliberately living in disobedience! He or she may enjoy the
pleasures of sin for a time, but it won't last. Why? Because God's claim upon that Christian's life is too
strong for him or her to ever remain content with that sin. On the other hand, that same Christian has
succumbed too much to temptation to be truly happy with God. So what is the result? Misery. There is
no one more miserable than a Christian who is deliberately living in disobedience to God.2
I remember passing that insight along in a sermon years ago. Right after the service a man
came up to me and said, “Fred, you described me exactly. I love God, but I also want to do something
that I know he says is sin. I’m miserable.”
The passing pleasures of sin are tempting, but please don’t settle for some temporary delight.
Aim for that ultimate and never-ending experience of God’s love that comes from obeying God. Listen
again to what Jesus says:
If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have obeyed my Father's
commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that
your joy may be complete. (John 15:10-11)
Do you want to enjoy God's love completely? If there is some ongoing sin in your life that you
are hanging on to, confess it. Repent of it. Turn away from it. Tell God that your desire from now on is
to obey him.
Conclusion
The love of God—there is so much more to this subject than we usually think. Let’s make it our
goal to know God for who he really is. Let’s put aside the two dimensional cartoon character. Let’s go
beyond the clichés that we’ve grown too used to. Let’s understand the full dimensions of God’s love so
that we can experience his love and enjoy his love forever.
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",6/29/2014,
"This morning and next Sunday morning we are going to explore an important but difficult
teaching that we find in the Bible. We’re going to examine what the God’s Word teaches about
God’s love.
You may be wondering if I just said what I meant to say or whether you just heard what
you thought you heard. Did I really say that the Bible’s teaching about God’s love is difficult to
understand?
Yes, that is exactly what I said!
What is it that is so difficult to understand about God's love? Isn’t God’s love easy to
understand compared to so many other Christian doctrines? People get into debates about
things like the Trinity or predestination, but nobody debates God's love. People question
teachings about the wrath of God, but nobody questions that God is loving. People deny the
deity of Christ or even the existence of God himself. But even agnostics acknowledge that if
God exists, then he or she or it must be loving. So what is so difficult about God's love?
Is the doctrine of the love of God really that easy? Let me ask you a few questions. It
is frequently said that ""God's love is unconditional."" You've heard that, haven't you? If God's
love is truly unconditional, does that mean that God loves someone who walks into an
elementary school and kills little children in exactly the same way that he loves a teacher who
tries to protect the school children from such a killer? Does God draw no distinctions between
people based upon their deeds? Is God blind to evil? Is there no relationship between ethics
and love? Is God's love truly unconditional?
We so often say that ""God hates the sin but loves the sinner."" But that saying is
never found in the Bible. In fact, Psalm 5:5 describes God by saying, ""you hate all who do
wrong."" God doesn't just hate the wrong that is done; he hates all those who do wrong.
Psalm 11:5 puts it even stronger: ""The Lord examines the righteous, but the wicked, those
who love violence, he hates with a passion.” So is it right to say that “God hates the sin but
loves the sinner”?
Someone might say, ""Well, that's the Old Testament. The Old Testament God was a
God of wrath, but in the New Testament Jesus teaches us that God is love.” But if that's
true, then why does Jesus himself teach so much about hell? (See Matt. 5:21-22; 10:28; 23:33;
Mk. 9:43-48.) Why does Jesus mention hell more than anybody else in the Bible?
Maybe the Bible’s teaching about the love of God is not as easy to understand as we
so often imagine that it is. Maybe it deserves more careful study than we usually give it. I
think back over all that I have learned about God since I graduated from seminary, and I
would have to rate this study of the love of God as the most surprising and most significant
thing that I have learned over all those years.1
We find in the Bible at least five distinguishable ways that the love of God is revealed
to us. This morning we are going to examine just three of them. God’s Father-Son Love
First, we should note that the Bible mentions what we can call God's Father-Son
love. This is a love between God the Father and Jesus, the Son of God. John 3:35 says,
""The Father loves the Son"" (John 3:35; see also 5:20). God the Father loves his Son, Jesus.
And in John 14:31, Jesus says, ""The world must learn that I love the Father.""
Those two statements may seem unremarkable when you first consider them. God
loves his Son, and his Son, Jesus, loves his heavenly Father. What is so surprising about
that? But can any of us really understand what this love between Jesus and his Father is
like? Jesus is without sin, so this love of the Father for the Son cannot be equated with God's
love for us because we have all sinned and disobeyed God. All human love is tarnished to
some degree by selfishness. We love others but we also hope and want to get something
back from the people that we love. But God’s Father-Son love is a unique and holy kind of
love that is not touched by any sense of sinful selfishness at all. We may have a small idea
of what it is like, but the truth is that it surpasses our limited human ability to comprehend it.
Our minds are simply not big enough to take it all in.
Nevertheless, this Father-Son loves teaches us something important. It teaches us
that God has always been characterized by love. The Father has always loved the Son, and
the Son has always loved the Father. God did not have to create the world in order to find
something that he could love. God loved even before the universe existed. There has never
been a time when God did not love. Even before time began there existed a love between the
Father and the Son. Love is a characteristic of God's essential nature. That in itself should
make us pause and fill us with a sense of awe and mystery.
God’s Providential Love
Think about a second strand of biblical teaching. The Bible teaches us about what
we could call God's providential love. Providence refers to the way that God works in and
rules over every single thing that happens in the universe. The actual word love is not
used so much in this way, but the theme is found all through the Bible.2
 The first chapter
of Genesis says that God looked upon the world that he had created and saw that it was
""very good"" (Gen. 1:31). It was valuable! This world is important to God. It is not an
unjustified stretch to say that God loves his creation.
God rules this world with its good in mind. The Sermon on the Mount includes those
wonderful verses that remind us that God provides for the birds of the air even though they do
not sow or reap or store away in barns (Matt. 6:26); God provides for the lilies of the field even
though they do not labor or spin (Matt. 6:28). Matthew 5:45 applies that idea to the human
realm as well. ""[God] causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the
righteous and the unrighteous."" (See also Acts 14:17.)
Think about the implications of that. God does good and loving things for the evil and
the good, the righteous and the unrighteous. In this sense it is perfectly proper to say that God
loves terrorists as much as he loves those killed by terrorists. God provides both the evil and
the innocent with life and with the sun and with the rain. His provision for their very existence is
evidence of his providential love. It is proper to say that God truly loves every thing and every
person in the world. God’s Saving Love
But we must not stop with God's providential love. We need to think about another
strand of biblical teaching. Think about that famous verse that you have heard quoted so many
times—John 3:16. ""For God so loved the world . . ."" Stop right there! What does John 3:16
mean when it says that God ""loved the world""? Is this another way of describing God's
providential love?
It all depends upon what John means by world. Is he talking about creation, or does he
mean something else when he uses that word? Think about the way that world is used in the
Gospel of John. John 15:18-19 also use the word world. Each time world is used in those
verses, it is used negatively.
If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the
world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have
chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. (John 15:18-19,
emphasis added)
In those verses the world is described as hating Jesus and his disciples. The world is
something that Jesus’ disciples need to be rescued from. That is true for the entire Gospel of
John. The world refers not to creation but to something negative and evil within God’s
creation. In John world refers to sinful and rebellious humanity.
In John 3:16 the amazing thing is not that God loved a world that is so big. No, John's
amazement is that God decided to love the world that is so bad! God decided to love a world
that is in rebellion against him. Isn't that astounding? We can understand why God loves his
creation because he declared that it was “very good,” but why does God love people who have
deliberately rejected him?
In John 3:16 we find another strand of the biblical teaching about God's love. This is
God's saving love. It is with this aspect of God's love that sin and rebellion and disobedience
become a central issue.
We have to add that this love unlike God's providential love calls for a response. ""For
God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall
not perish but have eternal life"" (John 3:16, emphasis added). God's providential love is for all
people regardless of how they respond to God. It's for the victims of the terrorist and for the
terrorist too. But God's saving love calls for people to respond to Jesus and to believe in him.
There’s something more that we need to understand about God’s saving love. It’s not
just that this love calls for a response. God’s saving love is an emotional love. It is a yearning
of God's heart. God warns us about the consequences of sin, and then he God pleads with us
to repent of our sins and to put our trust in his Son Jesus.
I think of the prophet Ezekiel's plea with his people. ""As surely as I live, declares the
sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their
ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways! Why will you die, 0 house of Israel?” (Ezek.
33:11). In the New Testament we read the apostle Paul’s summary of his message. “We are
therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We
implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God” (2 Cor. 5:20).
Those are emotional words. If we don’t hear and feel that emotion, then we are not
doing justice to the saving love of God. Picture someone walking in front of a speeding car. 
You yell as quickly and as loudly as you, “Stop! Watch out! Don’t go any farther!” That’s what
God says to all of us as we walk away from him. “Stop! Turn back! Turn away from your evil
ways. Turn back to me!” God loves us sinful people. He sent his Son Jesus to die on the
cross and take the punishment for our sins. Then he implores and pleads and begs us to turn
back to him in repentance and faith.
Conclusions
There are two other dimensions to the biblical teaching about God's love, and next
week we'll look at them. But let’s stop for this morning and think about what we have
learned so far.
Here are three quick conclusions that come out of this morning's study. First, we
must learn to evaluate everything according to God's Word. In our society today a vague idea
about God’s love is so common that it is easily neglected or simply dismissed. “God loves
me? Well, of course, he does. That’s his job! What else is new?”
Never has there been a time when we Christians need to think more carefully about
the way that God’s love is described. In the Bible God’s love is never presented as something
that we can take for granted. We need to evaluate everything to see if it is true to what God’s
Word actually teaches.
That includes the things that we have heard since our childhood. ""God hates the sin
and loves the sinner."" That statement is close to the truth, but it can be misleading.
Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that God hates the sin and longs for sinners to repent of
their sins and trust in his Son Jesus? That is not nearly as catchy or memorable, but that is
what the Bible actually teaches.
Second, we have to distinguish between the different ways that the Bible speaks of
God's love. We must do that! Suppose that we were to take the idea of God's providential
love and make that the only way that you think about God's love. If you did that, then you be
falling into a serious error. God's providential love does not require a response. “God
causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the
unrighteous”—regardless of how they respond. But God's saving love does call for a
response. Forgiveness and heaven are not automatic. We must not think that they are.
That leads me to the third and most important lesson in this study. You and I as
individuals need to be sure that we have responded to God’s saving love. Please do not
take the Bible’s teaching about God’s love and receive it with a yawn or a shrug of the
shoulders! You and I need to respond! Forgiveness and heaven are not automatic. That
idea is so common in our culture today, but it’s wrong. It is not what the Bible says. If you
have not deliberately and consciously entrusted your life to Jesus Christ, please do so
today!
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",6/22/2014,
"This morning I am going to begin with a frank acknowledgement. I became a Christian when
I was sixteen years old. That’s when I trusted in Jesus as my Lord and my Savior. For a number of
years after my conversion I didn’t like the Lord’s Prayer. (That may be putting it a bit too strongly.)
The Lord’s Prayer just didn’t do anything for me. I didn’t really understand it, and I didn’t pray it—
except when I was at church and everybody was reciting it together.
Here’s why I had problems with the Lord’s Prayer. Maybe some of you have had these same
problems. First, the Lord’s Prayer used the word hallowed. “Hallowed be thy name.” How often do
you use the word hallowed? Is that part of your normal everyday vocabulary? Do you use it at any
other time than when you are reciting the Lord’s Prayer? Neither do I. Hallowed is an old English
word that doesn’t immediately communicate to me.
My second problem with the Lord’s Prayer is that there are two versions of it in the New
Testament. We find one version in the Gospel of Matthew and a slightly different one in the Gospel of
Luke. Why did Jesus give his disciples two different versions? Which one are we supposed to use?
I had one more problem with the Lord’s Prayer. I grew up in a church where we asked God
to “forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.” But after coming to Christ and experiencing his
love, I started attending churches where we asked God to “forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
those who have trespassed against us.” That was really confusing! For one thing, nobody owed me
any money so I didn’t have any debtors to forgive. I didn’t own any property either so nobody was
ever guilty of trespassing against me.
The basic problem was that nobody had every explained the Lord’s Prayer to me. I knew the
Lord’s Prayer, but I had never thought about it. Nobody had ever encouraged me to do that. The
Lord’s Prayer was not something that you thought about. You just recited it and then moved on to
the next thing in the worship service.
This morning I want to explain the Lord’s Prayer to you, but, more than that, I want to
encourage you to use the Lord’s Prayer. That’s why Jesus gave it to his disciples. He wanted to
teach them how to pray. The Lord’s Prayer is not something that should be mindlessly recited. It’s a
prayer designed to be used!
We need to remember that Jesus was an itinerant preacher. So he taught this prayer
numerous times to various gatherings of his disciples. Sometimes he stated it one way, and the
next time he put it a little differently. The two versions of it that we have in the New Testament show
that Jesus was not really concerned about the exact wording. Jesus meant this prayer to be a
model. We don’t have to recite every single word of it in exactly the same way. We need to follow
its general direction.
I think back to when I finally ""discovered"" the Lord's Prayer. Instead of it being a dull
recitation of words, suddenly this prayer came alive. I found it helped me pray. This prayer is
particularly helpful to me when I feel rushed and feel like I don't have enough time to pray. I’ve also
found it useful when I’m praying for someone else but am not quite sure what I should be praying for
that person. The Lord’s Prayer reminds me of the most important things to talk to God about.
God’s Honor
The prayer starts, of course, with ""Father, hallowed be your name"" (Lk. 11:2b). Even our
modern translations of the Bible still use the word hallowed. It is such an established part of the
Lord’s Prayer that even modern translations don’t dare get rid of it.
How would you put this first request in the Lord’s Prayer into your own words? Here’s how I
would do it. ""Father, I pray that you will be honored."" The word hallow means to ""make holy"" or to
""recognize as holy."" A fairly close modern equivalent to that term could be ""honor."" ""Father, I pray
that you will be honored."" That's a good way to start your prayers. ""God, the thing that I want more
than anything else is for you to receive the honor that you really deserve."" The first request in the
Lord’s Prayer is for God’s honor.
When you stop to think about it, that's a radical thing to say in our culture. ""God, the thing
that I want more than anything else is for you to receive the honor that you really deserve."" That's
not the way that most people think today. For most people in modern America the most important
thing is not God's honor but their happiness. How many times have you ever heard somebody
explain his or her actions by saying, ""Well, I have a right to be happy!""
I came across an interview a number of years ago. I still remember it. The question was
asked: ""Do pastors face more difficult problems today than in previous generations?"" Here's how
the man being interviewed responded.
. . . the main difference today is not how much people are hurting, but how much they expect
to be relieved from their hurting. The previous century suffered just as much; in fact,
probably much more. Just think of all the illness, death in childbirth, infant mortality, plagues.
The big difference today is that we have this mentality that if it's wrong, you can fix it. You
don't have to live with any discomfort or frustration. And the pastor is in the front line of
people who get approached: ""Make me happy. Make me feel good.""
1
That is the cultural climate in which we live.
With this prayer Jesus is instructing us that we need to reorient our entire approach to life.
""Father, what I want most is that you will be honored--even if it doesn't make me happy."" Think
about what that might mean.
Think about that famous story in the Old Testament book of Daniel. King Nebuchadnezzar is
going to throw the three young men into the fiery furnace unless they renounce their faith in the
living God. If there was ever a time for someone to pray for their own well-being, that was it! Do you
remember what they said to the king? ""The God we serve is able to save us . . . But even if he does
not, we want you to know, Your Majesty, that we will not serve your gods . . ."" (Dan. 3:17-18).
That's the mentality behind this prayer that Jesus teaches us to pray. ""Father, I pray that you
will be honored. More than my happiness, I want you to be honored.""
I mentioned earlier that the Lord’s Prayer is a prayer to be used. So let's do that right now.
Think of some situation that you are facing. Think about something in your life about which you're
not happy. Now I'd like you to bow your head and pray. Follow Jesus'model. Tell God that in that
situation you want him to be honored. Will you do that? Will you tell him that you want that even
more than you want your own happiness?
God’s Purposes
The second request in the prayer is for God's purposes. ""Your kingdom come,"" Jesus says
(Lk. 11:2c). Think about what that means. On the one hand, it refers to a literal kingdom. When you
pray for God's kingdom to come, you are praying that Jesus will come again and rule over the earth.
The early Christians prayed for that. They prayed a very short prayer. It went like this:
""Maranatha"" (1 Cor. 16:22). That was the whole prayer. Maranatha! It's an Aramaic expression
meaning ""O Lord, come."" We should pray that way too. We should ask Jesus to come soon. ""Lord,
we're looking forward to that time when your rule is unquestioned and when evil has been
vanquished and all sin is abolished. Lord Jesus, come soon and establish your kingdom."" That's
part of what is behind this request. But we should also think of this request in terms of God's rule over us as individuals. That's
why I'd summarize this request this way: ""Father, I pray that your purposes will be accomplished.""
That's a good thing to pray at the beginning of the day. ""God, here is what I am planning on
getting done today. I'm planning on going to work, and then I'm going to come home and go
fishing."" ""God, my plan today is to get all the laundry done, and then I'm going to go to bed early
and catch up on my sleep.""
""Oh, but God, if you've got something else in mind for me today, I want your purposes to be
accomplished most of all. If somebody needs my help so that I can't get out on the lake or can't get
to bed early, well, that's OK, God. I want your purposes to come first.""
Would you be willing to pray that way right now? Take your plans for this afternoon or
tomorrow or this week, and give them to God. Tell him you are willing to set them aside if
necessary. Tell him that you want his purposes to be accomplished most of all.
Our Physical Needs
When we come to the third request, we notice a shift. The first two requests are for God's
honor and God's purposes. Now we turn to our needs, and Jesus begins with our physical needs.
""Give us each day our daily bread"" (Lk. 11:3). We know that line well. Here's how I'd put it in
different terms: ""Father, I pray that you will give me what I need.""
The very fact that Jesus includes that request in his model prayer should encourage us. Our
Father does care about us. There's nothing wrong with us telling God what we need and asking him
to give it to us. We don't have to be embarrassed or hesitant about bringing our smallest concerns
to him. ""God, here is what I need! Please give it to me.""
We should note, however, that Jesus tells us to pray for our daily bread and not for a
luxurious feast. We're not to demand that God grant us all of our wishes and then get upset if he
doesn't. We're to pray to God about our needs. I've even thought that maybe this request should be
put this way: ""Father, I pray that you will give me what you know that I need.""
God does care about our needs. He wants us to pray about them. He wants to hear our
requests for the things that we really need. So let's pray about some of those needs right now. Let's
all bow our heads. Tell God what you think is your biggest need, and ask him to give it to you.
Our Spiritual Needs
Luke 11:4 is the fourth and final request. Here Jesus is telling us to pray about our spiritual
needs. There are two parts to it. ""Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against
us"" (Lk. 11:4a). That’s the way that the New International Version puts it, but that’s not the way that
we recite it, is it? This is the place in the prayer where we get into the mess that I mentioned earlier
with “debts” and “trespasses.”
Here is a quick explanation. Almost all of our English translations of the Bible say “debts”
and not “trespasses.”
2 That’s because it is the best translation of the Greek term. So where did
“trespasses” come from? Have you ever heard of the Book of Common Prayer? It was a book
written for use in the worship services of the Anglican Church, and it was written in 1549. That book
continues to shape the worship terminology of English speaking Christians. The Book of Common
Prayer used the word “trespasses” in its version of the Lord’s Prayer. That’s the reason why so
many of us still today ask God to “forgive us our trespasses.” It all goes back to the Book of
Common Prayer. It actually doesn’t make much difference whether we use “debts” or” trespasses.” Jesus is
giving us a metaphor or illustration for sin and disobedience. So here’s how I use this part of the
Lord’s prayer: ""Father, I pray that you will forgive me. (And please make me a forgiving person
too!).""
There's a prayer request that I find I always need. There's not a day that goes by that I don't
have to ask God for his forgiveness. If it isn't something that is outwardly wrong, then it's in my
thoughts or desires. ""Father, I pray that you will forgive me.""
The best test of whether we truly desire forgiveness is found in our willingness to forgive
others. A forgiven person is a forgiving person. So there comes that additional part. ""Please make
me a forgiving person too.""
Have you ever enjoyed being angry at someone? There is a certain pleasure that can come
from anger, isn't there? You feel morally superior to that other person because he or she did such a
rotten thing to you. Anger can also give you a delicious feeling of control over that other person.
Maybe you're not actually going to do something to that person, but you feel like you at least have
the right to think about doing it to that person. Just that thought brings with it a certain kind of
perverse pleasure.
Jesus knows that we need to pray about that! ""Father, I pray that you will forgive me. (And
please make me a forgiving person too!)"" Do you need to pray that prayer? Let's bow our heads
once again and pray.
* * * * *
Jesus gives us a second spiritual need to pray about. ""And lead us not into temptation"" (Lk.
11:4b). Jesus puts it negatively. I've chosen to put it positively. ""Father, I pray that you will give me
the strength to keep on living for you.""
With this final request comes the honest recognition that putting God's honor and God's
purposes first is not easy. Being satisfied when our needs are met instead of all our wants—that
doesn't come naturally either. Dealing with sin through confession and forgiveness—that can be
even harder! That's why we need this final request so much. “Father, I pray that you will give me
the strength to keep on living for you.”
Do you ever need to make that request to God? This final prayer is a simple declaration that
we need God. ""God, I can't make it without you. God, sometimes I get so tired of trying to live for
you. Please God. If I'm going to make it, you have got to be at work in my life.""
Do you ever feel that way? How about telling God about it right now?
* * * * *
There is the model that Jesus gives us for prayer.
4 Pray for God's honor and God's
purposes. Feel free to tell God about your physical needs. Remember to pray that God will meet
your spiritual needs too.
What do you think would happen if you prayed this prayer every morning for the next week?
Will you try that as an experiment? I don't mean just recite the words. What if you took a few
minutes to think about this prayer and then put the requests into your own words? Take this prayer
as your model. Use it! And then see what God will do!",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",6/15/2014,
"There are few things that are more difficult to live with than uncertainty. I think particularly of
people who are sick, but who don’t know what it is that is wrong with them. They’ve been to doctor
after doctor and had test after test, but none of the doctors or tests have been able to identify what’s
wrong. So often those people have said to me, “Pastor Fred, if I could just know what it is that’s
wrong with me, this would be so much easier to live with!” Then if they do find out the name of the
disease—even if they learn that it is a chronic or life-threatening illness, there is a sense of relief.
“At least, I finally know what it is that I am facing.”
Uncertainty! It makes life so difficult.
In one sense, of course, all of life is uncertain. You and I cannot be sure of anything as long
as we live here on earth. There are no guarantees when it comes to our health or our jobs or our
children or our church or our relationships with others. We all have to learn to live with uncertainty.
But as believers in Jesus Christ, there is something—rather Someone—that we can count on and be
certain of.
The Conviction
We learn about that Person in Psalm 62. I love this psalm. I’ve preached on it before, and I
am always glad to preach on it again. I need this psalm. Out of 150 psalms in the Old Testament,
this one is my favorite! I love every part of this poem that King David wrote. I love the way it starts.
1 Truly my soul finds rest in God;
my salvation comes from him.
2 Truly he is my rock and my salvation;
he is my fortress, I will never be shaken. (Ps. 62:1-2)
I love those words. I love the first word that David uses in both of those verses. It’s the
Hebrew word ‘ak. David uses it at the beginning of verse 1 and verse 2, and he uses it four more
times in this psalm.
It’s such an intriguing word. If you check out our English translations of the Bible, you’ll find
that the word is translated in a variety of ways. The KJV or King James Version translates it as
“truly.” The ESV or English Standard Version translates it as “alone.” The NASB or New American
Standard Bible translates it as “only.” All of those translations are good, but none of them are
absolutely right.
Here’s why. The Hebrew word, ‘ak, doesn’t really mean anything at all. I know that sounds
strange, but it’s true. The word, ‘ak, is what is called an emphatic particle. That means that it is an
expression used to convey emphasis and emotion, not meaning.
1
It’s like our word “yeah!” We hear
that expression all the time in our culture, but, if you stop to think about it, it doesn’t actually inform
you of any fact. Instead, it expresses strong feelings. That’s what this Hebrew word in Psalm 62
does too.
One night this week I woke up and had a hard time getting back to sleep. I found myself
thinking about ‘ak. I know that’s hard to believe, but it’s true. Then I started to think about Wycliffe
Bible Translators. As I hope you know, the ministry of Wycliffe is to translate the Bible so that
people all around the world can read and understand the Bible in their own language. It is so good
and healthy to be able to read God’s Word in the language that you are most familiar with.
So there I was lying in bed, and I imagined that Wycliffe Bible Translators had identified a
people group here in North America that does not have the Bible in their own language. That
particular people group lives in a remote area of the continent known as Minnesota. They speak a
language called Minnesotan. So Wycliffe produces a new translation for those people. It’s called the MSV or the Minnesotan Standard Version. In that translation of the Bible, Psalm 62:1-2 reads
like this:
My soul finds rest in God—ya, sure, you betcha!
My salvation comes from him.
He is my rock and my salvation—ya, sure, you betcha!
He is my fortress, I will never be shaken.
Do you get the idea behind this word ‘ak? Can you trust God, you Minnesotans? Answer
that question with me. “Ya, sure, you betcha!”
Psalm 62 divides into five neat sections. Verses 1 and 2 make up the first section. Here
David is expressing his conviction. Here is what he has learned that he can count on in this life. He
can count on God. There are no guarantees about anything else. But he can count on God!
That’s true for all of us who are believers in Jesus Christ. Our Heavenly Father has
promised us that he will never leave us or forsake us (Heb. 13:5). Think of some problem that you
are facing right now. Maybe it is huge and overwhelming, or maybe it is small but relentless. It
keeps eating away at you. Take Psalm 62 and apply it to that problem that you are in the midst of.
Truly—in this situation!—my soul finds rest in God;
My salvation will come from him.
Truly—with this particular problem!—he is my rock and my salvation;
He is my fortress, I will never be shaken.
Memorize these first two verses of Psalm 62. When doubts and fears attack you this week,
repeat them to yourself. “Truly my soul finds rest in God. Truly he is my rock and my salvation.”
The Problem
Look now at what David says in verses 3 and 4. He discusses the problem that he is facing
when he writes this psalm, and I am so glad that he does. David does not make it appear that
trusting God makes all your problems magically disappear so that you never even have to think
about them again. Listen to David as he opens up about his problem.
3 How long will you assault me?
Would all of you throw me down—
this leaning wall, this tottering fence? (Ps. 62:3)
David feels so weak. He’s like an old fence. If someone just barely leans on it, it will fall over right
away.
4 Surely they intend to topple me
from my lofty place;
they take delight in lies.
With their mouths they bless,
but in their hearts they curse. (Ps. 62:4)
Isn't it interesting that David's problem is with people? Some of the most difficult problems
that we ever face are the ones that involve other people. Isn’t that true in your experience? I don’t
want to underestimate the fear that can seize us with an unexpected illness or a tragic accident.
But aren't the problems that seem to persist the longest and cause the greatest turmoil within you
the ones that come from other people?
I like reading biographies. I like reading good biographies, the ones that present the person
as a real flesh-and-blood human being. A number of years ago I read a really good biography of
Hudson Taylor, the man who was used by God in such a remarkable way to take the good news of
Jesus Christ to China. In reading that biography, I grew in my admiration for Hudson Taylor and his
faith, but I also learned just how human he was.
Early in his career he was accused by one of his co-workers of having improper relationships
with some of the young female workers in China. Even after those accusations were all refuted, that
man kept spreading those rumors around.
2
It caused Hudson Taylor a lot of turmoil and stress. Later
in his career Taylor was accused of taking advantage of his leadership position. Thirty of the workers
in China resigned, and those complaints about his leadership plagued him for the rest of his life.
3
Trusting in God like David and Hudson Taylor did does not guarantee you a trouble-free
existence. So don’t be surprised. There will be problems.
The Sermon
So what should we do when we face problems with other people or some kind of other
problem? Look at what David does. The third section of this psalm could be titled the sermon
because David, in effect, preaches to himself. He takes the message of verses 1 and 2 and applies
them directly to himself.
5 Yes, my soul, find rest in God;
my hope comes from him.
6 Truly he is my rock and my salvation;
he is my fortress, I will not be shaken.
7 My salvation and my honor depend on God;
he is my mighty rock, my refuge. (Ps. 62:5-7)
David is talking to himself in those verses. That’s particularly true in verse 5 where he uses that
emphatic Hebrew particle that I mentioned earlier. “Yes, David! Look to God and find your rest in him.”
Do you ever need to preach to yourself that way? I know that I do at times. “Fred, you say
that you believe in God. You preach on Sundays that God is sufficient for every situation. Well, now
it’s time for you to put it into practice!” I do need to preach sermons like that to myself. That’s what
David is doing in verse 5.
In verse 8 David goes beyond giving us his example. He has an instruction aimed
specifically at you and me.
8 Trust in him at all times, you people;
pour out your hearts to him,
for God is our refuge. (Ps. 62:8)
That verse is one of my favorite parts in this psalm. ""Pour out your hearts to him."" Pour
them out! Don't keep your problems to yourself. Don't pretend that you can handle everything by
yourself. Tell God about your worries and your fears. Don't do that hesitantly or half-heartedly.
Don't let your troubles just leak or dribble out. Dump them! Dump all your problems on God! That's
what David is telling us to do. ""Pour out your hearts to him."" Do you feel the emotion behind that
instruction? Whatever you feel, you can tell God. God can handle anything you throw his way. So
tell him what you're thinking and tell him what you're feeling.
Don’t just pray by yourself. Get some other people to pray with you.
This morning we are starting a new ministry here in our church, and I am so happy to tell you
about it. It is such a simple but important ministry. After every worship service there will be some
people available to pray with anybody about anything. Those people will be standing over here in
what we are calling our Prayer Corner. If you would like them to pray with you about something, just
come over and ask them. That’s what they are here for. Your prayer request can be large or small.
They will keep what you tell them confidential. They will not try to offer you advice because that is
not their job. They are not counselors. They will simply sit down with you and pray with you.
The Warning
The fourth section of this psalm contains a warning. Once again I appreciate David’s
realism. When things get bad, we are often tempted to do something a little underhanded. We think
about taking a few shortcuts to solve the problem. Maybe you’ll toy with the idea of doing something
to get back at the people who are doing evil to you. David says, ""Don't do that! Remember!""  Surely the lowborn are but a breath,
the highborn are but a lie.
If weighed on a balance, they are nothing;
together they are only a breath.
10 Do not trust in extortion
or put vain hope in stolen goods;
though your riches increase,
do not set your heart on them. (Ps. 62:9-10)
Don't do what you see other people doing. If they're angry and spreading falsehoods about
you, don't you do the same to them. Maybe you're tempted to flatter someone so that you can be on
their good side. Don't follow that route either. And don’t fall for the idea that money will solve all
your problems, so you’re going to make it your aim to get more money no matter what it takes. That
may help you for a while, but it will backfire on you. Don’t start down that path!
Think about the news that has come out over the last few weeks about the Veterans
Administration. Veterans who needed medical help were put on secret waiting lists, but it was
covered up to make it look like they were receiving prompt service. Worse yet the officials who were
behind it were given bonuses because it looked like they were doing their job so well. And it
worked!—for a while. But now it’s catching up with them.
Let that be a lesson to us all. No matter how tempting it is to take shortcuts and avoid
dealing with sin, keep on trusting God by doing what you know is right.
The Promise
That brings us to the concluding section of the psalm. I'd title this fifth section the promise.
David begins, ""One thing God has spoken, two things have I heard."" What does that mean? David
is using a rhetorical device.
I can still hear my mother saying to me years ago, ""Fred, if I've told once, I've told you a
thousand times!"" Even at a young age and before I had ever heard of rhetorical devices, I knew that
she was not trying to give me a math lesson!
This is David's way of saying that there are two important truths about God that he has
learned.
11 One thing God has spoken,
two things I have heard:
“Power belongs to you, God,
12
and with you, Lord, is unfailing love”;
and, “You reward everyone
according to what they have done.” (Ps. 62:11-12)
If you're a child of God through faith in Jesus Christ, God makes this promise to you. He will
be strong and loving on your behalf. You can bank on that. And justice will be done. God will not
ignore you or overlook you the way that you have lived for him.
Oh, it might look at times like God has turned a blind eye to your needs. You might think that
he's gone on vacation and that he doesn't have the slightest awareness of how you are seeking to
live for him. There are times in the Christian life when it appears that God is doing wonderful things
for other people but that he's not doing one thing for you. Don’t be surprised if that happens to you.
Listen to David! He's saying, ""If there's one thing that I've learned—if I were to take all that
I've learned about God and condense it, here's what I'd say, ‘God is for his people. He does not
ignore them. His ways are often mysterious, but he will be with you through your toughest time.
You can find your rest in him.’”
Ya, sure, you betcha!
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",6/8/2014,
"This week a couple of things took place that forced me to do some hard thinking. The
first thing was just an article that I came across. It was titled, “What I Wish I’d Known:
Reflections on Nearly 40 Years of Pastoral Ministry.”
1 Here’s one of the things that the author
wishes he had known when he first began his ministry: “I wish I had known . . . that most
Christians (including pastors) are convinced God is either angry or disgusted with them, or both.
I wish I’d known earlier how much [God] enjoys singing over them (and over me).”
When this pastor talks about God singing over his people, he is referring to a passage in
the Old Testament.
The LORD your God is with you,
the Mighty Warrior who saves.
He will take great delight in you;
in his love he will no longer rebuke you,
but will rejoice over you with singing.” (Zeph 3:17)
God delights in his people. If you are a child of God through faith in Jesus Christ, God sings
over you with joy. This pastor says that most Christians are not truly convinced of that and they
need to be assured of God’s delight in them.
Here’s the second thing that occurred this week that spurred my thinking. I talked to a
pastor who lives in another part of Minnesota. He told me about an individual in his church who
gets up and walks out of the sermon if this pastor ever says anything about working harder at
becoming a devoted follower of Jesus Christ. “Just preach grace!” That’s what this individual
tells the pastor. “Just preach God’s love and nothing more!”
I’ve heard that kind of thing before. In fact, I hear it fairly often. The idea is that if
Christians can simply grasp how much God loves them, then they will naturally want to live for
God. If believers in Christ are not living godly lives, then the root problem is that they have not
understood and internalized what Christ did for them when he died on the cross. So the most
pressing need in the church today is to preach and preach and then preach again the love and
grace of God!
Is that right? What do you think?
Here’s the question: What do we as believers in Christ really need? Is it just the
assurance of God’s gift of love? Or are there times when we also need to be challenged to live
more consistently for God? Are there times when we even need to be rebuked? To put it in
blunt everyday terms: What do we need more—a pat on the back or a kick in the pants?
We are going to explore that issue this morning as we bring our study of 2 Corinthians to
a close. 2 Corinthians 13 is not one of the most exciting sections of the Bible. Until this week I
had never really spent a lot of time studying this passage or thinking about what it says. When I
first read it this week, I wondered what I would say about this final part of Paul’s letter.
One of the good things about preaching straight through a book of the Bible is that you
are forced to study passages that do not immediately attract you. 2 Corinthians 13 is a part of
God’s inspired Word. God put it in his Bible for a purpose. So we need to read it and
understand it and then apply it to our lives. We can’t just skip over it and get to the “good parts”
of the Bible. So often when you take the time to study these parts of the Bible that do not immediately interest you, you discover more than you thought you would. That’s what
happened to me this week as I was studying 2 Corinthians 13.
A Place for Authority
One of the surprising parts of this chapter is how the apostle Paul stresses the exercise
of authority.
1This will be my third visit to you. “Every matter must be established by the
testimony of two or three witnesses.”
2
I already gave you a warning when I was with you
the second time. I now repeat it while absent: On my return I will not spare those who
sinned earlier or any of the others,
3
since you are demanding proof that Christ is
speaking through me. (2 Cor. 13:1-3a)
Those are strong words! Paul obviously believes that there is a place for authority within
the church of Jesus Christ. In verse 1 he quotes from the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy.
“Every matter must be established by the testimony of two or there witnesses” (Deut. 19:15).
Paul draws a comparison between his visits to the city of Corinth and the requirement for two or
three witnesses in a court of law. In effect, he’s saying, “This will be my third visit with you. If I
witness the same thing this time that I’ve seen on my two previous visits, I will address those
sinful problems in no uncertain terms!”
Notice how Paul grounds that approach in the death and life of Jesus himself. “Think
about Jesus,” Paul says.
He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.
4 For to be sure, he was
crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God’s power. Likewise, we are weak in him, yet by
God’s power we will live with him in our dealing with you. (2 Cor. 13:3b-4)
To understand Jesus fully you need to understand his sacrificial death on the cross. But you also
need to understand his resurrection from the dead. Jesus died and rose again! He is now the Lord!
Sometimes we use the word Lord too quickly and too frequently. What does it mean that
Jesus is Lord? In the first century Lord was the word used to describe the Roman Emperor. It
was an expression of his supremacy and power and rule. To say that that Jesus is Lord means
first that he possesses greater authority than the Roman Emperor or any other political figure. It
also means that he is the Ruler of our lives. He is the Master—the Boss. He is the Authority!
Within his church Jesus grants authority to others. The leaders of the church occupy a
position of authority (Heb. 13:17), and to some extent all of us have a degree of authority over
each other. I think of Matthew 18:15. Jesus says, “If your brother or sister sins, go and point
out their fault.” We need each other. We need to be willing to go and talk to each other if we
see a pattern of behavior that is not pleasing to God. And when someone comes to us about
that kind of thing, we need to be willing to listen. There is a place for authority.
The Purpose of Authority
But let’s also be sure that we understand the purpose of authority. Paul explains that
later in this passage. “This is why I write these things when I am absent, that when I come I
may not have to be harsh in my use of authority—the authority the Lord gave me for building
you up, not for tearing you down” (2 Cor. 13:10).
There’s nothing difficult about that statement, is there? The purpose behind spiritual
authority is to build each other up. God is not saying that we should become busybodies
constantly on the lookout to see if we can catch each other doing something wrong. May God
spare us from that kind of suffocating superiority! The purpose is to build each other up and to
encourage each other in our daily lives with God.
Don’t try catching somebody doing something wrong. Try catching someone doing
something right! Then go and thank them for what they’re doing.
The Practice of Authority
There is a place for authority. We need to remember the purpose of authority. But we
also need to consider carefully the practice of authority. This is the most important lesson that
we need to learn.
Paul writes about his authority as an apostle at the end of 2 Corinthians, not at the
beginning. That’s worth noting. At the beginning of his letter he writes about his own
weakness. In chapter 2 he forgives someone in Corinth who has accused him of wrongdoing.
In chapter 4 he compares our Christian lives to a jar of clay that can be easily broken. In
chapter 7 he rejoices at the repentance he’s seen in the Corinthian church. In chapter 12 we
find God saying to Paul, “My grace is sufficient for you. My power is made perfect in
weakness.” The first 12 chapters of this letter are full of expressions of weakness and humility.
It’s only at the very end of this letter that Paul brings up the subject of authority. In effect, Paul
says, “I don’t really want to—this is not my preferred way of dealing with problems, but, if
necessary, I will exercise the authority that the Lord Jesus Christ has given me.”
That brings us back to the question that we began with. What do you and I need more—
a pat on the back or a kick in the pants? The answer is that it all depends upon the person and
the circumstances. We all need the assurance of God’s love because life so often drags us
down. In some situations there is a need for a huge dose of assurance and encouragement. I
think of people who have been raised in unhealthy homes and have never heard anybody say,
“I love you.” They need to be told repeatedly, “Yes, God really does love you. He cares about
every aspect of your life.”
I think of times when someone has come to me and confessed a sin and expressed
heartfelt regret and a genuine desire for repentance. What do I say in response? In those
situations I like to turn to the Old Testament book of Micah. There is a verse in chapter 7 that I
love to quote.
Who is a God like you,
who pardons sin and forgives the transgression
of the remnant of his inheritance?
You do not stay angry forever
but delight to show mercy. (Micah 7:18)
Did you catch that last line? God “delights to show mercy.”
What happens when someone first comes to Christ and admits his or her need for
forgiveness and then decides to trust in Jesus as Lord? What happens when someone who is a
believer in Jesus wanders far away from Christ and then returns to the Lord? How does God
respond? Does he fold his arms and stroke his chin when he hears that person asking for
forgiveness? “Oh, I don’t know. I’d like to see you grovel in the dirt a while longer. I hear your
confession of what you’ve done wrong. I know that you feel bad. But I’m not ready to forgive you
yet. Come back tomorrow and maybe I’ll be in a more forgiving mood.” Is that how God responds?
No! God says to that person who has turned in faith to his Son Jesus or who has
confessed and renounced an ongoing sin, “This is what I have been waiting for! You have
made my day! I delight—I take great joy—in showing you mercy! Will I forgive you? Of course,
there is nothing that I would rather do!”
How’s that for a pat on the back?
But there are also times when we need a kick in the pants. There are times when what
we need is for someone to come to us and look us right in the face and say, “I understand your
temptation because I am tempted too. And I understand how hard it is to break this pattern of
sin that you have gotten yourself into because I’ve struggled and I still struggle against sinful
habits. But I also need to tell you that what you are doing is wrong. It’s wrong! It’s sin! Please
don’t make excuses. Please don’t rationalize it and make it sound as if it is not anything
important. What you are doing is not pleasing to God! And what you need to do is to admit to
God that you are not obeying him. You need to confess your sin and then tell God that you
want to change and that you plan to change. After you make that confession, you will need to
ask God everyday to help you. There will probably be times when you fall back into that sinful
habit. (At least, that’s been my experience.) Then you will need to confess it again and ask for
God’s forgiveness again. It will probably take time and a lot of work, but God can help you
make that change that you need to make.”
We should never enjoy delivering a message like that. But sometimes we do need to do
so.
We need to speak that way not just to others but also to ourselves. Look at what Paul
says to the Corinthians. He is direct. He pulls no punches. “Examine yourselves to see
whether you are in the faith; test yourselves. Do you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you—
unless, of course, you fail the test?” (2 Cor. 13:5). In that verse Paul is not asking whether the
Corinthians have every prayed what we so often call The Sinner’s Prayer. He’s not wondering if
they have trusted in Christ as their Savior. He’s really asking whether their lives are a reflection
of what they say that they believe. The Bible paraphrase called The Message captures the idea
well.
Test yourselves to make sure you are solid in the faith. Don’t drift along taking
everything for granted. Give yourselves regular checkups. You need firsthand evidence,
not mere hearsay, that Jesus Christ is in you. Test it out. If you fail the test, do
something about it.
That applies to all of us, doesn’t it? Don’t we all need a kick in the pants at times? I
know that I do. Maybe our problem is not some clear identifiable sin. Our problem is what
could be called comfortable complacency. That can be just as hazardous to our spiritual health
as some unmistakable sinful act. All of us need to examine ourselves to see if we have
succumbed to spiritual lethargy.
Let me leave you this morning with that thought. Are you and I slipping into
complacency? No one else is probably aware of it. We’re not even all that aware of it. Our
outward lives still look good to others. We still come to church, but it’s not as important as it
once was. We still pray, but not as often as we used to. We still maintain that the Bible is God’s
Word, but our Bibles seem to spend most of their time on the shelf instead of in our laps. Are
you slipping into a comfortable complacency?
One of the most telling comments that I have ever found on the Christian life comes from
C.S. Lewis. You’ve probably heard me quote it before. No doubt you will hear me say it again
sometime. In his book, Mere Christianity, Lewis writes, “. . . if you examined a hundred people
who had lost their faith in Christianity, I wonder how many of them would turn out to have been
reasoned out of it by honest argument? Do not most people simply drift away?”
2
Test yourselves to make sure you are solid in the faith. Don’t drift along taking
everything for granted. Give yourselves regular checkups. . . . If you fail the test, do
something about it.
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",6/1/2014,
"For the last five months I have been looking for an opportunity to tell you something, and
today is the day! Back in January there was an article in Christianity Today magazine that told about
a fascinating, surprising, and encouraging discovery. I want to tell you about this discovery at some
length. The article was titled, “The Surprising Discovery About Those Colonialist, Proselytizing
Missionaries.”
(As I explained a few weeks ago, we no longer use the word missionary in our church
because in various parts of the world it can put the people that we support in danger. Now we use
the term global partners. But in this sermon I am going to use the m-word because we are talking
about people in the past, and they were known as missionaries.)
In literature and movies and in our culture at large missionaries are so often portrayed
negatively. They were people who were culturally insensitive if not downright racist. They were
usually just pawns used by colonialist empires to oppress conquered peoples. Furthermore, they
forced their religious beliefs on people who were given no choice but to submit. Missionaries! They
were so intolerant! They had no appreciation for diversity!
That is the stereotype that we are so often presented with today. But where is the evidence?
Fourteen years ago a graduate student in sociology named Robert Woodberry went to a required
lecture given by a professor who was an expert on the spread of democracy around the world. In
that lecture the professor said that according to his research there seemed to be a link between
democracy and the work of Protestant missionaries. He also said in that lecture that someone
needed to do more research on that subject. So Robert Woodberry decided that he would take that
subject on for his doctoral dissertation.
Why did some countries develop stable representative governments while neighboring
countries suffered under dictators? Why did some countries enjoy economic growth and good public
health while other countries with similar geography, cultural background, and natural resources didn’t?
For example, in both the French and Belgian Congo the colonial governments punished
people by burning down their villages and even cutting off their children’s arms. In the French
Congo those atrocities took place without creating any protest movement, but in the Belgian Congo
those abuses aroused a huge international protest movement. Why the difference? Robert
Woodberry discovered that Protestant missionaries were not allowed to work in the French Congo,
but they were permitted to work in the Belgian Congo. Two of those Protestant missionaries, John
and Alice Harris, took photographs of the atrocities and smuggled them out of the country. Then the
two of them traveled around the United States and Britain stirring up public disgust against those
terrible abuses.
Robert Woodberry did more than just collect case studies like that. Over the years he and
fifty research assistants collected a huge database measuring all kind of possible factors. He
wanted to be sure that he didn’t mistake correlation for causation. In other words, just because two
things are present at the same time—Protestant missionaries and democracy—it doesn’t mean one
caused the other. So Woodberry measured things including climate, health, location, accessibility,
natural resources, colonial power, and disease prevalence. He used a technique called “two-stage
least-squares instrumental variable analysis.” (I haven’t the slightest idea what that means so
please don’t ask me to explain it.) The point is that this sociologist really did his homework!
Here’s the conclusion that he came to: “Areas where Protestant missionaries had a
significant presence in the past are on average more economically developed today, with
comparatively better health, lower infant mortality, lower corruption, greater literacy, higher
educational attainment (especially for women), and more robust membership in nongovernmental
associations.” In other words, Protestant missionaries had a huge impact! Their work changed
nations for the better.
Woodberry published his research two years ago, and he has received four major awards for
his study. Over a dozen other studies have confirmed his conclusions. I found the observation of
one professor who reviewed his work to be particularly noteworthy. He said, “I’m not religious. I
never felt really comfortable with the idea of [mission work]; it seemed cringe-worthy. Then I read
[Woodberry’s] work. I thought, Wow, that’s amazing. They left a long legacy. It changed my views
and caused me to rethink.”
There are three reasons why I share all of that information with you. First, please don’t fall
for the negative portrayals of missionaries that are so prevalent in our culture today. Missionaries
did, of course, make mistakes. Let’s not pretend otherwise. But the overall impact of Protestant
missions around the world and throughout history has been extraordinarily good. Don’t be fooled
into thinking otherwise!
Second, bringing people to a living faith in Jesus Christ produces a ripple effect. The
missionaries did not set out to be political activists, but one thing led to another. Missionaries led
people to a living faith in Jesus Christ, and then they wanted those people to have Bibles so that
they could read God’s Word for themselves. That meant that the people needed to learn how to
read. When someone learns how to read, all kinds of opportunities open up for that person. That’s
why Christianity has had such a wonderful ripple effect and made the world a better place.
Here’s the third reason why I’ve gone on at such length about this article. This research
should make us ask a question of ourselves. What does the church today—and what do you and I
as individual believers today—need to do so that future generations will someday look back at us
and see that our love for Jesus Christ has also produced a ripple effect and has made this world a
better place? Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount that his disciples are the salt of the earth, but
he also said that we need to be on guard so that we don’t lose our saltiness (Matt. 5:13). How can
we stay salty?
That is an important issue for us to address. Sometimes the church here in America seems
to be nothing but a religious reflection of the world around us. We follow the latest fads in
entertainment and the latest trends in ethics. We allow the world to set the agenda and press us
into its mold. We justify that by saying that we want to be relevant to the needs of modern society.
But so often just the opposite takes place. The more we become like the world, the more irrelevant
we become because we don’t have anything distinctive to offer to people. As we think about the
future, what should we as Christians and as a church be emphasizing? We must not lock ourselves
into the past and never change. That doesn’t get you anyplace. But we must also be sure that we
are not allowing the world to conform us to its image.
Think about the apostle Paul. When Paul writes his second letter to the Corinthians, he is
being challenged. Some impressive new teachers have come to Corinth, and they have set
themselves up as superior to Paul. Paul refers to them as “super-apostles.” In comparison to them
Paul comes across as so ordinary and weak. Why should anybody pay any attention to him? So
what does Paul do in response? Does he say, “I better change and be like those ‘super-apostles’?
No. In effect, Paul says, “I know what I am doing and why I’m doing what I’m doing. And I am not
going to change the fundamental principles of my ministry. No matter how the ‘super-apostles’ put
me down, I am going to keep on doing what I know God wants me to do.”
Can we say the same thing? Do we know what we’re doing and why we’re doing it? Are we
prepared to continue along that path even if the world challenges us and accuses us of being
irrelevant? There is so much that could be said on this subject. This morning I would like us to look
at just two characteristics of Paul’s ministry and then think about how they apply to us.
Stay True to the Message
First, there is the message. Paul explains the message that he preaches in chapter 5 of his
letter, and it is worth remembering.
20 We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us.
We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.
21 God made him who had no sin to
be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. (2 Cor. 5:20-21)
Paul’s message in the first century and the message that we need to continue to announce today is
contained in those two verses. None of us live the way that God wants us to live. All of us are
sinners. And it is actually worse than that. We like to think of ourselves as the center of the
universe. We act as if we know better than God does how life should work. God should take a few
lessons from us! So we insist on doing things our way! Isn’t that the way we operate? We are not
just sinner; we are also rebels. We may know how to disguise our rebellion so that it is not obvious
to other humans, but God is not fooled. We are in rebellion against God. The message of the
Christian faith is that all of us need to be reconciled to God. That’s why Paul says, “We implore you
on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.”
How can peace with God be established? “God made [Jesus] him who had no sin to be sin
for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” Jesus took the full punishment
for our rebellion when he died on the cross. It’s only by deliberately and consciously placing our
faith in him that we can be forgiven for our sins and reconciled to God. That is the message of the
Christian faith.
In the article that I told you about earlier, it was interesting to read how Robert Woodberry
described the missionaries who made such a long-term impact on the countries where they served.
They were Protestant missionaries, not Roman Catholic. But, more than that, they were what he
called “conversionary Protestants.” That’s the term he uses. I take that to mean that they stressed
the need for personal conversion. Their message was the same as the apostle Paul’s. “We implore
you: Be reconciled to God.” That is the message that we need to preach too.
Yet that message is not popular today. You can almost hear the voices of our culture saying,
“You need to be more tolerant! What about the Hindus and the Buddhists and the Muslims? Are
you implying that they are not reconciled to God? You need to embrace all the diverse faith
traditions of the world. You need to be more inclusive!”
If we follow that approach, our contemporaries will like us more. That’s true. But toning
down our message will also lead the church to its death. Water down the message of Jesus Christ
and his reconciling death on the cross—stop calling for people to trust in Christ as their Lord, and
eventually there will be nothing left that makes the church of Jesus Christ distinctive from any run-ofthe-mill
humanitarian organization. We need to stay true to the message!
Stay Eager to Sacrifice
Let’s notice something else that Paul mentions as crucial to his ministry. In chapter 12:11-
21, he touches on a number of differing things. He talks about the importance of perseverance (2
Cor. 12:12) and unity (2 Cor. 12:20) and holiness (2 Cor. 12:21), but he emphasizes sacrifice.
According to the “super-apostles,” one of the problems with Paul is that he preaches for free!
He doesn’t charge the Corinthians anything for his ministry (2 Cor. 11:7-9, 20-21; 12:13). In our
minds that seems like a strange accusation because we like things that are free. But it’s not hard to
understand. Remember that old adage that “you get what you pay for.” The “super-apostles” turn
that around and say, “You pay for what you get.” If the Corinthians aren’t paying anything, then they
are probably not getting anything! So why should anybody waste their time by listening to Paul?
Now look at how Paul responds to that accusation. He doesn’t apologize for it or say that he
is going to change. Instead he stresses how he is going to stay eager to sacrifice.
13 How were you inferior to the other churches, except that I was never a burden to you? [In
other words, I didn’t charge you anything.] Forgive me this wrong! [Can you hear Paul’s
sarcasm when he writes that?]
14 Now I am ready to visit you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you,
because what I want is not your possessions but you. After all, children should not have to
save up for their parents, but parents for their children.
15 So I will very gladly spend for you
everything I have and expend myself as well. If I love you more, will you love me less?
16 Be
that as it may, I have not been a burden to you. Yet, crafty fellow that I am, I caught you by
trickery! [That’s what the ‘super-apostles’ were saying. ‘Oh, that Paul, he’s just trying to pull
a fast one on by not asking for money!]
17 Did I exploit you through any of the men I sent to
you?
18
I urged Titus to go to you and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not exploit you, did
he? Did we not walk in the same footsteps by the same Spirit? (2 Cor. 12:13-18)
Paul gladly made sacrifices for the sake of the Christians there in the city of Corinth. He could have
insisted that they pay him for his teaching. That’s one of the things that the “super-apostles” did.
But Paul refused to follow their example. Instead he would remain true to his principles. He was
going to stay eager to sacrifice.
There is a lesson in Paul’s example for each of us individually. Are we willing to sacrifice for
the spread of the gospel of Jesus Christ? I think that there is also a lesson for us as a church. Are
we willing to sacrifice as a church so that others can hear about Jesus?
For the last year I’ve been thinking a lot about our church’s ministry to children. I hope that
this will be part of our discussion next Sunday morning during the Sunday School hour. As a church
and particularly as parents we want to protect our children, and we want to raise them to be disciples
of Jesus Christ. That’s understandable and good! But I wonder. Can we become so focused on
our own children that we overlook the opportunities that we have to reach children who come from
non-Christian homes?
On Wednesday nights we have parents who drop their children off here at our church. A
generation or two ago parents did that on Sunday morning. But today weekends are so packed with
events that we don’t find parents doing that. But they will bring them here to church on Wednesday
evenings. So often those children don’t know the first thing about Jesus. That is becoming
increasingly common in our country. But those children come to our church on Wednesday
evenings. What an opportunity! How should we respond? I think that we should respond by
making those children the focus of our Wednesday night ministries.
In our homes and on Sunday mornings we can concentrate on our children and their spiritual
development. We have plenty of opportunities to do that. But I think our focus on Wednesday
nights needs to shift. What kind of curriculum should we use? How can we structure and plan our
Wednesday night ministries so that children who know nothing about Jesus can start to learn about
him and come to a point where they will trust in him as their Lord?
It is not that our children will receive no benefit from our Wednesday night activities. That’s
not true at all. They will still learn things from the lessons, and they will also learn a wonderful lesson
about how they can be involved in telling others about Jesus. They can invite their friends to come.
Maybe those friends have never been inside a church and don’t know anything about Jesus. “It’s
your job to welcome them and make them feel comfortable. Don’t be surprised if they don’t know
anything about Jesus. Instead tell them that you would like to help them learn more about Jesus.”
That approach will require a sacrifice. It means that not everything in our church will be
focused on our children and our families and our welfare. Instead we are going to sacrifice so that
others can learn about Jesus. As a church we send people to the other side of the world to tell
people the good news of Jesus Christ. That requires a lot of sacrifice. Are we willing to make a
similar sacrifice right here in Bemidji in our own church? I hope that you will think about that! We’ll
talk about it more next Sunday morning.
Conclusion
As Christians our goal is to change the world. How do we do that? It would be nice if we
could just press a button, and everything would instantly become what God wants it to be. But that
is not the way it works, is it? As the study that I told you about at the beginning of this sermon
demonstrates, it takes time. It often goes unnoticed. One thing slowly leads to another. Our job is
to be the salt of the earth and stay salty. Stay true to the message. Stay eager to sacrifice.",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",5/25/2014,
"A little over forty years ago a conversation that took place at my parent’s home, and I
remember it so well. A friend of mine was visiting, and he was telling my dad about the ministry
that he was involved in. My dad had grown up during the Great Depression, and as a result he
was always very concerned about having enough money to live on. So he asked my friend,
“How do make any money? How do you make enough to pay your bills?” My friend replied,
“We trust that God will provide for us. We just live by faith.”
I can still recall the look on my father’s face. There was something about that answer
that did not sit well with him. So as nicely as he could, he said, “What if everybody just ‘lived by
faith’? Doesn’t somebody have to go out and earn a living?”
What does it mean to “live by faith”? That is probably the major question that I wrestled
with for the first twenty-or-so years of my Christian life. I trusted in Jesus as my Lord when I
was sixteen years old. As I grew in my life with God, I so often heard Christians use that
phrase—“living by faith.” I wondered: What does “living by faith” actually look like?
If you get a regular paycheck every couple of weeks from your employer, does that mean
that you are not “living by faith”? What does a person who is “living by faith” do when he or she
gets sick? Do you go see a doctor, or do you just pray and trust God to provide the healing?
Or what if you find yourself facing some tragedy or crisis? Sometimes I’ve gotten the
impression that the person who is truly “living by faith” can see how God is working all things
together for good. That Christian can explain exactly what God is doing in the midst of that
hardship. But what if you can’t do that? If you find yourself getting discouraged or depressed
when confronted by some kind of problem, does that mean that you don’t have much faith?
What does it mean to “live by faith”? What does “living by faith” look like?
This morning we are returning to our study of 2 Corinthians, and we come to a passage
in chapter 12 of Paul’s letter in which he writes in very personal terms. In the first 6 verses Paul
describes an extraordinary experience that he once had. He was caught up to what he calls the
third heaven or paradise. What an incredible experience that must have been! But then he
describes what happened after that experience.
7b Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my
flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.
8 Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take
it away from me.
9 But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is
made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my
weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.
10 That is why, for Christ’s sake, I
delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I
am weak, then I am strong. (2 Cor. 12:7b-10)
What is Paul’s thorn in the flesh?
As we think about what Paul says in those verses, three questions emerge. We will start
with the easiest one: What is this curious “thorn in the flesh” that Paul talks about?
We can be sure that it was not something that he was born with because he says that he
started to experience it after he had that experience of being caught up to heaven fourteen
years earlier. We can also be sure that it is not a minor irritation because he pleads with God to
remove it. It is something serious but not so debilitating that it prevents him from traveling
around the Roman Empire preaching the gospel.
More than that we cannot say. Over the last two thousand years all kinds of answers
have been put forward. Some people have suggested that it was malaria or gall stones or some
kind of serious eye condition. Maybe so, but we can’t be sure. I’m looking forward to meeting
Paul in heaven and asking him about his “thorn in the flesh.” I imagine myself waiting in line
because so many other people are asking him the same question!
Why does God have a “messenger of Satan” torment a believer?
Let’s go on to the second question. Whatever Paul’s “thorn in the flesh” is, why does
God have “a messenger of Satan” torment a believer in Christ?
7b Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was given a thorn in my
flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me.
8 Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take
it away from me. (2 Cor. 12:7-8 emphasis added)
There are four things that we should notice about Paul’s experience of his “thorn in the
flesh.” First, he identifies it as evil. It is “a messenger of Satan.” Paul does not pretend that it is
good. It’s evil, and Paul makes that clear.
Second, Paul pleads with God to remove it. “Three times I pleaded with the Lord to take
it away from me.” Paul does not like what he is going through. He doesn’t like it one bit!
Suffering is suffering! We don’t need to pretend that it is anything other than that. There is
nothing wrong with asking God to rescue you from your hardships.
Third, Paul recognizes his “thorn in the flesh” as something that God is using in his life.
Paul writes that it was “in order to keep me from becoming conceited” that God gave him the
“thorn in the flesh.” There was a divine purpose for this “thorn.” Remember that Paul had been
caught up to heavenly paradise. That would be something to brag about, wouldn’t it? But God
will not allow that. God gives Paul that “thorn in the flesh” to keep him humble. God uses evil
for Paul’s good. It is still evil. Let’s not forget that. But God uses it.
We find God doing that all through the Bible, don’t we? Think of Jesus’ death on the
cross. That is the best example. Jesus’ crucifixion is evil. An innocent man is railroaded into
getting the death penalty. Yet God uses that terrible injustice to provide the world with his love
and forgiveness. God does use evil in our lives too in order to accomplish his purposes for us.
There is a fourth aspect to Paul’s experience, and this one is important. It takes time for
Paul to recognize that God has some purpose behind his “thorn in the flesh.” “Three times I
pleaded with the Lord”! Paul doesn’t just pray a quick prayer and then—presto!—he instantly
understands and accepts God’s purpose. God can use evil for good, but we need to be careful
that we don’t turn that truth into some kind of cheap platitude or trite cliché.
“Living by faith” does not mean that you can instantly accept your trials as something good
from God. It doesn’t mean that you never struggle. It does not mean that you can provide a
satisfying explanation of how God is going to take some tragedy and turn it into something good.
It doesn’t mean any of that! Please don’t fall for those ideas! Living by faith means that you are
willing to go through the process of suffering. You call evil by its name. You plead with God to
remove your trial. But you also allow God to work within you so that over time you learn to accept
your trial and so that over time you see that God is using it to accomplish his good purposes in
your life. “Living by faith” is not a magic wand that you wave over your problems so that they
disappear. Trusting God in the ups and downs of life is a process that takes time and effort.
How is God’s “power . . . made perfect in weakness”?
Let’s go on to the third and most pressing question that comes from this passage. This
question comes out of verses 9 and 10.
9 But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in
weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that
Christ’s power may rest on me.
10 That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses,
in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am
strong. (2 Cor. 12:9-10)
Those two verses contain some of the most encouraging statements in all of the Bible.
God says, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Paul says,
“When I am weak, then I am strong.” Those are wonderful promises! But let’s explore them a
little. How do we put them into practice? How is God’s “power . . . made perfect in weakness”?
Imagine yourself in a weak or vulnerable position. Suppose you are out of work, and
you need a job. If you are trying to trust God and “live by faith” in that situation, what do you
do? Do you just stay home and pray, or do you go out and fill out every job application that you
can? What if you are sick and that illness goes on for several days? What is the proper godly
response to that situation? Some Christians will tell you that you should stay home and pray.
God is the Great Physician. Just trust him. If you go to see a doctor, it just shows that you are
not really trusting God! After all, doesn’t God say, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power
is made perfect in weakness.”
It is important that we first understand what these statements are not teaching us. The idea
that God’s “power is made perfect in weakness” is not an excuse to be irresponsible. I am sorry to
say that sometimes Christians act as if it is. “I don’t need to go see a doctor because God will
provide!” “I don’t need to think through how I’m spending my money because God will provide!”
Is that the kind of thing that Paul is talking about when he says in verse 10, “When I am
weak, then I am strong”? No! That’s not what he is teaching at all! Trusting God and “living by
faith” is not an excuse to be irresponsible. We shouldn’t make ourselves weaker or more
vulnerable than we already are. God does not want us to be consumed with worry over our bills
or illnesses. That’s true! But he does expect us to do what we can do when it comes to dealing
with those kinds of trials!
“Living by faith” is not an excuse to be irresponsible, and it is also not an invitation to be
presumptuous. God does not want us to deliberately put ourselves in situations so that he has
to rescue us. Again I’m sorry to say that sometimes Christians do that very thing.
A few years ago I came across a book by Tim Stafford. He is one of the most discerning
and perceptive Christian authors that I know of. The book is titled Surprised by Jesus. Tim
Stafford says something in the book that I have often thought, but I have never had the nerve to
say. In fact, I can’t recall ever hearing anybody say what he says.
For some years I belonged to a Christian group that had a considerable history of
taking risks for God. . . . One man felt called to preach the gospel in China, but he had
no money to get there. What to do? He bought a one-way ticket to Hawaii, which was
all he could afford. When he reached Honolulu, he found a way to the Philippines. From
there, God provided a plane ride to China, where he had a wonderful time of ministry.
The group took that as its ideal. . . . You could hire staff, rent offices, plan
events, invite speakers and musicians, do almost anything bold and brash for the
gospel. God would provide.
In fact, God often did provide. The stories about miracle faith were intoxicating.
The group developed a habit of relying on last-minute miracles. . . . They were not so
quick to admit that they relied equally on kindly donors who wouldn’t let well-meaning,
enthusiastic young Christians founder.
Eventually those donors tired of bailing out rash plans. . . .
Maybe it was faith. To me it seems . . . like the faith that Satan urged on Jesus:
jump, and God will have to catch you.
“Do not put the Lord your God to the test.” Ultimatums, fleeces, time limits–they
may pose as earnest exercises in prayer, but they are often fueled by ego, not faith. . . .
We set the test and expect God to meet it. That puts us in control of God rather than the
other way around.
1
Even now those words almost take my breath away. I cannot recall any other Christian writing
on this subject with such frankness and honesty.
“Living by faith” does involve taking risks. All of life involves risk because none of us
knows the future. But “living by faith” doesn’t mean that we should be rash. Experiencing God’s
power in our weakness does not mean that we deliberately try to be weak. It doesn’t mean that
we put ourselves in situations where God has to rescue us. That’s not faith. That’s presumption.
That’s what Jesus calls putting “the Lord your God to the test,” and Jesus says that is wrong.
So what does it mean to “live by faith”? How is God’s power made perfect in our
weakness? Here’s how I would summarize it. “Living by faith” means that you do all you can do
trusting that God will do more.
One of my favorite Bible verses comes from the Old Testament book of Nehemiah. The
citizens of Jerusalem are rebuilding the walls of the city, but the people in the surrounding
territories are threatening to attack the city. Nehemiah 4:8 says, “We prayed to our God and
posted a guard day and night to meet this threat.” That puts it so simply and clearly. The
people prayed to God. They knew they needed his protection. But they also “posted a guard
day and night.” They did what they could do. “Living by faith” means that you do all you can do
trusting that God will do more.
Think of Paul when he writes this letter to the Corinthians. Paul is being challenged by
the so-called “super-apostles” who have to Corinth. They are more impressive than Paul. They
are better speakers, and they tell more thrilling stories about the visions and revelations that
God has given to them. So how does Paul respond? “When I am weak, then I am strong.” In
effect, he says, “I’m not going to compete with the ‘super-apostles.’ I may appear weak and
unimpressive to others. In fact, my abilities are limited. I cannot do everything that I’d like to do.
But I know what I am doing in my ministry, and I know why I am doing it. So I am going to keep
on doing what I can do trusting that God will do more.”
I think of a story about Hudson Taylor, the famous missionary to inland China. Hudson
Taylor was a man of great faith. He took risks for God. No question about that! But he could also
spot counterfeit faith when he saw it. Some new missionaries came to China to join Taylor in his
work there, and they started taking classes to learn the Chinese language. They soon discovered
that it was hard and tedious work to learn a foreign language. So they decided that they would
pray that God would give them the miraculous Pentecostal gift of speaking in tongues—
specifically the ability to speak in Chinese. Doesn’t that sound Christian? They were not going to
study. Any non-Christian could do that! They were going to pray for God’s provision!
Hudson Taylor learned about these new missionaries and their prayer, and he said to
them, “If I could put the Chinese language into your brains by one wave of the hand, I would not
do it.” Taylor understood the value of the slow process of learning Chinese.
2 And he
understood that trusting God is not a replacement for hard work. Living by faith means that do
all that you can do trusting that God will do more.
So you are looking for a job. You pray. You pray long and hard. And you also fill out a lot
of job applications. You are sick, and it is not getting any better. You pray. You ask others to pray.
You also go and sit in the clinic and wait your turn to see the doctor. That’s what faith looks like.
“Living by faith” means that you do what you can do in your situation and within your
limitations all the time praying and trusting that God will do more.",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",5/18/2014,
"Last week Berta and I were out in Oregon visiting our children and our grandchildren. Our three
year old grandson, Charlie, is really into Batman and Captain American and Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles. So Charlie and I spent a lot of time playing superheroes. One of the things that we discovered
was that The Bad Guys were living in his backyard. So several days in a row we had to go out there
and get them! I am happy to report that once again the citizens of Portland, Oregon, can go to bed at
night knowing that their city has been made safe. That’s just what we humble superheroes do! We get
rid of The Bad Guys!
Grandchildren! Children! Brothers and sisters! Cousins! Nieces and nephews. Moms and
Dads! They are all gifts from God, and we should thank God for them. There is no better time to do
that than on Mother’s Day. I say that knowing that some of us here today do not look back and
immediately think of good family experiences. And none of us now live in perfect families, do we? We
all have our share of disappointments. We all have plenty of room for improvement.
This morning I would like us to do a simple Bible study. In our responsive reading we recited
several passages from various places in the Old Testament and the New Testament. I would like us to
think about them particularly as they relate to family life. Here’s my recommendation: As we make our
way through the Bible verses in this responsive reading, put a check mark next to the ones that you
know you need to work on. Then throughout the week take this sheet of paper out and read it over
again. Ask God to help you put these instructions of his into practice.
God
We begin with a Bible verse that states the general theme of the Old Testament book of
Proverbs.
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding. (Prov. 9:10)
You might ask, “What does that have to do with family life?” As it turns out, it has a lot to do with family
life.
Several months ago a study came out that was titled, “Red States, Blue States, and Divorce.” It
was an article published in the American Journal of Sociology. One of the publicized findings of this
study was that regions of the country that have large populations of conservative Protestants have a
higher than average divorce rate. That’s a sad statistic, isn’t it? We Christians for all of our talk about
marriage actually do worse than non-Christians!
That makes for attention getting headlines, but it’s not the whole story. Statistics can be so
misleading. Don’t believe every statistic that you come across—even if it comes from a research
organization that claims to be Christian.
1
A closer analysis of the data reveals that there is a big difference between couples who attend
church two or more times a month and those who attend less than two times a month. In other words,
there is a difference between active Christians and those who are Christian in name only. To put it
bluntly, going to church and actively worshiping God on a regular basis will significantly reduce your
likelihood of divorce.
2 No, it is not a 100% money-back guarantee, but it does make a big difference.
Do you want to have a healthy marriage and family? Make it a habit of going to church every
Sunday! That does make a difference! “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and
knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.” Let’s think about the next several parts of our responsive reading. The first reading is a short
one, but it is so practical. Every phrase is packed with meaning.
My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to
speak and slow to become angry because human anger does not produce the righteousness
that God desires. (James 1:19-20).
We’re going to take some time to think about those words. Here are instructions dealing with that allimportant
subject of communication. How do we communicate with each other?
We need to “be quick to listen.” That doesn’t come naturally, does it? We are naturally quick to
talk and slow to listen! With God’s help we need to learn learn new habits.
The importance of listening is emphasized in the Old Testament book of Proverbs too. “To
answer before listening—that is folly and shame” (Prov. 18:13). Does that Bible verse strike pretty
close to home for you? When you are angry, you’re sure that you are right, aren’t you? I know I am. I
tell myself that I have the whole situation completely analyzed. There’s no need to listen to anybody
else. I know what’s right! I know what’s wrong!
“To answer before listening—that is folly and shame.”
None of us have every situation perfectly analyzed. That’s hard to admit when you’re “in the
thick of it.” It’s particularly hard in our families because we know each other so well. We have the
same basic conversations many times over. “I don’t need to listen. I already know what Mom is going
to say!”
I’d like to suggest something to you who are students. Do you want to give your mom a nice
Mother’s Day present? Later on today after your mother has expressed some kind of disapproval of
something that you are doing, turn to her and say, “Mom, I want to be sure that understand what you’re
saying. If I heard you correctly, you said that . . . [then you repeat what you heard her saying to you].”
Try that out on your mom this afternoon. Please be sure that your mom is sitting down before you say
that to her because she is likely to have a heart attack. But try it! It will make her day—if she lives
through it.
Listening is work. So let’s get to work and make the effort to listen to the others that we live
with. “Be quick to listen.”
“Be quick to listen [and] slow to speak.” A verse in Proverbs spells that out for us in more detail.
The heart of the righteous weighs its answers,
but the mouth of the wicked gushes evil. (Prov. 15:28)
Picture yourself taking some gold nuggets and carefully placing them on a scale. You want to see
exactly how much they weigh. Every ounce is valuable, so you want to weigh it very carefully. That’s
the idea behind this proverb. “The heart of the righteous weighs its answers.” Every word is valuable,
so be careful what you do with uour words.
Just this year I came across a little bit of advice that for some reason has stuck with me. I think
it came from the former Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates. He was apparently fond of saying, “I try
hard never to miss an opportunity to keep my mouth shut.” How many opportunities do we have to
keep our mouths shut? Don’t miss taking advantage of those opportunities! That’s good advice.
I recall a prayer that I came across back in college. That was a long time ago. I needed this
prayer then, and I’m sorry to say that I probably need it just as much now as then.
Lord, you know better than I know myself that I am growing older. Keep me from the
fatal habit of thinking that I must say something on every subject.
Release me from craving to try to straighten out everybody's affairs. Teach me the
glorious lesson that occasionally it is possible that even I may be mistaken. With my “vast store
of wisdom,” it seems a pity not to use all of it—but you know, Lord, that I do want a few friends
at the end.
“Be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry.” Once again we find a verse from
Proverbs bringing that teaching to life.
Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam;
so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out. (Prov. 17:14)
What a picture that verse paints for us. Imagine a large earthen dam holding back the
floodwaters. The pressure builds and builds. Then a trickle of water appears and grows. Then the
whole dam lets loose! You get washed away in the flood. Do you ever get into an argument like that?
Does that ever happen at your house? Before you know it, you are saying things that you don’t really
mean and that you know are exaggerated. But arguments can so quickly get out of control! “Starting a
quarrel is like breaching a dam; so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out.” Think twice—or
maybe three or four times—before you bring up a subject that you know is going to cause problems.
I think of a church that I visited once over in Scotland. I don’t think that I will ever forget it. It’s
called the Church of the Holy Rude, and it’s located in the city of Stirling. There was a preacher there
who had a hard time getting along with his associate pastor. Eventually the church split into two
separate congregations. The people built a wall right down the middle of the church. It divided the
building in half. One church used one side, and the other church used the other side. That wall was
built in 1656, and those two churches continued to worship separately until the wall was torn down in
1936.
3 That’s 280 years! “Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam [or building a wall down the center
of the church]; so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out.”
Of course, we cannot always drop things. In families there are things that have to be discussed
no matter how disagreeable they are. If we don’t discuss those issues, then we are falling into denial.
Denial can work for a short period of time, but it doesn’t work in the long run. Big problems have to be
brought out into the open and resolved. So when we do find ourselves in that situation, what should we
do?
A gentle answer turns away wrath,
but a harsh word stirs up anger. (Prov. 15:1)
That is another one of those instructions that is so immediately applicable. When somebody in your
family gets upset with you, you want to return the favor, don’t you? It’s so tempting to let them have it!
But that doesn’t solve the problem, does it? “A gentle answer turns away wrath . . .”
“. . . but a harsh word stirs up anger.” There is a reminder that if you are going to say something
critical of someone (and sometimes that is necessary), do your best not to add a lot of emotion to it.
The fact is that most of us are pretty sensitive—even if we carry ourselves with a lot of swagger and
look tough on the outside. Criticism—no matter how gently expressed—hits most of us pretty hard. So
we need to take time and let our emotions cool off for a while. It’s not just children. We adults need to
take “time outs” too. Then—after we’ve had some time to settle down—then we talk about the problem
at hand.
“My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to
speak and slow to become angry.” Why? “Because human anger does not produce the righteousness
that God desires.”
Our words have so much power. Sometimes a friend can say just the right thing and cheer you
up, but on other occasions that same friend may make some offhand and careless comment that ruins
your entire day. We need to beware of the power of our words.
Yesterday I was catching up on letters from our Global Partners, and I read one written by a
woman that our church supports. As she wrote about what God had been teaching her, she mentioned
a recent incident in her life. One morning she was putting on her make-up. As she stood in front of the
mirror, she recalled a conversation that had taken place twenty-five years earlier when she was in high
school. One of the boys that in her group of friends had said that he thought that girls should not hide
their natural, God-given beauty with make-up. As one of the girls who did wear make-up, she tried to
defend herself and the use of make-up. But the next day she decided that he had a point, so she didn’t
wear any make-up that day to school. When that boy saw her that day, he looked at her and said, “You
need to go and put some make-up on.”
That happened twenty-five years ago, but as she stood in front of the mirror that day—now a
mature adult woman—it all came back to her. She remembered it vividly, and once again she felt the
pain—just as fresh and strong as if it had happened that very day.
Communication is so important. Let’s beware of the power of our words! The final part of our responsive reading comes from the New Testament book of Colossians.
Once again they are so relevant to the way that we live.
Therefore, as God’s chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with
compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one
another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And
over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. (Col. 3:12-14)
I think that those instructions are so important that I try to include them in every wedding
ceremony that I conduct. Sometimes the couple picks them as their Scripture reading for the wedding.
If not, I’ll work them into my message or use them as a benediction. I am going to get them into that
wedding one way or another! I think that they are that important.
I realize that on their wedding day the couple is more than likely not listening to what I’m saying
to them. I know that. They are off in the clouds some place. If they are listening, they are not giving
my thoughts a whole lot of serious consideration. “’Bear with each other?’ Well, of course, we will!
‘Forgive one another.’ Don’t worry about that one, Pastor! No problem!” That’s fine. It is their wedding
day. It’s wonderful to live in the clouds for awhile.
I can’t tell you how many times after the wedding is over and I’m sitting at the reception that
some guest at the wedding has come up to me and mentioned how glad they were that I said
something about the importance of forgiveness. That has happened so many times. It’s not that I have
said anything terribly new and profound on the subject. All I’ve done is to take these verses and point
out that they do apply to family life.
We need this teaching. Anger and bitterness can so easily grab hold of us in our families, and it
can consume us. Don’t you know that to be true from your own experience? Some of you are thinking
right now of something that happened years ago that still hurts to think about. We need to forgive. And
with God’s help we can. Don’t hang on to the way that your family members have hurt you. Don’t
nurse those grudges. If you let them, they will eat you alive. They will poison your attitude toward life.
They will rob you of all your joy.
“Forgive as the Lord forgave you.” Are you glad that God sent his Son Jesus to die on the cross
for you? Have you experienced his forgiveness? Do you rejoice that God is not holding anything
against you because of Jesus?
Give that gift to the person who has hurt you. Forgiveness takes work. It’s not easy. But it is
what God wants you to do, and it is in your best interest too.
Conclusion
I asked you at the beginning of this sermon to check off any of Bible verses that apply to you.
Did you find any?
We need God’s Holy Spirit to work in our lives and in our homes, don’t we? If we are going to
live by these principles, God is going to have to help us. So let’s close with a prayer.
Lord, make us instruments of your peace.
Where there is hatred, let us sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is discord, union;
where there is sadness, joy.
Grant that we may not so much seek to be consoled as to console;
to be understood as to understand;
to be loved as to love. Amen.

",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",5/11/2014,
"I need to begin this sermon in an unusual way. There are two things that you should know
about this sermon right from the beginning.
First, the sermon that I am going to preach this morning is not the one that I originally intended
to preach. When I started to study 2 Corinthians 12:1-10, I thought that I was going to head in one
direction. But then in the course of my preparation I realized that I needed to go in a different direction.
This is not the sermon that I intended to preach.
The second thing that I want you to know is that this is not a sermon that I particularly want to
preach. I say that because I know that some of you will disagree with what I say, and some of you may
strongly dislike what I say. I base that on past experience when I have addressed the same subject
that we’re going to think about this morning.
I do want you to know that it’s OK if you disagree with me. That’s true this morning. In fact, that
is true every Sunday morning! I hope that you will listen to what I have to say and then ask whether it
accurately represents what God teaches us in his inspired Word. If I am not being true to what God
says in the Bible, then I hope that you will reject what I say. I mean that! But I also hope that you will
not jump to that conclusion. Please do listen to what I’ve learned and think about it—even if it does
ruffle your feathers at first.
This morning we continue our ongoing study in Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians, and we
come to a fascinating passage of Scripture. You read it, and you cannot help but wish that Paul would
tell us more. He writes about a man who is caught up to the third heaven or paradise. Don’t you wish
Paul would tell us more about what the third heaven and paradise are like? Then Paul mentions that
famous “thorn in the flesh” that God gave to him. What do you think that “thorn” is? Wouldn’t you like
to know that too?
This passage raises the issue of spiritual experience. What should be the nature of our
experience with God? What should we expect? What does God promise to all of us who have trusted
in Jesus Christ? And what do we make of other Christians’ spiritual experiences? Should each one of
us who believes in Jesus experience exactly the same thing?
This is an issue that I have wrestled with throughout my life as a believer in Jesus. I think back
to the 1970s when there was so much talk about the charismatic gifts of the Spirit. Does God want all
of his children to speak in tongues? How does a person get that gift? What happens if you don’t
receive that gift?
I also remember a funeral that I once led. A young woman was asked to sing a song at that
service, but before she started to sing she stood up and said that God had given her a vision that day.
In that vision she had seen the deceased person in heaven. Therefore, she declared that all of us
could be sure that he was without question with the Lord in heaven. As I listened to her, I wondered
why God hadn’t given me that vision. After all, I was the one leading the funeral. It would have been
nice if God had passed that information on to me!
Over the last fifteen years or so I have heard more and more about what is called “listening
prayer.” It’s the idea that prayer should be a two way conversation. We are fond of talking about how
we can have a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ, aren’t we? In what kind of
personal relationship does one person do all of the talking? When we talk to God in prayer, shouldn’t
we also expect to hear from God? So what we need to do is to learn how to listen to God so that we
can hear his voice.
Here’s one more example. Right now there is a movie out called Heaven Is for Real, based on
the book by the same title. I know that some of you have read the book or seen the movie. It’s the
story of how a little boy had a life-threatening medical emergency and went to heaven and then came
back to life here on earth. The book and the movie explain what that boy saw in heaven. What do you
make of that story? What should we make of that story?
Here is the issue: How should we understand our own spiritual experience and how should we
respond to others’ spiritual experiences?
Paul’s Experience
There is no better place to explore that question than in our passage this morning. We are
going to concentrate on the first six verses of 2 Corinthians 12 where Paul describes how he was
caught up to the third heaven or paradise.
When you first read those six verses, of course, you get the impression that Paul is not talking
about his own experience. He’s talking about someone else’s experience. “I know a man in Christ who
fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven” (2 Cor. 12:2). It certainly appears at first reading
that Paul is not describing his own experience. He is telling us about someone else’s experience.
Wait a minute! We need to remember that 2 Corinthians 12 does not stand alone. This chapter
is just one part of a long discussion that began in chapter 10. Paul is dealing with a serious problem.
Some new teachers have come to Corinth, and they have started to have a major impact on the
Christians living in that city. In the course of their teaching they have, in effect, said that Paul is not
worth listening to. He is not an impressive speaker, and he has not had the same kinds of visions and
revelations that they have received from God. Paul is so ordinary and unimpressive compared to these
teachers that Paul calls “super-apostles” (2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11).
In chapters 10 through 12 Paul responds to the accusations of the “super-apostles.” But he is
torn over how to do that. He doesn’t want to brag about himself, but he has to say something. So in 2
Corinthians 12:2 Paul talks about this man he knows who was caught up to the third heaven. Who is
that man? It has to be Paul himself. If it is someone other than Paul, how could that man’s experience
add anything to Paul’s defense of his ministry? Imagine Paul saying, “I know someone else who had
an extraordinary experience. Therefore, you should pay attention to me!” Who would fall for that line of
reasoning? Nobody would fall for that! So we find Paul defending himself but trying to do so in a way
that doesn’t call a lot of attention to himself.
Let’s look at what he has to say. There are four things that we need to observe about Paul’s
record of his spiritual experience. First, it is rare. “I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was
caught up to the third heaven” (emphasis added). Fourteen years ago! Paul has had visions and
revelations from God just like the “super-apostles” have had. They are not any better than he is. But
Paul does not indicate that he gets visions from God all the time. In other words, this kind of
experience is not the norm. It has not been his regular experience. It is rare.
Second, this experience was unexpected. Paul says that he was “caught up to the third
heaven” (emphasis added). He uses that expression in verse 2 and again in verse 4. This experience
was all God’s doing. It was not a result of some particular spiritual discipline that he practiced. He had
not learned some new and exciting spiritual technique that enabled him to have this kind of experience.
God had given him this experience. Paul had not expected it.
Third, this experience was personally meaningful. That shouldn’t come as any surprise to us.
How could you be “be caught up to paradise and [hear] inexpressible things” (verse 4) and not find that
to be an extraordinarily meaningful experience?
There is a fourth characteristic to this experience. Paul’s experience is rare, unexpected, and
personally meaningful. It is also publicly limited. It meant a great deal to Paul himself, but he realizes
that it cannot have the same impact on other people. “Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be
a fool, because I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than is
warranted by what I do or say, or because of these surpassingly great revelations” (2 Cor. 12:6-7a
emphasis added).
1 Paul understands that what is personally meaningful to him may be limited in the
effect that it has on others. He does not say, “I’ve had this extraordinary experience, and you can too!
I’ll tell you how you can get it!” No, Paul doesn’t say anything like that at all. Paul relates this
experience in order to demonstrate that the “super-apostles” are not superior to him, but as soon as he
makes that point he immediately plays down the public significance of what he has experienced.
Paul’s spiritual experience is rare, unexpected, personally meaningful, but publicly limited in
what it can accomplish. With Paul’s experience in mind, let’s consider some lessons that you and I might learn from
what he says. These are my conclusions. You don’t have to agree with them, but I do hope that you
will consider them.
Here is where I start: Thank God that he does work in the lives of his people! We do not
worship a God who is remote and uninvolved. If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, he is at work in you.
There will be times when you will feel close to him. Thank God for those times! The Christian life is not
a dry and dull routine. It is not inappropriate to say that through Christ we can have a personal
relationship with God.
Furthermore, let’s thank God that we can be encouraged from other Christians’ spiritual
experience. We do find in Paul’s writings examples of him citing his own experience as a model for
others. In 1 Timothy 1:15b-16, Paul writes:
15
. . . Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst.
16 But
for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might
display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive
eternal life. (1 Tim. 1:15b-16)
Paul is saying that God forgave him, and he can forgive all of us in the same way. There is a place for
what we call “personal testimonies.” We can learn from one another and by encouraged by others’
spiritual experiences. Thank God that he does work in the lives of his people!
Having said that, we must also be on guard when it comes to interpreting spiritual experience.
Here are four things that I have learned to be on guard against.
First, be on guard against expecting God to act exactly the same way with each of his children.
This is one of the problems that comes with giving personal testimonies. We compare ourselves to
other people. “Oh, that person has a more exciting story to tell about God than I have! My faith in
Jesus is so unimpressive. I must not be very important to God.” Have you ever had that thought go
through your mind after you have heard someone else tell about their coming to faith in Christ?
Please put those thoughts out of your mind! God works with us personally as distinct
individuals. Thank God that he does! If you came to faith in Jesus Christ in some dramatic way, thank
God for that. But if you cannot give the exact date and time when you trusted in Jesus because you
were brought up in a Christian home, thank God for that! God does not run us through a spiritual
assembly line so that we all come out looking exactly the same! He deals with us personally and
individually.
Second, be on guard against expecting God to do more than he has promised. I think of that
expression that we use so often—“personal relationship with God.” I’m not against that expression. I
often use it myself. But I wonder if it has been overused. Sometimes people draw conclusions about
what our experience with God should be like more from that phrase than from the Bible. The current
interest in “listening prayer” is a good example. In personal relationships between human beings one
person does not do all the talking. Therefore, some people might conclude that’s the way that it should
be in our relationship with God too. So Christians start to expect God to talk to them. And that leads to
them thinking that God has been and is saying things to them when he really hasn’t been. So then they
mistake their thoughts and desires and hopes for what they interpret to be the voice of God.
Several years ago I read about the experience of Rachel Saint. Some of you will remember her
as one of the missionaries who did pioneer missionary work among the Auca Indians in Ecuador.
Rachel Saint once told her son that years earlier she had been given a vision of a tribe of people who
had never heard that the Lord Jesus loved them. In that vision God promised her that if she continued
to be faithful to him, then he would allow her the privilege of taking the gospel to those people. That’s
pretty impressive, isn’t it? But Rachel Saint also told her son that she only such a vision once in her
entire Christian life. That has the “ring of truth” to me. I do believe that God can and does sometimes grant people
visions or even speak to them audibly. But those are the exceptions and not the rule. The Bible does not teach us that such experiences will be the norm. We should not expect them or somehow demand
them from God.
3
Here’s a third warning: Be on guard against super-spirituality or spiritual elitism. So often I
have observed people telling about their spiritual experiences thinking that they will encourage other
Christians when the reality is that they discourage other Christians and make them doubt the reality of
their faith. The people who are listening come away wondering why God hasn’t granted them the same
experience. Why has God appointed them to be just second-class citizens in the kingdom of God?
4
I’m sorry to say that I learned this lesson shortly after I trusted in Christ. In the summer of 1969
I was so excited about my newfound faith in Jesus. I knew that God had changed my life, and I wanted
to pass the good news of Jesus along to others. At that time I was part of a group that thought that
they had a monopoly on God’s truth, and I absorbed that same attitude. I had been a Christian for all of
three months, and I was more than ready to teach others all about God. So I tried to pass along some
of my spiritual experience to others, but for some reason those other people didn’t have the same
experience. I remember one young man in particular who ended up questioning his faith as a result of
what I had told him. Here it is almost forty-five years later, and it still hurts me to think about that.
Some older Christian should have taken me aside and said, “Young man, you know just enough to be
dangerous. Give yourself some time before you start to think that you are ready to teach others.”
Please watch out for anything that smacks of super-spirituality or spiritual elitism.
There is one more thing that I want to ask you to beware of. Be on guard against making
experience more important that God’s revealed truth. That can happen in ways that appear at first to
be so innocent. Take the movie that is out right now—Heaven is for Real. A four year old boy tells
about his experience of going to heaven and seeing Jesus. It’s a thrilling story, and in some ways it
doesn’t cause any harm.
But I do wonder. In the book the little boy talks about how everybody in heaven has wings and
flies around.
5 Where in the Bible do we ever find any hint that people in heaven are going to have
wings? That is not just a small detail because it misrepresents what the Bible does teach about our
resurrection bodies.
And there is a more serious problem. Jesus told the man who was crucified next to him, “Today
you will be with me in paradise” (Luke 23:43). Do we really need a four year old boy to confirm Jesus’
teaching that heaven is for real?
Conclusion
Like I said at the beginning of this sermon, you don’t have to agree with everything that I have
said this morning. But I do hope that you will think about it. Most of all, I hope that you will pick up your
Bibles and read them. What does God promise us in terms of spiritual experience?
Closing Prayer
“God, thank you that you are real. Thank you that you do work in our lives through your Son
Jesus Christ. Lord, we want to experience everything that you have for us. We don’t want to miss out
on a thing! But please guard us from being misled and from misleading others. God, please keep us
humble. Amen.
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",4/27/2014,
"I love Easter. I like Christmas, but I love Easter.
If you read the historical records that we find in the New Testament, you do learn about
the miracle of Jesus’ conception by the Holy Spirit. The account of his birth in Bethlehem and
the visit by the shepherds and wise men is certainly worth noting. God did not have to send his
Son to this earth, but he did! God sent Jesus here in order to bring his love to an undeserving
world. Christmas is good.
But Easter is even better. It is at Easter when we see that Jesus completed the task that
his Father had sent him to accomplish. Jesus’ birth was just the start of the mission; his death
and resurrection mark the fulfillment of God’s purpose and plan. That’s why the New Testament
writers spend so much time describing the events leading up to Jesus’ death on the cross and
then describing what happened after his resurrection from the dead. All four of the Gospel
records—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John—emphasize Jesus’ death and resurrection far more
than they do his birth.
Christmas is good, but Easter is better!
Every year at this time I find it necessary to remind myself of two things. I think of both
the past and the present aspects of Easter. Jesus’ resurrection is something that happened in
the past that can change our lives in the present.
Easter Past
When I think about Easter past, I remind myself that Jesus really did rise from the dead.
The tomb was empty! As the angels said, “He is not here! He has risen!”
Some of us have heard the account of Jesus’ resurrection so many times that it no
longer startles us or makes a decisive impact on our minds. We need to be reminded that
Jesus’ resurrection is not just a traditional story that is nice to remember once a year. If we had
been in Jerusalem centuries ago and had gone to the tomb with the women early on that
Sunday morning, we too would have seen the stone rolled away and heard the message of the
angels. “He is not here! He has risen!” All of us need to be reminded of that.
There are probably some of us here today who approach Easter a little differently. We
come to church on Easter Sunday out of tradition, and we come with a sense of skepticism.
Going to church on Easter is a nice culturally-acceptable activity. But come on! Dead people
don’t come back to life! So we wonder if the story of Jesus coming out of the grave three days
after he had been crucified might be better understood as a wonderful literary metaphor meant
to convey that we humans can still have hope even in the face of tragedy. That is perhaps a
healthy and encouraging message. But let’s not get carried away and think that Jesus’ physical
resurrection really happened!
I understand why people might think of Easter that way. After all, the idea that someone
could be nailed to a cross and die in such a gruesome manner and then come back to life three
days later does stretch the imagination. But the idea that the New Testament writers tell that
story just to convey a vague message of hope doesn’t do justice to what we read in their books.
Read Matthew and Mark and Luke and John for yourself. You’ll see that they are not providing
us with a comforting literary metaphor. They are writing about something that they believe
actually happened.
1
Furthermore, they write about it in a way that communicates credibility. I’ll mention just
one sign of their trustworthiness. In all four of the Gospels we read that women were the first
ones to learn that Jesus had risen from the dead. That’s remarkable because in first century
Palestine and in most of the ancient world women were not accepted as legal witnesses. If you
were going to make up a story about a dead man coming back to life and hoped that people
would believe your story, you certainly wouldn’t have created a story in which the first witnesses
to the resurrection were questionable in the eyes of your contemporaries. But that is what we
find in the New Testament. That simple observation tells us something about how God values
women, and it also provides us with a small but powerful piece of evidence for the credibility of
the resurrection accounts.
2
As astounding as the New Testament accounts of Jesus’ resurrection are, we have good
reason to believe that Jesus did physically rise from the dead!
Easter Present
That is Easter past, and we must not forget it. But neither should we stop there. What
about Easter present? I’d put it this way: What is Jesus up to now? If he rose from the dead
two thousand ago, what’s he been doing since then?
The New Testament book that seems to address that subject the most is the book of
Hebrews. Think about what the writer says in chapter 10 of that book.
11 Day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties; again and
again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
12 But when this
priest [Jesus] had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand
of God. (Heb. 10:11-12 emphasis added)
What has Jesus been doing for the last two thousand years? He’s been sitting. After his
resurrection from the dead and his ascension into heaven, he sat down. And he’s been sitting
ever since.
That sounds strange, doesn’t it? For twenty centuries years Jesus has been doing
nothing but sitting around. Jesus is an eternal “coach potato”!
Hold on! That may be the idea that first comes to our minds, but let’s not jump to
conclusions. What does the letter to the Hebrews mean when it says that Jesus “sat down”? It
means two things.
First, it symbolizes completion. Jesus completed the ministry that God the Father
assigned to him. Hebrews 10:12 says “when this priest [Jesus] had offered for all time one
sacrifice for sins, [then] he sat down.” In the Old Testament priests didn’t have the opportunity
to sit down. They always had to stand and make more sacrifices for the sins of the Israelites.
But Jesus’ sacrifice of himself differs entirely from those earlier sacrifices. His is unique! Jesus
paid the price for the way that you and I have sinned. Think about the way that we naturally
prefer to do things our own way instead of doing things God’s way. Don’t we often act as if we know better than God? When Jesus died on the cross, he paid the full price for our rebellion
against God. The job had been completed. There was nothing left to do. So Jesus sat down!
Let’s think about what that can mean to us personally. Suppose that someone were to
stand up right now and announce to all the rest of us every wrong thing that you have ever
done. That person would then go on and list all the embarrassing thoughts that you have ever
entertained in your mind. How would you respond if that were to take place? If that were to
happen to any of us, we would be so ashamed and humiliated that we would immediately get up
and rush out of this room! Isn’t that true?
God knows all those things. God knows them all down to the very last detail. And
here’s the good news: Jesus died on the cross so that you and I can be forgiven of all those
things. All of them! Jesus offered himself as the one perfect sacrifice that provides complete
forgiveness. He paid the price for all the wrongs that we are guilty of. And then he sat down!
The job was done! His mission had been completed!
Thank God that you and I can experience that complete forgiveness that God offers to
us through his Son. All we need to do is to admit that we have lived self-centered lives. And
isn’t that true for all of us? Admit that to God, and then turn to Jesus Christ. Tell Jesus that you
are counting on him to make you acceptable to God. You are giving up on your own efforts to
impress God. Instead you are counting on Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross to do for you what you
cannot do for yourself. God promises that if you and I will humble ourselves in that way, then
we will be forgiven. We will be forgiven for the big things that we’ve done wrong and for the
small things that no one knows about but ourselves. All of our sins can be forgiven! Why?
Because Jesus sat down, and he has never needed to get up again!
Sitting down represents completion. It also conveys a message about authority or
power. Hebrews 10:12 says that Jesus “sat down at the right hand of God” (emphasis added).
Whenever I think about Jesus sitting at the right hand of God, I think of a story that
comes out of the Middle East. It comes from Saudi Arabia. After World War II the British were
trying to win the favor of King Saud so that they could have access to the oil in the Arabian
Peninsula. Winston Churchill decided to give King Saud a very special gift; he gave him a Rolls
Royce! The British government had a special Rolls Royce made for him. The back seat was
decorated luxuriously so that it would impress the king and make him comfortable when he sat
back there. The British held nothing back in order to win King Saud’s favor.
When the Rolls Royce arrived in Saudi Arabia, the king glanced at the back seat, but he
was not really interested in what he saw there. After all, men didn’t sit in the back seat. That’s
where the women sat. Men sat in the front seat! But King Saud was horrified when he looked at
the front seat. The steering wheel was on the right side of the car. That’s where his chauffeur
would sit, of course. That meant that he, the king, would have to sit on the left side of his
chauffeur. The right side was the seat of honor. The left side was the seat of dishonor! There
was no way that King Saud was going to sit on the left side of his servant! How humiliating
would that be! So King Saud immediately gave the Rolls Royce away to his younger brother.
Jesus sat down at the right hand of God. That is the place of honor. Think about what
that means. Jesus sat down at the right hand of God. He is in a position of authority and
power. So how is Jesus exerting that authority that is his? Let’s look at what the book of
Hebrews tells us about how Jesus uses his power.
18 Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are
being tempted. (Heb. 2:18) Please notice that the verse is present tense. Jesus “is able to help those who are being
tempted” (emphasis added). That verse is describing something that Jesus is doing now.
Jesus stands ready to use his power to help his followers resist the temptations that constantly
come at us in this life and to help us to live the way that God wants us to.
There is another part of the book of Hebrews that makes that same point, but puts it
even more forcefully.
14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has ascended into heaven,
Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.
15 For we do not have a
high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has
been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin.
16
Let us then approach
God’s throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to
help us in our time of need. (Heb. 4:14-16)
That is a remarkable passage. Jesus “has been tempted in every way, just as we are.”
Through his own experience here on this earth he understands just how difficult life can be.
Jesus is not way up in heaven lounging in divine luxury far away from the daily realities of our
lives. Just the opposite is true! One person put it this way: “The dust of the earth is on the
throne of the majesty on high.”
4 That captures the idea so well. The resurrected and living
Jesus understands all that you and I go through in this life because he has gone through the
same things that we experience.
If you have entrusted your life to Jesus Christ, then you are not alone in your
temptations. Jesus understands everything that you and I think and feel when we go through
trials. In fact, he understands our temptations and trials better than we do. Why do I say that?
Stop and think about it. Who feels the full force of a temptation? Is it the person who gives in
when the temptation first presents itself? Or is it the person who resists that initial temptation
and then continues to fight against that ongoing temptation? Who feels the full power of that
temptation? It’s not the person who gives in right away. It’s the person who continues in the
fight. Hebrews 4:15 says that Jesus was “tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not
sin” (emphasis added). In other words, Jesus was tempted but never gave in!
That insight into Jesus and his experience leads the writer to the Hebrews to an
important conclusion and application in verse 16. “Let us then approach God’s throne of grace
with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.”
No one is better equipped to help you and me with our daily struggles than Jesus himself. He is
capable of understanding us and he is willing and longing to use his power to help us.
Jesus stands ready and able to help you in the trials that you go through. Do you ever
feel lonely and worthless? Do you ever get so discouraged that you just want to shrivel up and
die? Do you ever feel attacked by jealousy or greed? You see what other people have, and it
consumes you. Does sexual temptation seem overpowering to you? Does frustration or anger
ever exert such a pull on you that you feel like you are going to blow up?
If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, know that your Lord is more than ready to help you
no matter what it is that you are facing. You can approach him confidently knowing that he is
capable and willing to help you in your time of need.
That is the message of Easter. That is what Jesus is doing now. Thank God for the
resurrection of his Son and our living Lord, Jesus Christ!

",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",4/20/2014,
"The more I learn about Jesus, the more I am drawn to him. The more I learn about
Jesus and the more that I am drawn to him, the more puzzled I am by him.
In one sense Jesus is easy to understand. You and I can read the four Gospels—
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and we can grasp fairly easily the outline of his life. He was
born in Bethlehem and brought up in Nazareth. When he was somewhere around thirty years of
age, he started his public ministry. For approximately three years he traveled throughout
Galilee and Judea urging his disciples to live the way that God wanted them to live. And he
performed some amazing miracles demonstrating that he was truly sent by God. Then he went
to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover. There the religious leaders of the Jewish
establishment conspired against him, and the Roman governor sentenced him to be executed
by crucifixion. But three days after his death he miraculously rose from the dead. That is the
story of Jesus, and I daresay that almost all of us here today have heard that story before. And
that is good!
But what about Jesus himself? Sometimes I think that our familiarity with the major
events of his life makes us assume that we understand him better than we really do. He almost
comes across as a one-dimensional figure who is always easy to understand. His motives are
pure. His goals are simple. To put it in modern terms, his psychological make-up is
straightforward. Nothing puzzling about Jesus! But I wonder: Is that true?
What would have been like to have been one of his disciples and to have had him look
you in the face and say, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to God except
through me”? Try to imagine the inflection of his voice or the expression on his face when he
tells his disciples that he is going to Jerusalem where he is going to be handed over to the
Roman rulers and be crucified. Can you imagine how the disciples respond to that startling
news?
The more I read the four Gospels and the more I spend time thinking about Jesus, the
more I realize how puzzling Jesus is. He doesn’t fit into anybody’s preconceived patterns. He
doesn’t live up to anybody’s expectations. The more I reflect on the historical records of Jesus’
life, the more—I don’t know exactly what word to use—the more sympathy I have for the
disciples. Is that putting it too strongly? I can’t help but think that there must have been times
when the disciples fell asleep at night scratching their heads trying to figure him out. I can
imagine Peter saying to himself, “I can’t get Jesus out of my mind, but sometimes I wonder if he
is out of his mind!”
Why does Jesus not respond to the request of the Greeks?
Take the words that we just read in John 12 as an example.
20 Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the
festival.
21 They came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, with a request. “Sir,”
they said, “we would like to see Jesus.”
22 Philip went to tell Andrew; Andrew and Philip
in turn told Jesus. (John 12:20-22)
Then we are told in verse 23 that Jesus replies. “Of course, I’d love to speak to those Greek
people. Andrew, you surely remember how I let the little children come to me and spend time
with me. And, Philip, don’t you remember how I was willing to spend time talking even with
prostitutes and tax collectors? So why do you even have to ask whether I’d be willing to spend
time with some Greeks? Go get them. I’d love to talk to them!”
But that’s not what Jesus says, is it? That’s not even close to what Jesus says to Philip
and Andrew!
23
Jesus replied, “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
24 Very
truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a
single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds. (John 12:23-24)
Jesus doesn’t say one single thing about the Greeks who want to meet him, does he? Doesn’t
he hear what Philip and Andrew are talking to him about? And why does he start all of a
sudden to give a lesson in agriculture to the two of them? “Unless a kernel of wheat falls to the
ground . . .” Does this conversation make sense to you?
Why does Philip go first to Andrew and not straight to Jesus?
And here’s another puzzling thing. It is a small point, but I can’t help but wonder about it.
Why does Philip go and tell Andrew about the Greeks and their request? Philip is one of the
twelve disciples. He knows Jesus well. So why doesn’t he just go by himself to tell Jesus about
these Greek people? Why does he have to check with Andrew and go with him to tell Jesus
about the Greeks? Don’t you find that to be a little puzzling?
Why does Jesus deliberately present himself as the fulfillment
of the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah?
This exchange between Jesus and his disciples is curious, but it’s nothing compared to
what Jesus had done earlier that day. Do you want a real puzzle? Think about Jesus’ triumphal
entry into Jerusalem on that Sunday morning!
Matthew and Mark and Luke tell us that Jesus had made some prior arrangements so
that he could ride into Jerusalem on a donkey (Matt. 21:1-9; Mark 11:1-10; Luke 19:28-38).
That was a deliberate act. When Jesus mounts that donkey, he knows that he is fulfilling a
prophecy of the Old Testament about the coming of the Messiah who will rescue God’s people
from their enemies. John quotes the prophecy for us in verses 14 and 15 of chapter 12.
14
Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, as it is written:
15
“Do not be afraid, Daughter Zion;
see, your king is coming,
seated on a donkey’s colt.”
That is a prophecy from the Old Testament book of Zechariah. It’s Zechariah 9:9. Jesus, in
effect, deliberately announces to the crowd that he is God’s Messiah! He is the one that has
been chosen by God to fulfill his divine purposes for his people. He will rescue them from their
enemies! No wonder the crowds of people are cheering him. The Jewish people have been
waiting for centuries for their Messiah to come, and now he has arrived! “Look at him! There he
is on the donkey!”
But wait a minute. Hadn’t Jesus earlier in his ministry discouraged the crowds from
thinking of him as the Messiah who would overthrow the Romans? Every time that suggestion
had been put forward in any way at all, Jesus had squashed it. He did not want his disciples to
be thinking in those terms about him. But now at the most important Jewish feast of the year
when the Roman governor himself is in the city, Jesus deliberately and publicly announces that
he is fulfilling the Old Testament promises about the Messiah!
What in the world is Jesus doing? What is he thinking? This puzzle keeps getting more
complicated, doesn’t it?
After proclaiming himself to be the coming King, why does Jesus talk about his death?
Here’s another piece of the puzzle. Jesus publicly proclaims himself to be long awaited
Messiah of God. He is the King that the Jewish people have been waiting for. Yet just as soon
as he makes that announcement, he starts to talk about how he’s going to die. Look again at
Jesus’ agricultural reference in verse 24. “Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to
the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds”
(emphasis added). Even that statement could be understood in various ways by his disciples.
But as John goes on in his record of this conversation, he makes it clear that Jesus is talking
from verse 24 on about his death. Verse 33 states I unmistakably, “He said this to show the
kind of death he was going to die.”
You and I are probably not the least bit puzzled by Jesus introducing the subject of his
death into the conversation. But that’s because we know the story of the cross! We are familiar
with it—too familiar with it. It doesn’t shock us at all. Of course, Jesus dies! But Jesus’ first
disciples don’t know what we know. The idea that God’s Messiah will die before conquering the
enemies of God’s people is ludicrous. The idea that the Chosen One of God is going to be
killed by God’s enemies is not even in the realm of possibility. It is totally unimaginable!
Of all the puzzles of Palm Sunday, this is the one that must have bewildered Jesus’
disciples the most. Jesus is not making any sense at all! I wonder if Philip and Andrew
glanced at each other and then whispered their fears to each other. “Now Jesus really has
gone too far!”
Why does Jesus say that dying is his reason for living?
Jesus has one more startling thing to say. This short series of words may not puzzle us
because we live on the after-side of the crucifixion, but it should astonish us.
27
“Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this
hour’? No, it was for this very reason I came to this hour.
28 Father, glorify your name!”
(John 12:27-28a)
We need to consider those words carefully. “Now my soul is troubled.” Jesus knows
that he is going to be crucified, and he dreads the thought of what he is going to experience.
“Now my soul is troubled.” Do you feel the impact of that statement?
He follows it with a question: “. . . and what shall I say? ‘Father, save me from this
hour?’” Our response would be “Of course, that’s what you should pray for, Jesus! You don’t
want to be nailed to a cross!” But instead Jesus says, “No, it was for this very reason I came to
this hour.”
We need to let that statement sink in. “It was for this very reason I came.” There is the
ultimate answer to all the puzzles of Palm Sunday. Why doesn’t Jesus welcome the Greeks
who want to see him? It isn’t because he doesn’t care about them. He would gladly have
talked to them at an earlier stage in his ministry. But not now! Jesus knows that he has come
to the turning point of his entire ministry. Now he has to concentrate all of his thoughts so that
he is prepared for the cross. Everything else is secondary.
Why does Philip go first to Andrew and not straight to Jesus? We’re not told explicitly
what the answer to that question is. But it doesn’t take a lot of imagination to guess that Philip
senses that there is something different about Jesus on this particular day. He seems to be
preoccupied in a way that Philip has never seen him before. So Philip is hesitant and talks to
Andrew first.
Why does Jesus deliberately present himself as the promised Messiah? He had never
done that before, so why now? Because now is the time to throw off all restraint. Now is the
time for Jesus to reveal himself fully to the people. In the next few days they may again
entertain the idea that he is a military Messiah who will overthrow the Romans, but they will
soon learn the truth. The next few days will teach them in an unmistakable way that God has a
way of dealing with evil that is far beyond anything they have ever imagined.
After proclaiming himself to be the coming King, why does he talk about his death?
Because it is through his death and only through his death upon the cross that his kingdom will
be established.
“It was for this very reason I came.” There is the ultimate answer to the puzzles of Palm
Sunday. Jesus’ dying is his reason for living.
Did you catch the words of verse 28? As if he has not already said enough in verse 27,
he gives a short prayer in verse 28. “Father, glorify your name.” “Glorify”! That's the word
Jesus uses to describe his death. That’s puzzling, isn’t it? Here the answer: The glory of the
Father and the glory of the Son are found where we would least expect them—in the crucifixion.
God's mission for his Son was to die for you and me. God’s purpose throughout history has
been to provide a way that we his creatures could be forgiven of our rebellion against him and
be restored to a living relationship with him. God wants us to be forgiven, to experience his
love, and to enjoy him forever. God accomplished that through his Son. Jesus embraced that
mission as his own. Even though Jesus fully understood what it would cost him to provide for
our forgiveness, he wanted to die on the cross for you and me. It is at the cross where we see
God’s glorious purposes fulfilled. So Jesus says, “Father, glorify your name”
Conclusion
It's been said that you cannot understand Jesus until you understand his cross. That's
right. Jesus came to die for your sins and for my sins. He took the penalty for our disobedience
upon himself. Until you and I grasp that, we have not understood Jesus at all. We may honor
him as a martyr or respect him as a teacher or admire him as an example, but we are not his
disciples—we are not Christians—until we trust in him as our Savior and believe that he died for
us on the cross.
So I urge you. If you have never told Jesus that you believe that he died on that cross
for you, please do so today. That’s where life with God starts. And if you have told Jesus that
sometime in the past, will you bow your head again today and thank him for dying on the cross
for you?
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",4/13/2014,
"Let’s begin this morning with a Bible puzzler. Are you up for that? I want us to think about
two Bible verses that cannot help but puzzle you when you first read them. The first one is Proverbs
26:4.
Do not answer a fool according to his folly,
or you yourself will be just like him.
When someone says outrageous things or makes reckless accusations, this verse tells us that the
best thing to do is to simply ignore the person. Don’t say anything because if you do respond, you
will just get dragged into a messy and fruitless debate. That’s Proverbs 26:4. Now consider what
the next verse says. Proverbs 26:5 says:
Answer a fool according to his folly,
or he will be wise in his own eyes.
This verse is saying the exact opposite of what the previous verse says! Strictly speaking Proverbs
26:4 and 5 do contradict each other. What do you make of that?
We need to remember that these two Bible verses are proverbs, not commands. What is a
proverb? A proverb is a general truth. It is an observation that describes the way that life usually
works. Think about a proverb that is not in the Bible but one that we are familiar with: “Haste makes
waste.” When you hurry, you are liable to make a mistake. So don’t make rash decisions. Take
your time and think things through. “Haste makes waste.” That’s good advice, isn’t it? But is it
always true? If someone you love has a heart attack, you’d better get that person to the hospital as
fast as you can! So does “haste always make waste”?” Not always. Usually that is true, but it’s not
always true. That’s an example of how proverbs function. A proverb is an observation about the
way that life usually works.
Proverbs 26:4-5 are proverbs! They contain general truths that need to be carefully applied
in differing situations. It is often true that the best way to respond to a groundless accusation or
insult is to ignore it. “Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be just like him.”
That’s true. But sometimes people can accuse you or insult you for so long and do so much
damage. Then you need to “answer a fool according to his folly, or he will be wise in his own eyes.”
The accusation and insult cannot be allowed to continue. The record has to be set straight.
If you were to look for an example of how to apply Proverbs 26:4 and 5, you could hardly find
a better one than what Paul talks about in 2 Corinthians 10 through 12. As we have seen in our
previous studies, Paul is struggling with a difficult situation in the church in the city of Corinth. Some
new teachers have come on the scene. Paul refers to them as “super-apostles” (2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11)
because they have promoted themselves as being far superior to Paul.
Why do they think they are superior to Paul? It comes down to two things. They are
eloquent speakers. They know how to keep the attention of the Corinthians when they preach.
Paul, by comparison, is boring. Furthermore, these new teachers have captivated the Corinthians
with their stories about supernatural visions and revelations that they have received from God. Paul
doesn’t do that. In comparison to these new teachers, Paul is so ordinary and run-of-the-mill. Why
should the Corinthians waste their time on Paul when they can listen to the new and exciting “superapostles”?
So Paul responds. He has to. It’s not that he wants to protect himself so much. He has to
respond because he knows that the “super-apostles” are twisting the truth about Jesus and deceiving
the Corinthians about what it really means to live as a disciple of Jesus Christ (2Cor. 11:4).
Reflections on Conflict
Let’s think about and reflect for a moment on Paul’s emotions as he responds to this conflict.
Dealing with conflict is agonizing. Don’t you know that from your own experience? Paul feels that
same agony back in the first century. He’s not sure how to respond to the “super-apostles.” On the
one hand, he wants to ignore them. On the other hand, he can’t do that because they are deceiving
the people. He has to respond in some way.
I want to read part of 2 Corinthians 11 to you so that you can feel Paul’s agony. I am going
to read it to you from the Bible paraphrase called The Message. This is not a precise translation of
what Paul writes. Bible paraphrases take some liberties with the text, but I find them to be so helpful
in capturing the feeling of what a writer says. Starting in verse 16, Paul writes:
16-18
Let me come back to where I started—and don’t hold it against me if I continue to
sound a little foolish. Or if you’d rather, just accept that I am a fool and let me rant on a little. I
didn’t learn this kind of talk from Christ. Oh, no, it’s a bad habit I picked up from the three-ring
preachers that are so popular these days. . . .
21 Since you admire the egomaniacs of the pulpit so much (remember, this is your old
friend, the fool, talking), let me try my hand at it. . . .
23
(I can’t believe I’m saying these things.
It’s crazy to talk this way! But I started, and I’m going to finish.)
Can you feel what Paul is feeling when he writes those words? He goes back and forth not knowing
exactly how to respond.
Conflict is agonizing. And it is also inevitable. Sometimes we Christians fall for the idea that
if we were just walking closer to the Lord and relying more upon his Holy Spirit, we wouldn’t have
problems with other people. We would always get along with other Christians, and all of our
relationships would be characterized by understanding and compassion.
It is going to be that way in heaven. But in this life conflict is inevitable. It was that way for
the apostle Paul, and it will be that way for us as well. So we need to face it the way that Paul did.
Yes, conflict is agonizing, but let’s not be surprised by it. It is inevitable in this life. So when it
comes time to “answer a fool according to his folly,” let’s do it. Let’s not try to escape from it and run
away—no matter how strongly we’re tempted to do that. Let’s look at the situation for what it is and
address it the way that it needs to be addressed.
Reflections on the Christian Life
We could spend a lot more time on the subject of conflict, and we will probably come back to
it after Easter. But for the rest of this morning let’s look at what Paul goes on to say in 2 Corinthians
11. In verses 21 through 33, Paul spends some time reflecting on his life as a disciple of Jesus
Christ. Let’s follow his line of thinking. It’s not hard to understand what he says in verses 22
through 33, but we need to do more than just think about what he actually writes. We also need to
think about where he is going. What is the point that he is trying to make?
Paul begins with his ethnic and religious credentials. “Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they
Israelites? So am I. Are they Abraham’s descendants? So am I” (2 Cor. 11:22). The “super-apostles”
have apparently paraded the fact that they have a Jewish heritage. Who can explain the Jewish
Messiah better than a Jewish person? So, of course, the “super-apostles” should be listened to.
They are the experts! Paul says, “These guys have nothing on me. I’m Jewish too.” Enough said!
In verse 23, Paul moves to his next subject and asks, “Are they servants of Christ? (I am out
of my mind to talk like this.) I am more” (2 Cor. 11:23a). Now Paul begins to list his record of
Christian service. It is a long list. It runs all the way down to verse 29. He starts by saying that he
has experienced more hardships than the “super-apostles.”
23b
I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely,
and been exposed to death again and again.
24 Five times I received from the Jews the forty
lashes minus one. (2 Cor. 11:23b-24)
In Jewish synagogues people who were guilty of blasphemy would be punished with flogging. But the
Jewish law said that no one could be flogged more than forty times. So just to be careful that they did
not break that law, the synagogue leaders would limit the flogging to “forty lashes minus one.”
25 Three times I was beaten with rods [that was the form of punishment that the Romans
would use], once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and
a day in the open sea, . . . (2 Cor. 11:25)
Can any of the “super-apostles” match Paul’s record of enduring so many hardships?
In verse 26, Paul goes on and talks about how he has lived in constant danger.
I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger
from bandits, in danger from my fellow Jews, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in
danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false believers.
Once again Paul, in effect, asks, “Can any of those ‘super-apostles’ match my record of constant
danger?”
In verse 27 he lists his personal losses. “I have labored and toiled and have often gone
without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold
and naked.”
There is one more aspect to his Christian service that he emphasizes. In verses 28 and 29
he mentions the pastoral pressure that he has experienced. “Besides everything else, I face daily
the pressure of my concern for all the churches. Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led
into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?” Paul loves the Christians in the churches that he started. He
feels the full weight of their struggles and failures.
What a list! More hardships than the “super-apostles.” Constant danger. Personal losses.
And then to top it all off—the pressure of pastoral ministry. Isn’t that enough to earn the respect of
the Corinthians?
Yet there is something strange about this record of Christian service. There’s something
missing here. If Paul is trying to remind the Corinthians of his devotion to Christ in order to regain
their respect, why doesn’t he mention the number of people that he has led to faith in Jesus Christ?
Wouldn’t that be worthy of mention? Why doesn’t he say something about his pioneer missionary
work and how he has taken the good news of Jesus Christ to places where no other Christian
missionary had yet dared to go? Couldn’t he say something about how many miles he has traveled
and the number of cities in which he has preached the gospel? Why doesn’t he say something
about the number of churches across the Roman Empire that owe their existence to him? But Paul
doesn’t say anything about any of that, does he? Why?
The answer is that Paul wants to do more than just defend his reputation. He wants to teach
the Corinthians and us about the Christian life. When it comes to the Christian life, what is it that is
truly worth boasting about? What is most important when it comes to be a disciple of Jesus Christ?
Is it being a gifted speaker? Is it experiencing supernatural revelations from God? What in the
Christian life truly counts in the long run?
Paul gives his answer in verse 30. “If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my
weakness.” What an astounding and counter-intuitive kind of thing to say! “I will boast in my
weakness.” And then Paul gives an example, but before he gives that example, please note that he,
in effect, takes an oath declaring that it is true. “The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is to be
praised forever, knows that I am not lying” (2 Cor. 11:31). Paul swears that this story about how
weak he was is true. He is not making it up. That is a strange oath. You can understand why
someone would take an oath about the truthfulness of a story that makes him look good and noble.
But why would anyone swear about a story that makes him look weak? But that is what Paul does.
He wants the Corinthians to know that he is not making this story up. “In Damascus the governor
under King Aretas had the city of the Damascenes guarded in order to arrest me. But [instead of
bravely staying in Damascus and standing up for my faith] I was lowered in a basket from a window in
the wall and slipped through his hands” (2 Cor. 11:30-33). Paul is saying, “Don’t think of me as
courageous and brave. I was a coward. I slinked out of town like a dog with its tail between its legs.”
“If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.” Paul knows that God can
do what we cannot do. Therefore, there is no shame in being weak and needy. We may be
unimpressive to those who are watching us, but God is not limited. We know that he can do his work.
On Wednesday afternoon I was studying this passage, and I thought particularly about Paul’s
summary statement in verse 30. “If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.”
I have to tell you that I thought, “Really? Really, Paul? We are to boast of our weaknesses?” Did
that make an impression on the Corinthians when they read this letter? Did they read these words
in chapter 11 and say, “Oh, now we understand. Thank you for telling us about how you were such
a coward in Damascus. Now you have our full confidence, Paul!”
“If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.” That sounds good on
Sunday morning when you are in church, but does it really have any relevance to life as soon as you
walk out of this building? I realize that a pastor is not supposed to ask those kinds of questions, but
I do ask them. I went home on Wednesday evening with lots of doubts running through my mind.
That night I happened to watch a video that featured a bishop of the Coptic Church. Do you
know what the Coptic Church is? It is the church in Egypt. It has a long history. The Coptic Church
dates all the way back to the first century. In that video Bishop Angaeolos talked about what life for
Christians in Egypt was like after the Arab Spring. The Muslim Brotherhood won the presidential
election in January of 2011, and the whole country descended into chaos. Unemployment reached
33%. There were fuel shortages. Food prices soared. Crime went up by 60%. People were
attacked. The first attacks were on Sufi and Sunni Muslims. Then Christians started to be attacked.
In fact, more Christians were attacked in the eighteen months after January 2011 than had been
attacked in the preceding twenty years. Lawlessness was rampant.
In August of last year—within the space of 48 hours—there were 50 churches and another
50 Christian organizations that were attacked. The reaction was—according to Bishop Angaeolos—
superhuman. There was not a single act of retaliation. It wasn’t because there was a memo sent
out telling the Christians not to attack. The Christians were just living out their faith. On the burnt
walls of some of the buildings, the Christians wrote, “And it is said to you, ‘Love your enemy.’” Prior
to that time there had been a lot of media rhetoric demonizing the Christians, but when the
Christians refused to retaliate, the same media said, “You Christians confuse us. Be angry! Do
something! Because we don’t understand!”
Bishop Angaeolos said that the Coptic Christians’ reaction came from an understanding of
how God uses weakness. They were thankful for sacrifice. They were thankful for persecution.
They were thankful that their weakness presented them an opportunity for witness to their faith in
Jesus Christ. The Coptic Church has a long history, and they’ve learned over those two thousand
years lessons that we here in the United States have yet to learn. They’ve learned that they can
boast when they are weak because God’s people are in God’s hands.
When things are beyond our ability, God is still at work. So let us boast. We boast not in our
strength. We boast in our God who works in spite of and through our weaknesses.
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",4/6/2014,
"You’ll see in your bulletin this morning a copy of the Evangelical Free Church’s Statement
of Faith. I put that in this week’s bulletin because I want to remind you that we do believe
something! We believe that there are certain things that are true about God.
1 There is a
definiteness to God. We cannot make him into some kind of deity that we happen to find
attractive. God is who he is, and he does not change just to make you and me happy.
This kind of declaration goes against the grain of our culture. Today God is so often
presented as some kind of divine Warm Fuzzy. He just wants everybody to be happy. However
you want to think about him is just fine as long as you find it meaningful. That’s the message that
our culture sends. What we are saying in this Statement of Faith is that God has not revealed
himself to us in such a vague and modernly therapeutic fashion. It’s not that we understand
everything there is to know about God. Certainly not! But God has taught us important truths
about himself that we cannot afford to ignore. God is real! He is just as real and definite as this
pulpit! You and I need to know him for who he actually is.
When we declare that there is truth about God, we are following the example of Jesus and
his apostles. This morning we are going to look at just one example of Paul insisting on the
importance of God’s truth.
When Paul writes his second letter to the Corinthians, he finds himself up against some
religious teachers who have just recently come to the city of Corinth. They have started to exert a
strong influence on the community of believers in that city. There are two problems with these
new teachers. First, they have attacked Paul by saying that he lacks spiritual authority. He is not
an impressive speaker like they are, and he has not had any deep and mystical experiences with
God like they have. So why should the Corinthians waste their time on Paul? He’s so ordinary.
Instead the Corinthians should follow them.
As we saw two weeks ago, Paul does respond to those accusations starting in chapter 10
and then continuing in chapters 11 and 12. “I do not think I am in the least inferior to those
“super-apostles” (2 Cor. 11:5). Paul does defend himself. But he does that not so much because
his pride has been hurt. There is a far more important issue at stake.
The second problem with these new teachers, the “super-apostles,” is not what they are
saying about Paul but what they are teaching about Jesus. When it comes to Jesus neither Paul
nor we can remain silent. Jesus Christ is the center and essence of our faith. We need to resist
anything that diminishes him in our minds and hearts or minimizes his rule over our lives!
Look at the way that Paul tackles this issue. In 2 Corinthians 11:1-15, he stresses three
crucial aspects of our Christian existence, and they all have do with Jesus.
Truth about Jesus
First, he insists on the truth about Jesus. In verse 4 Paul summarizes the major problem
with the “super-apostles.” “For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the
Jesus we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different
gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it easily enough.” There is the problem! Paul
elaborates on the problem again in verses 13-15.
For such people are false apostles, deceitful workers, masquerading as apostles of Christ.
And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their end will be what
their actions deserve.
The “super-apostles” look good and come across as convincing, but they are wrong!
Paul does not provide an exact description of what the “super-apostles” were teaching.
He didn’t need to because the Corinthians, who first read this letter, were aware of what the new
teachers were promoting. You and I cannot be precise about what was being promoted, but we
are not left entirely in the dark either. Whatever exactly it is that they are teaching, it distorts
Jesus and has the potential to deceive the Corinthians. Therefore, Paul has to oppose it because
it does make a difference what you think about Jesus!
One of the turning points in Jesus’ ministry occurs when he asks his disciples, “Who do
you say that I am?” Matthew and Mark and Luke all record that question. Peter responds, “You
are the Messiah, the Son of the living God” (Matt. 9:15-16; Mark 8:29; Luke 9:20). Peter realizes
who Jesus really is! In John’s Gospel we find Jesus himself making some stunning declarations
about himself. “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except
through me.” If you and I were not so familiar with that statement, our mouths would drop open in
astonishment. Who would dare to say that no one can come to God except through him? Jesus
does.
What a contrast Jesus’ and his disciples’ statements are to what we hear today. Our
culture has, in effect, reduced Jesus to a one-dimensional cartoon character who never utters
anything except clichés about love. And the really tragic thing is that Christians often fall for that
simplistic view of Jesus. I recently came across an observation that summarizes so concisely the
problem that we face:
In our day, deception becomes all the easier to arrange because so many Christians are
no longer greatly shaped by Scripture. It is difficult to unmask subtle error when it aligns
with the culture, deploys spiritual God-talk, piously cites a [Bible] passage or two, and
“works.”
2
That analysis is right on target. We are so gullible. We love to hear what Jesus says—
particularly when it fits in with the direction that our society is already going. Then bring the word
spiritual into the conversation somehow. It always sounds good to say that something is spiritual.
Quote a Bible verse out of context, and then talk about how everybody will be happier as a result
of this new insight. That’s the way it works today. No wonder there is so much deception!
What we need to do is read the New Testament. This week I was reading in the Gospel of
Luke. After the Last Supper Jesus and his disciples are walking to the Garden of Gethsemane.
He warns them about how their situation will soon change. He says, “If you don’t have a sword,
sell your cloak and buy one.” But just a short time later when Judas leads the officers of the
temple guard to Jesus so that they can arrest him, one of the disciples takes a sword and cuts off
the ear of the high priest’s servant. Jesus immediately says, “No more of this!”
How do you put that together in your mind? What was Jesus really teaching his disciples
when he told them to buy a sword? Why was he upset when they used one? I’m not going to
answer that question for you. You read Luke 22 and wrestle with it!
Here’s the point: We need to get rid of that one-dimensional cartoon Jesus who mouths
nothing but clichés! Jesus was and still is fully God and fully man. That, in itself, is enough to
baffle our puny human minds. He died on the cross not as a symbol of God’s love but as a
sacrifice that actually satisfied God’s holy wrath and thus provides genuine forgiveness for our
sins. Let’s come to know Jesus as he really is. Please don’t settle for anything less. We need the truth about Jesus, but we cannot stop there. Knowing what is true and what
is false about Jesus is crucial, but Christianity is not just an academic exercise. We also need to
be characterized by devotion to Jesus.
2
I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy. I promised you to one husband, to Christ, so
that I might present you as a pure virgin to him.
3But I am afraid that just as Eve was
deceived by the serpent’s cunning, your minds may somehow be led astray from your
sincere and pure devotion to Christ. (2 Cor. 11:2-3)
In those verses Paul gives us a particular picture of what he wants for the Christians in
Corinth. The picture is not of a classroom but of a wedding. In verse 2 he says, “I promised you to
one husband.” Paul thinks of himself as the father of the bride. Paul is looking forward to the
wedding day. He is filled with emotion and a sense of pride as he thinks about escorting his
daughter down the aisle and presenting her to her groom. But before the wedding day arrives,
some deceitful man comes along and tries to seduce the bride and pull her away from the one that
she is engaged to. Paul, as the father of the bride, says in verse 2 that he is jealous. He’s not
jealous for himself but the groom. In other words, he is going to do everything he can to prevent
his daughter from being deceived and drawn away from her fiancée. Have you got the picture?
Paul uses that picture to describe his role with the Christians in Corinth. The bride is the
church in Corinth, and the groom is Christ. Paul wants to present the believers in Corinth to
Jesus. He is possessed by a “godly jealousy.” He is going to do everything that he can to protect
the Christians from being spiritually deceived and seduced. His goal is to protect the Christians
so that, as it says at the end of verse 3, they will not “somehow be led astray from [their] sincere
and pure devotion to Christ.”
Our goal as Christians is not just to learn about Jesus—as important as that is. The goal
is to love Jesus and to be devoted to him.
When was the last time that you told Jesus that you wanted to know him better? Think of
what Paul writes to the Philippians. “I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his
resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death . . .” (Phil. 3:10a).
Is that your desire too?
When was the last time that you told Jesus that you loved him? I’m not talking about a
breathless “Oh, I’m so in love with you, Jesus!” (Please understand that I have nothing against
“falling in love.” “Falling in love” is one of the most exhilarating experiences of life. But it doesn’t
last forever. “Falling in love” sooner or later grows into another kind of love that is not as
obviously emotional but is just as strong and motivating. It is a kind of devotion that is dedicated
and persevering. It is characterized by loyalty and sacrifice.) When was the last time that you
told Jesus that you love him with that kind of love?
We need to know who Jesus is. We do need to know the truth about Jesus. But we also
need to know him. Our lives need to be characterized by “sincere and pure devotion to Christ.”
So we read the Bible to learn the truth about Jesus, and then we pray. “God, here is what I have
read today about you in your Word. Please take it and teach me more about you. I want to know
you and love you.”
Service for Jesus
Truth about Jesus. Devotion to Jesus. Here’s the third crucial aspect of our Christian
existence: service for Jesus.
In verses 5 through 12 Paul takes on one of the complaints that the “super-apostles” have
against him. It is one that at first strikes us as strange if not downright silly. Paul, they say,
obviously lacks spiritual authority because he does not charge for his services. If he is a real
leader, he would exert his authority by requiring some kind of monetary compensation for his
work among the Corinthians. That’s what the “super-apostles” are saying about Paul. Look at
how he responds.
7Was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of God
to you free of charge?
8
I robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to
serve you.
9 And when I was with you and needed something, I was not a burden to anyone,
for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied what I needed. (2 Cor. 11:7-9a)
Notice what he says next. “I have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will
continue to do so (2 Cor. 11:9b emphasis added). He repeats that idea in verse 12. “And I will
keep on doing what I am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an
opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about” (2 Cor. 11:12 emphasis
added). No apologies. No change of plans. Paul knows how he is serving Jesus and why he is
serving Jesus that way, and he is not going to change.
I can’t help but think that in the days and years ahead we will need to possess that same
sense kind of loyal obedience when it comes to living out our Christian faith. “Here is how I live
for my Lord and Master, and I am not going to change!”
I mentioned earlier that I have been reading the Gospel of Luke, and a few days ago I
came across something that Jesus says that jumped out at me. It’s not something that we here in
this country have needed to think about much, but in the future it may be something that we will
need to pay much more attention to.
22 “Blessed are you when people hate you,
when they exclude you and insult you
and reject your name as evil,
because of the Son of Man.
23
“Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. . . .”
(Luke 6:22-23a)
Our Lord calls us to serve him. Whether the world applauds us or hates us—whether our
friends understand us or ridicule us, our Lord calls us to serve him.
Conclusion
All this week I’ve been following one particular story in the news. In many ways it is a
twenty-first century example of what Paul dealt with in first century Corinth. On Monday, World
Vision, a well-known evangelical Christian ministry to the poor, announced that it would allow
people legally married in a same-sex marriage to serve on the staff of World Vision. The
president of the ministry explained their rationale for making that change in policy. When you first
read their reasons, they did seem to carry some weight.
The Christian community as a whole, however, was not convinced. On Tuesday I made a
phone call to World Vision and expressed my disagreement and disappointment with their
decision. Obviously I was not the only one. On Wednesday afternoon World Vision reversed
their decision and wrote a letter of apology to their supporters. World Vision recognized that they
had made a mistake. They admitted it and repented of it and apologized for it. Thank God!
You and I can learn from World Vision’s experience this week. In the years ahead our
culture will put pressure on us to approve, or, at least, ignore what our Lord says is wrong. And it
will at first sound good and reasonable and even godly. That’s why we need to be prepared to
see through the deception and then stand firm on God’s truth. In order to prepare for what is
coming, we need to know the truth about Jesus; we need to renew our devotion to Jesus, and we
need to continue to give unflinching service for Jesus",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",3/30/2014,
"I’d like to begin this morning by asking you some questions. You probably will not want
to answer them by raising your hand. Just think about them. Has anybody accused you of
doing something wrong this week? Have you gotten into an argument with anybody in the last
seven days? Have you been angry at anybody lately?
If I had asked you to raise your hand in answer to those questions, how many raised
hands do you think that we would have seen around this room?
I find it strangely comforting to know that you have experienced the same emotions that I
have felt. Conflict is something that we all experience. That includes those people that you and
I probably think of as spiritual giants. Even the most famous and godly Christians experience
conflict in their relationships with others. That includes that famous missionary of the first
century—the apostle Paul.
One of the reasons that I decided months ago to preach a series of sermons from 2
Corinthians was a desire on my part to examine how Paul deals with conflict. In 2 Corinthians
10-12, we find Paul in the middle of huge ongoing conflict. I find it fascinating to read this section
of Paul’s letter to the Corinthians and to imagine what Paul must be feeling as he writes these
words. This is not the easiest section of his letter to understand. And it takes even more effort to
think about how this part of the Bible applies to our lives. But it is a fascinating study, and I think
that it can also help us to think about the relationships that we have with other people.
Paul and the Corinthians
Paul’s relationship with the Christians living in the Greek city of Corinth had—to put it
mildly—its ups and its downs. What a stormy relationship! Just read 1 Corinthians, and it is
obvious that here is a church that has a lot of issues that need to be resolved. There is a lot of
disagreement going on within the church, and the Christians there have asked Paul to get
involved. It’s like walking into a hornet’s nest. That’s 1 Corinthians.
Then read 2 Corinthians. By the time he writes this letter Paul has been accused by
some people in the church of being fickle and unreliable (2 Cor. 1:15-17). His ministry is being
challenged and undermined. Questions about Paul reach the point where he feels compelled to
make a special trip to Corinth in order to address the problems, but that visit doesn’t do any
good. Paul later refers to that trip as his “painful visit” (2 Cor. 2:1). It didn’t accomplish
anything. It just made matters worse! So what does Paul do? He decides to send his coworker
Titus to Corinth to see if he can do anything about the problem, and Titus brings back
the good news that the attitude of the Corinthians toward Paul has changed. Thank God!
Things are definitely improving!
But shortly thereafter Paul learns that some new problems have come up. This time the
problems come not from people within the church but from some Christian teachers who have just
recently arrived in Corinth. We read about them in 2 Corinthians 10-12. If you read those chapters
carefully, you learn that these new teachers are really after Paul. Basically they are saying that
Paul lacks spiritual authority. There is no reason to take his teaching and leadership seriously.
These Christian teachers level that accusation against him for three reasons. First, he is
not an impressive speaker (2 Cor. 10:1, 10; 11:6). He writes good letters, but his sermons are
boring! Second, Paul doesn’t talk much about his mystical experiences with God (implied in 2
Cor. 13:1-7a). These new teachers tell exciting stories about visions and revelations that they
have received from God. In comparison, Paul is so ordinary. The third problem with Paul is that
there is nothing about him that commands respect. The main reason they make that specific
accusation may seem to you and me to be kind of strange. The problem with Paul, these
teachers say, is that he preaches for free! He doesn’t charge the Corinthians anything for his
ministry (2 Cor. 11:7-9, 20-21; 12:13). That is a strange accusation, isn’t it? But if you think
about it for a moment, it’s not hard to understand. Remember that old adage that “you get what
you pay for.” That is usually true, isn’t it? If the Corinthians aren’t paying Paul for his ministry, it
is probably a sign that what he’s giving them isn’t worth anything! So why should anybody
waste their time by listening to Paul?
Have you got the picture? Paul lacks spiritual authority. He’s not an impressive
preacher. He experience of God is not anything that’s noteworthy. And the way he carries on
his ministry proves that he is not worth listening to.
Paul refers to these teachers as “super-apostles” (2 Cor. 11:5; 12:11). They are the
“super-Christians,” and he is just Clark Kent. He’s a nobody in comparison to them. So for
three chapters in 2 Corinthians Paul takes on the “super-apostles.” Why does he do that? We
might wonder if he is doing that simply out of pride. His feelings have been hurt, and his
reputation has been tarnished. But is his reputation really that important? Why doesn’t Paul
just overlook these insults like a mature Christian should?
Paul knows that there is a more important issue at stake. It has nothing to do with what
the “super-apostles” say about him. The ultimate problem comes from what they say about
Jesus. “For if someone comes to you and preaches a Jesus other than the Jesus we preached,
or if you receive a different spirit from the Spirit you received, or a different gospel from the one
you accepted, you put up with it easily enough” (2 Cor. 11:4). Paul has no alternative. The
essence of the Christian faith is at stake. These impressive “super-apostles” are distorting the
message of who Jesus is and why he came into this world. Therefore, Paul has to take them on.
Can you feel a little of what Paul must be feeling when he writes this letter? His
relationship to the believers in Corinth has always been plagued with problems. It’s exhausting to
live in perpetual conflict. By the time Paul comes to writing 2 Corinthians 10-12, it is worse than
ever before! People are making accusations about him. They are twisting the message of Jesus
Christ. Paul finds himself right in the middle of a huge conflict, and he cannot simply ignore it.
So what is he going to do? Let’s take a look. Let’s look at what Paul says, and then
step back and think about a question that we should ask ourselves when we are under attack.
2 Corinthians 10:1-6
Paul begins by talking about attitude. “By the humility and gentleness of Christ, I appeal
to you” (2 Cor. 10:1a). Paul could say, “Hey. I’m the apostle around here! You better listen to
me and not those other guys!” Later on in these chapters Paul does talk about his authority, but
he doesn’t start that way. Instead he talks about humility and gentleness. Then he elaborates
on attitude.
3 For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does.
4 The weapons
we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power
to demolish strongholds.
5We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself
up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient
to Christ. (2 Cor. 10:3-5)
Usually when those verses are quoted by Christians, we apply them in a general sense.
We are to “take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ.” Everything that we do and
everything that we think as Christians should be done out of loving obedience to our Lord.
That’s true. That verse can be applied in that general way. But let’s remember that when Paul
is writing these verses, he’s talking specifically about how to behave when you’re in an
argument. Don’t “wage war as the world does.”
In other words, don’t do it in the usual human way. Instead take all those thoughts that
are running through your mind when you are angry at somebody and submit them to Christ.
Don’t think about how you can catch the other person in a mistake.
When you and I are under attack, the question we need to ask is this: Am I responding
in a manner pleasing to God? Am I out to win the argument and beat my opponent, or is my
goal to please God? Am I responding in a manner pleasing to God?
I don’t know about you, but what Paul is talking about in this passage is not something
that comes naturally to me. When I am in an argument, I want to win! And the more heated the
disagreement the more I want to win. Pleasing God? That hardly enters my mind. I want to
trounce my opponent!
This week there was a conference taking place in Palestine—in that “little town of
Bethlehem.” The conference was called Christ at the Checkpoint. The conference was
sponsored by Bethlehem Bible College. Two years ago I had the opportunity to attend that
conference, and I will never forget it. If there is any place in the world, where it is easy to
provoke conflict, it is in the Middle East. Think about Syria and Egypt. Israel and Palestine are
also filled with tension, and they have been for years. So a group of Bible-believing Christians
decide to hold a conference to discuss how Jesus wants his disciples to live in the midst of all
that conflict. What a challenge!
Two years ago I was so impressed that the conference organizers invited other
Christians, with whom they knew that they would disagree, to come and address the
conference. They did the same thing this year. Picture Palestinian Christians inviting Israeli
Christians—Messianic Jews—to come and talk to them about how they should live out their faith
in Christ. It took courage for those Palestinian Christians to issue the invitation, and it took
courage for those Messianic Jews to accept the invitation. There were other Messianic Jews
who thought that it was terrible that their leaders would even meet with Palestinian Christians.
That’s what Paul is talking about here. We don’t wage war as the world does. We don’t
pretend that we always see eye-to-eye. We don’t ignore the things that we need to talk about.
But we listen to each other with respect. We try to understand each other even if we strongly
disagree. Our goal must be to respond in a manner that is pleasing to God.
2 Corinthians 10:7-11
Paul goes on in verses 7 through 11, and he writes about how the Corinthians are
jumping to conclusions and misunderstanding his true intentions. Paul is wrestling with the
issue of consistency.
9
I do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters.
10 For some say, “His
letters are weighty and forceful, but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking
amounts to nothing.”
11 Such people should realize that what we are in our letters when
we are absent, we will be in our actions when we are present. (2 Cor. 10:9-11)
Paul understands why the Corinthians are coming to the conclusions that they have
reached about him. He writes better than he speaks. He writes forcefully in his letters but then
comes across as timid when he is with them in person. The Corinthians interpret that difference
as a sign of him being inconsistent and unreliable. Paul understands that, but also insists that it
is not true. Paul’s principles remain the same even if he is flexible in the way that he applies
those principles. That, in effect, is what Paul says in his defense. But he does understand! He
does understand why the Corinthians may wonder about his ministry.
The question that I find myself asking as I think about Paul’s experience is this: Am I
doing or saying something that could be misunderstood? When I am in an argument with
someone, have I expressed myself as clearly as I am able? Have I used broad generalizations
like “you always . . . ” or “you never . . .” Have I used those expressions even though they do
nothing but make matters worse? Am I doing or saying something that could be
misunderstood?
Years ago I read a book that described how marriages often fall victim to what the author
called “the process of polarization.” A husband and wife have a little disagreement over
something. The wife says something to convince her husband that he’s wrong and she’s right.
The husband, of course, responds. In order to show her that she is the one who is wrong, the
husband overstates his side of the argument. That little disagreement has now grown larger. The
wife interprets her husband’s words as indicating that he is even worse off than she originally
thought. So she restates her position in a forceful manner. He responds in similar fashion. The
gap between them keeps growing larger and larger. Back and forth they go. One forceful
statement produces an even more forceful rebuttal. As each volley of words goes back and forth
between them, the gap grows larger until they are at polar opposites. What started out as a small
and insignificant disagreement has grown into World War III. That’s “the process of polarization.”
Am I doing or saying something that could be misunderstood? That’s a good question to
ask of ourselves in a conflict. We need to ask it of ourselves over and over again. Am I doing
or saying something that could be misunderstood?
2 Corinthians 10:12-18
In the final section of chapter 10 Paul addresses a specific thing that the “superapostles”
have been doing that’s wrong. They are making claims for themselves that they don’t
deserve. Paul is the one who has labored long and hard in Corinth to build up the Christian
community there. Now these new teachers have come in, and they are taking credit for the
spiritual health of the church. So Paul very carefully but firmly sets the record straight.
14 We are not going too far in our boasting, as would be the case if we had not come to
you, for we did get as far as you with the gospel of Christ.
15 Neither do we go beyond our
limits by boasting of work done by others [like some people do]. Our hope is that, as your
faith continues to grow, our sphere of activity among you will greatly expand,
16
so that we
can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you. For we do not want to boast about work
already done in someone else’s territory [like some people do]. (2 Cor. 10:14-16)
As I have been thinking about Paul’s words there, here’s the question that comes to
mind: Am I trying to make myself look better than I am? When I feel under attack, do I respond
by trying to make it look like all the evidence is on my side? Am I trying to make myself look
better than I am?
There are always two sides to every story. Haven’t you discovered that to be true?
Sometimes you listen to a friend describing a problem that he or she is facing. As that friend of
yours explains the various factors that play a role in the difficulty, it always appears that your
friend is in the right. But later on you have the opportunity to hear the other side, and you
discover to your amazement that your friend didn’t mention every factor that is part of this
situation. It is a reminder to you that there are two sides to every story.
That’s true not just with our friends or with other people. It’s true for you and me too.
There are always two sides to the conflicts that we are involved in. Of course, we have a hard
time admitting that because we are so sure that we are right! It’s so obvious to us! But even
when we are right, it is likely that we have not grasped all the dimensions to the problem that we
are dealing with.
That’s why we need to ask questions of ourselves when we find ourselves in a conflict.
Am I trying to make myself look better than I am? Have I overstated my case? Have I
recognized that there is another way of looking at this situation, and I need to acknowledge that?
Conclusion
Conflict is tough, isn’t it? There is no question about that. It is part of life, but it’s no fun
at all.
Look at how Paul ends this chapter. He concludes his thoughts by reminding us of what
he said at the beginning.
17 But, “Let the one who boasts boast in the Lord.”
18 For it is not the one who
commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends. (2 Cor.
10:17-18)
As Christians we need to remember that in every conflict it is not a question of whether you and
I win. What matters is that God wins! Let’s be sure that God gets what he wants whether we
get what we want or not.",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",3/16/2014,
"I like people who are direct. I am not referring to people who are so blunt that they come
across as harsh. I’m thinking of people who know what needs to be said and who know how to
say it. That is what the apostle Paul does in our Scripture passage this morning.
Today we are continuing our study of 2 Corinthians 8 and 9, which make up the longest
single section of the Bible that deals with the subject of giving. As we have seen in our previous
studies, Paul is collecting an offering for the poor Christians who live in the city of Jerusalem.
Paul writes to the followers of Jesus who live in the Greek city of Corinth and urges them to
participate in this offering.
Paul is so direct. He is straightforward and clear. He doesn’t beat around the bush. He
doesn’t pull any punches. He doesn’t apologize for bringing this subject up. He gets right down
to the nitty-gritty. Here is how you and I as believers in Jesus Christ should give to our Lord’s
work. This passage provides us with four adverbs that should describe the way we give. Let’s
identify those four words and then think about whether they apply to our own giving.
Consistently
First, Paul tells us that we should give consistently.
1 There is no need for me to write to you about this service to the Lord’s people.
2
For I know your eagerness to help, and I have been boasting about it to the
Macedonians, telling them that since last year you in Achaia were ready to give; and
your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action.
3 But I am sending the brothers in
order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow, but that you
may be ready, as I said you would be. (2 Cor. 9:1-3)
What’s Paul after when he writes those words? The Corinthians had known about this
collection for the poor for some time. When they had first learned about it, they had gotten
excited. They were enthusiastic about it. But as time wore on, their enthusiasm diminished.
Paul knows that they are not as enthusiastic now as they had been previously. So he writes to
them and sends some of his co-workers to them to encourage them to follow through on what
they had previously said that they were going to do.
Does that sound familiar? Have you ever gotten excited about giving to some good
cause and told yourself that you were going to make some sacrifices and really support that
cause? But then as you paid your own bills and thought about some things that you would like
to buy for yourself, you found that your zeal for that cause was not as strong as it had been
earlier. Can you identify with what the Corinthians were doing? We all can, can’t we? Paul
writes to them and us and says, “Follow through on your giving.”
In other words, be consistent. Planned and regular giving is far better and more
pleasing to God than just responding impulsively to an emotional appeal. Give consistently.
Generously
God’s Word teaches us that we should give consistently. In verse 6 Paul uses another
adverb that should characterize our giving. “Remember this: Whoever sows sparingly will also
reap sparingly, and whoever sows generously will also reap generously” (2 Cor. 9:6 emphasis
added). The word that we should take note of in that verse is, of course, “generously.” God
tells us that we should give generously.
Give generously. Don’t think about how little you can give. Think about how much you
can give. Think about some things that you can do without so that you can give more. Give
generously.
Thoughtfully
We are to give consistently and generously. Verse 7 provides us with contains another
crucial idea. It is one that we will need to take some time to explore. “Each of you should give
what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves
a cheerful giver.” (2 Cor. 9:7). I summarize the idea this way: God wants us to give
thoughtfully.
We are to give thoughtfully. “Each of you should give what you have decided in your
heart to give.” Each one of us is to think through for ourselves what we want to give. We don’t
have to compare ourselves to other people and try to give as much as someone else. It doesn’t
make any difference what the person sitting in front of you gives. God doesn’t expect your gift
to match that person’s. God wants you to decide for yourself. (See also 1 Cor. 16:2; 2 Cor.
8:11-12.) God wants you to be happy about what you give. He knows that you won’t be happy
if you are compelled or forced to give a certain amount. He wants you to be a cheerful giver,
and you will only be that if you have decided for yourself what to give.
Isn’t that liberating? If you are a college student, God doesn’t expect you to give as
much as someone who has enjoyed a prosperous business for decades. Perhaps you’re
married to someone who is not yet a believer in Jesus. He or she is not too crazy about you
giving the family’s money away. Does God understand that? Of course, he does. Do you need
to feel bad that you can’t give as much as someone else? No. God wants you to give what you
in your particular circumstances can give.
It’s worth noting that Paul does not say anything here about giving a tithe. What is a
tithe? A tithe refers to one-tenth of your income. In the Old Testament, the Israelites were
specifically told that they were to give one-tenth of their income to support the worship of God.
They were commanded to give a tithe (Lev. 27:30-33; Num. 18:20-21; Deut. 14:22-29). But
here in 2 Corinthians, Paul doesn’t say that. Paul is writing to converts to the Christian faith
most of whom are probably not from a Jewish background (see Acts 18:1-17). Therefore, they
didn’t know anything about tithing. If there was ever a time to introduce the concept of tithing, it
would have been right here in this letter. But Paul doesn’t say a word about it. Instead, he tells
the Corinthians that they are to look at their income and their wealth and then decide for
themselves how much to give.
I have to tell you that I am hesitant to raise any doubts in anybody’s mind about tithing.
My hesitancy has two sources. First, I think of my own experience. My parents taught me as a
child to give a tithe to the Lord’s work, and I am so glad that they taught me that. I think back to
when Berta and I got married. Like all newlyweds, we were a bit starry-eyed and naïve. We
really didn’t know how much it cost to live. But we decided to give a tenth of our income to God.
We have never regretted that decision. Never! In fact, I have never met a Christian who
regretted giving a tithe.
Here’s the second reason why I am hesitant to question tithing. It’s easy to do the math!
You don’t have to think. Take you income and move the decimal point over one place. Easy!
But if tithing is not the New Testament’s teaching, then we have to think about what we’re going
to give. That takes time and effort. It is so much harder.
You might say to me, “Come on, Fred. You said that you like people who are direct.
Tell me what percentage of my income I’m supposed to give.” I can’t do that because it is your
decision. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t have anything to say on the subject. Here is
something that I think you should consider as you make your decision. God does not expect
you to give more than you are able, but you are probably able to give more than you think.
Spend a few minutes considering that. I daresay that most of us could make some
sacrifices so that we can give more. Don’t go out to eat as often as you do. Pass up a cup of
coffee at Starbucks. Some writers on this subject suggest that we think in terms of what they
call a “graduated tithe.” They recognize that some of us today can give a lot more than a tenth
of our income. We’re out of debt. The children are through college. Financially we are well set.
For those of us in that situation giving 10% is no challenge at all. So how about giving 11% or
12%. Try raising your giving by a percentage point or two each year. For some of us a tithe is a
huge challenge. For others tithing can be an excuse to not give as generously as we can. So
consider the possibility of a “graduated tithe”—one that grows year by year. God does not
expect you to give more than you able, but you are probably able to give more than you think.
Confidently
We’re to give consistently, generously, and thoughtfully. Verses 8 through 11 also tell us
that we should give confidently. We’re to be confident in God’s ability to supply all of our needs
even when we are giving our hard-earned cash away.
8 And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that
you need, you will abound in every good work.
9 As it is written:
“They have freely scattered their gifts to the poor;
their righteousness endures forever.”
10 Now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and
increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness.
11 You
will be enriched in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion, and
through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to God. (2 Cor. 9:8-11)
I have to tell you that part of me is embarrassed by the promises contained in these
verses. Why am I embarrassed? I am not embarrassed by what God says in his Word. But I
am embarrassed by what some people have done with this teaching. You have probably heard
some preacher tell you that if you give $100, God promises you that he will multiply your giving
by ten times. So give $100, and you’ll get $1,000. Give $1,000, and God will give you $10,000
in return. Give $10,000, and God promises you $100,000! That kind of preaching makes me
sick. (Am I being direct enough?)
Paul does not intend these verses to be interpreted as a get-rich-quick scheme for
Christians. He does mention the beneficial aspects of giving. Verse 9 mentions how “God is
able to bless you abundantly,” and Paul is talking there about financial blessing, but in the
second half of that verse Paul explains that the financial blessing is intended to encourage the
Corinthians to “abound in every good work,” not achieve a more luxurious lifestyle. In verse 11
he says that God “will enlarge the harvest of righteousness” in the Corinthians’ lives. God does
bless his children in response to their giving, but the blessing comes in the form of Christ-like
growth in our character, not mathematical growth in our checkbooks balances.
Paul is simply encouraging us to be generous by reminding us that God is mindful of our
giving and that he is more than able to give us what we truly need. If you give generously to the
Lord’s work, he’ll take care of your needs. You don’t need to be afraid of that. You can give
confidently. God knows more about your income and your checkbook and your future needs
than you do. If you love him and you are giving to his work, then you can be sure that he will be
generous to you. So give confidently.
There’s the teaching. Give consistently. Give generously. Give thoughtfully. And give
confidently.
Every time I preach on this subject, somebody—in fact usually more than just one or two
people—will come up to me and say, “Thank for preaching that, Fred. What you talked about is
exactly what we’ve experienced. We are so glad that we learned how to tithe and give.”
So this morning I’ve asked a couple in our church to tell us a little about their experience.
I’m so thankful that Vic and Carol Hagstrom agreed to do so.
Vic: When Pastor Fred asked us to talk about giving, I really hesitated because money
and giving are such personal things. What I have to say today should not be considered a
formula that will work for everyone, but just something that worked for us.
In the first few years of our married life, giving was not in the picture at all. I thought of
the church as a big institution that somehow just ran itself. Besides—I still had a year of college
left, and we already had a child with another one coming.
Carol: By the time all three of our children had arrived, we were in a small town in Iowa
attending a wonderful Baptist Church. We rather liked the pastor and soon began to feel badly
that we weren’t helping in his ministry. So we started giving, maybe five or ten dollars a week,
but we gave regularly. We hoped God would multiply that amount exponentially. (See the words
you learn when married to an accountant.)
Vic: Eight years into the marriage and with three kids in school, we started to think about
tithing. How on earth could we do that? We really were not wasting any money any place. Carol
came up with the idea that we just give our raise every year and see if God would help us live on
what we were living on already. We committed to doing that. A few years down the road we hit
the tithe. Later that doubled and then tripled. We lived for ten years on the same income.
Carol: Poor Vic. He had two big problems. First, he didn’t have a big salary back then—
forty years ago. Second, he had a wife that was not very good with money. I like to think that if
there are checks in the checkbook, there is money in the bank! So then, how did we manage?
Well, we didn’t manage. God did—in so many wonderful ways. I had rented and rented and
wanted my own home with this and that. One of the first homes we looked at—I wanted it
immediately. It is the home in the country that we live in still today. It had an apartment next to it.
We rented that apartment out, and that rental payment made our house payment. How does one
heat a big house like that for six months out of the year? We heated with wood, and it became
one of the summer family activities to find windrows full of trees that had been plowed down. We
would go there and chop the wood up and bring it home. I was free for nothing except the work.
When our washing machine broke down and couldn’t be fixed any more, there was an
unbelievable sale at Sears. And on and on. God stretched that income to give us the things we
needed and some of the things we wanted.
Vic: But like I already said, this is not necessarily something that will work for everyone.
But it did work for us. I think the main thing is to establish some routine giving pattern—no matter
how small—and then stick to it. Bring it up as soon as possible. The Lord will bless you for it.
Conclusion
Let’s conclude with one final consideration. When is the best time to establish a pattern
of giving? The answer is “Right now!” Don’t wait until you have “enough” money because there
will never be “enough” money. There will always be something that comes up that will delay
your good intentions. The time to start giving is right now.
Let me put it another way. It will never be easier for you to start giving than it is right
now. You may say, “But it wouldn’t be easy for me to start giving right now. If you only knew,
Pastor Fred, how many bills I’ve got to pay!”
Please listen to me carefully. I didn’t say that it would be easy for you to start right now.
I just said that it wouldn’t be any easier later on. Something will always come up that will make
you think you should start later. Please don’t delude yourself into thinking that it will be easier
later on. It won’t be. Start now to learn the joy of giving.
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",3/9/2014,
"As I mentioned earlier in our service, it was good to be in France a couple of weeks ago in
order to visit with our missionaries, Michael and Emilie Gibbons. The purpose of the visit was to
participate in their team’s annual retreat. I had the opportunity to deliver three messages to them over
that weekend, and I hope that God used those messages to help them understand his Word better.
The best part of being with the Gibbons was the opportunity to see the work that they do in
the city of Toulouse. France is a spiritually dark country. We probably don’t think of it that way
because we know that France has a strong Catholic history, but today the French people are
uninterested and skeptical—if not downright hostile—to Christianity. Many of the young people
whom the Gibbons have developed relationships with have never given faith in Jesus Christ any
serious consideration. The reason is that they have never met anybody who has expressed a
genuine faith in Christ. The Gibbons and the other members of their team are the first Christians
that those people have ever met.
Being a missionary in France is a huge challenge, and Michael and Emilie have done an
excellent job in pulling together a team of workers to present the gospel there. Team members
come from the United States, England, France, and Hong Kong. It is an international team of
missionaries. They have carefully thought through their strategy on how to earn people’s confidence
so that they can talk to them about Jesus. I found their ministry to be very impressive. In fact,
another Free Church missionary who was at the retreat said to me over breakfast one morning,
“There is no team in all of Europe like the Toulouse team.”
There is much more that I would like to tell you about their ministry, but that will have to
suffice for right now. I am happy to report that the Gibbons are doing an excellent work in France,
and I am so glad that we as a church are partners with them in their ministry. They are worthy of all
the support that we can give them.
I’d like us now to think about another missionary in Europe. His name is Paul. Have you
ever heard of him? We often refer to him as the apostle Paul.
This morning we are resuming our study of the letter that Paul writes to the Christians living
in the Greek city of Corinth. We are in the midst of the section of his letter that begins in chapter 8
verse 1 and runs all the way through chapters 8 and 9. In these two chapters Paul writes about a
collection of money that he is gathering to take to the poor Christians living in Jerusalem. These
chapters of 2 Corinthians are the longest section of teaching about giving that we find any place in
the New Testament, and they are so instructive.
The particular part that we will be studying this morning may seem at first to be somewhat
removed and almost irrelevant. Paul writes about his co-worker, Titus, and two other Christian
brothers. Paul is sending these three Christian men from Macedonia in the northern part of what we
call Greece down to the city of Corinth in the south of Greece. The purpose of their trip is to
encourage the Corinthians to follow through on their previously expressed desire to participate in the
offering that Paul is collecting to take to the poor Christians in Jerusalem. That is what 2 Corinthians
8:16-9:5 is all about. What does that have to do with you and me here in the twenty-first century?
The more I reflect on this passage the more thought-provoking I find it to be. Here is a
snapshot of how the apostle Paul handles money, and his example should speak to us.
Money always sends a message. It does not just pay the bills. The way that we handle
money says something about us and the kind of people that we are. It says something about how
mature and responsible we are. Money also says something about our priorities and what we think
is really important in this life. Let’s look at the example of Paul and the early Christians and then ask
some questions about the messages that we are sending with our money.
What does your money say about your character?
In this passage we find Paul sending Titus and two unnamed Christian brothers to Corinth.
Look at how Paul describes them. He emphasizes their character.
16 Thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same concern I have for you.
17 For Titus not only welcomed our appeal, but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm
and on his own initiative. (2 Cor. 8:16-17)
Paul does not send Titus on this mission to Corinth just because he happens to be available for the
job. Titus wants to go and help gather this collection. He is enthusiastic about this ministry to the
poor in Jerusalem, and he has taken the initiative to talk to Paul about how he can participate.
Now look at the way that Paul describes the first of the other two men who are going along
with Titus. “And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his
service to the gospel” (2 Cor. 8:18). Once again we see that there is a reason why Paul sends this
man. He has earned a good reputation—not just in Paul’s eyes and not just in one of the churches
that Paul has started but in a number of different churches. He is “praised by all the churches for
his service to the gospel.”
Both Titus and this first brother have earned the early Christians’ respect. The same is true
for the second brother that Paul sends to the Corinthians. “In addition, we are sending with them our
brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous, and now even more so
because of his great confidence in you” (2 Cor. 8:22). When it comes to this second brother, once
again we find Paul describing him in terms of his character.
There is a relationship between money and character. You do not entrust your money to
someone unless you have a reason to trust that person. Isn’t that true? You and I would be fools to
turn over our hard-earned cash to someone that we don’t have reason to trust. It works the other
way too. The manner in which you and I handle our money says something about our character.
Let’s spend a few minutes thinking about that relationship between money and character. Here’s
the question we should ask: What does your money say about your character?
We could think about that in terms of how we pay our bills. Do you make it a habit of paying
your bills on time? What does that say about your character? Or think about it in terms of taxes.
Do you pay the taxes that you owe? What does your tax return say about your character? Have
you reported all your income? Have you taken bigger deductions that you were legally entitled to?
Every year I struggle with taxes. I really do. I believe that I am obligated before God to pay
the taxes that I owe. That is not just a responsibility that I have to the government. As a Christian I
know that it is also a responsibility that I have to God (Rom. 13:7). God expects me to pay what I
owe—whether I enjoy doing it or not. On the other hand, I do not believe that there is a special virtue
in paying the government more than I owe. So I try hard to find every legal exclusion and deduction
that I can possibly qualify for. Sometimes I do wonder about that. This year I donated some old
cabinets to the Habitat for Humanity’s ReStore over in the industrial park, and I wondered exactly
what size deduction I could claim for those cabinets. I didn’t want to claim too much or too little.
Every year right before I send my taxes in, I pray. I tell God that I believe that I have completed
them properly. I acknowledge that I am not absolutely sure right down to the last penny, but I believe
that I have done them ethically. I tell God that if he knows that I am deceiving myself and that I
haven’t been as ethical as I think I’ve been, then I want him to show me what I need to change.
Here’s the point: There is a relationship between our money and who we are. We need to
consider that. What does your money say about your character?
What does your money say about your maturity?
Look at 2 Corinthians 8 again. Here is what I find most interesting about this passage. It
demonstrates the way that Paul manages the financial gifts that are entrusted to him. I find this
fascinating. Here is the evidence that in the first century—two thousand years ago—money
management is important.
Please follow along with me as we piece the evidence together. Look again at the way that
the first unnamed brother is described. Verse 18 says something about his personal character, but
verse 19 brings the Christian community as a whole into the picture.
18 And we are sending along with [Titus] the brother who is praised by all the churches for his
service to the gospel.
19 What is more, he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as
we carry the offering, which we administer in order to honor the Lord himself and to show our
eagerness to help. (2 Cor. 8:18-19)
This man has been given the task of receiving the Christians’ offerings for the poor in Jerusalem not
just by the apostle Paul but also by the churches where the money has been collected. In that way
the people in those churches can be confident that the money will actually be used for the purpose
that it was given. They aren’t giving their money to some stranger that Paul happens to recommend
to them. They are putting their money into the hands of someone that they know and trust. We find
that same point being made in verse 23. “As for Titus, he is my partner and co-worker among you;
as for our brothers, they are representatives of the churches and an honor to Christ.”
We find further confirmation of this wise management of money in the book of Acts. In
chapter 20 verse 4 of Acts, we discover the names of the people are who go along with Paul when
he takes this gift to Jerusalem. Their names and their home towns are listed.
He was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from
Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy [from Lystra (Acts 16:1-2)] also, and Tychicus and
Trophimus from the province of Asia [which included the cities of Ephesus and Colossae].
(emphasis added)
Put all of the evidence 2 Corinthians and Acts together, and you see that Paul is very careful
and deliberate about the way he handles money. He doesn’t take all the money himself because he
knows that if he does that he will be opening himself up to accusations of corruption. Instead he
sets up a system so that the Christians in all the churches that have made contributions can be sure
that the money is going to be handled ethically. The people in Berea can have confidence that their
gifts will get to Jerusalem because they have chosen Sopater, a man who has earned their trust, to
take it. The people in Thessalonica can be confident because they know that Aristarchus and
Secundus are trustworthy. The same will be true for every church that gives toward this collection.
1
Paul explains the underlying principle in 2 Corinthians 8:20-21:
20 We want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift. For we are taking
pains to do what is right, not only in the eyes of the Lord but also in the eyes of man.
Here’s the point: Money needs to be managed carefully.
We try to do that here in our church. For example, that’s one of the reasons we have
congregational meetings. Those business meetings are not the most thrilling parts of church life. Let’s
admit that. But they are good and necessary. At those meetings our church administrator provides a
written report on what funds have been given and what has been spent. The members of the church
have the opportunity to ask questions, and we should ask questions. Accountability was important in
the first century churches, and money management is important in today’s churches as well.
Let’s make this personal. What does your money say about your financial maturity? I
struggled over what term to use in that question, but I think that “maturity” summarizes the idea best.
Being financially mature doesn’t mean that you are rich, and it doesn’t even mean that you are out of
debt. It means that you have a plan. You’ve looked at where you are financially, and you have a
plan on where you want to go. So what does your money say about your maturity?
Every time I meet with couples for premarital counseling, I always talk to them about money.
I ask those couples lots of questions. Do they have credit cards? How much do they owe on those
credit cards? How much total debt do they have? What steps are they taking to pay off that debt? What kind of insurance do they have? What kind of insurance will they need in the future? Do they
know where they are presently spending their money? Have they created a budget for themselves
once they get married? Have they talked about how they are going to plan for retirement?
I always feel kind of sorry for asking those questions. Picture a young couple who are madly
in love, and the pastor talks to them about retirement plans! What does that have to do with
romance? I ask all those questions not because I’m nosy or because I want to scare those young
couples to death. (Well, I do want to scare them a little bit.) I ask those questions primarily because
I know that nothing creates problems faster in marriage than money. Problems with money are so
immediate. You cannot avoid them for long. You have to face them sooner or later. (And the
sooner you face them the better.)
Good money management is crucial for maintaining health in a marriage. It is a sign of
maturity. It doesn’t mean that you have no financial challenges. It simply means that you have a
plan on how to deal with those challenges. I often tell young couples that making money is not
nearly as important as managing money. (I know that is a broad generalization. You cannot
manage money unless you first make it. But the general principle still stands true. Making money is
not as important as managing money.)
The Bible gives us examples of money management. We have looked at just one example
today.
2 God wants us to practice good financial management because he loves us and wants what
is best for us. I am so glad that here in our church we have some people who teach the class called
Financial Peace University. Getting out of debt is so important. If you are in financial trouble, please
go and get some help. It takes a lot of humility to admit that you need that help. But please go and
talk to someone you trust who can help you make a plan and take steps toward financial maturity.
What does your money say about God?
I suspect that some of you here today are surprised at all this talk about money. You came
to church expecting to hear about God, and instead you walked into what seems like an investment
seminar instead.
I’ll repeat what I said at the beginning. Money always sends a message. We send a
message to ourselves through our money. If we will listen to that message, we’ll learn something
about who we are. We also send a message to other people. They can look at how we deal with
money and learn something about our maturity. Money also sends a message to God. The key
verse of this passage is 2 Corinthians 8:21. Paul reminds us that money sends a message to two
directions—horizontally and vertically. “We are taking pains to do what is right, . . . in the eyes of the
Lord [and] also in the eyes of man.” Our money sends a message to other people, and it also sends
a message to God.
So here is the final and most important question for the morning: What does your money say
about God? Are you seeking to honor God by the way that you use your money?
Years ago there was a Dutch theologian who made a powerful and memorable statement
about Jesus being the Lord of this earth. “There is not an inch in the whole area of human existence
of which Christ, the sovereign of all, does not cry, ‘It is Mine!’”
That is absolutely right! Jesus is the Lord of all! He is Lord of our lives and Lord of our
money. So let’s make it our goal to honor our Lord in everything we do—down to the very last penny!

",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",3/2/2014,
"This morning I’d like to ask a simple question: is Jesus a heretic?
Yes, you heard me right. “Is Jesus a heretic?” Here’s where I’m coming from when I ask that
question. How would you respond if someone walked up to you and asked how he or she could
receive eternal life? Would you tell them “Go and give all your money to the poor, and you will have
treasure in heaven?” Probably not, right? You’d explain the gospel to them. You’d say “You just need
to confess your sins to Jesus and make a decision to trust in him as your Lord and Savior.” To say that
they needed to give away their money would be a form of works salvation. That’s a heresy, right? And
yet that’s exactly what Jesus says in this passage. So, is Jesus a heretic?
I hope that you brought rotten vegetables to church today. You’re going to need them! But in all
seriousness, as a younger Christian I really wrestled with this passage. I have always been taught,
again and again, that salvation is by grace, not by works. Isn’t that the heart of the gospel message? I
like it when Jesus says simple things like “God so loved the world that He gave his only son, that
whoever believes in him will not perish but have everlasting life.” But what Jesus says here is so much
more confusing. After all, it seems like the rich young man is asking Jesus such a straightforward
question: “What must I do to inherit eternal life?” Why does Jesus have to throw such a curveball at us?
We shouldn’t be afraid to admit that Christ’s words can be confusing sometimes. They had the
same affect on the people he met back when he was on earth! We see situations like this a lot in the
Gospels. Someone approaches Jesus and asks him some kind of question. Sometimes they’re
looking for a straightforward answer, like when John the Baptist’s disciples asked Jesus if he was the
messiah or if they should look for someone else. Sometimes, we see people approach Jesus with an
agenda or to trick him into saying something that will get him in trouble, like when the Pharisees asked
him about paying taxes to Caesar. In either case, Jesus doesn’t seem to cater to other peoples’
expectations or let them set the agenda. Instead, he uses the conversation to unveil what is truly in a
person’s heart and expose the truths that they need to hear. This morning we are going to see how
Jesus does this for the rich young man. I hope we will see how Jesus does this for each of us as well.
Let’s start by looking at one of the first surprising things that Jesus says. After the rich young
man asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life, Jesus responds not by telling him that he needs
to have faith or trust in him, but instead by referring to these Old Testament commandments. After the
man claims that he has kept the commandments, Jesus seems to poke a hole in his self-confidence.
But he doesn’t do this by telling the man to believe in him rather than trying to follow the law. Instead,
Jesus tells him “There’s one thing you have left to do: go, sell everything you own and give to the poor,
and you will have treasure in heaven.” What a strange thing to say!
But Jesus doesn’t stop there. After the rich young man leaves, Jesus comments to his disciples
about how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God. Then he emphasizes his point even more
strongly by saying that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to
enter God’s kingdom. Now, it has sometimes been suggested that in ancient Jerusalem there was a
tiny door in the wall called “the eye of the needle”, and that in order for someone to get their camel
through, they needed to get off and remove the baggage from the camel’s back. Then, just barely, the
camel would be able to get through by stooping down on its knees. So, according to this interpretation,
Jesus was saying that the rich could get into the kingdom of God, with some uncomfortable wiggling.
The problem is that this story is almost certainly untrue. Scholars agree that Jesus was talking
about a sewing needle; the kind of needle that requires you to squint just to get a thread through. How
would you like to see a camel wiggle through that? So what was Jesus saying here? That entrance to
heaven is based on income? To be saved, you have to obey the commandments and give to the poor.
That’s the message. Or is it?
You see, Jesus has a way of getting right to the heart of an issue. He didn’t come to earth to
teach theology 101. And in this instance, Jesus doesn’t give this man a lecture on the theology of
salvation. And why doesn’t he? I would suggest that it’s because that’s not what this man really needs.
Of course, he does need to have faith in Jesus, but something is already getting in the way of that, and
Jesus recognizes it.
For one thing, the young man seems pretty confident about his upright living. “All these
commandments I have kept since I was a boy.” He says. That makes you wonder why he wanted to
get advice from Jesus in the first place, if he already thought he was doing fine. Did he just want a pat
on the back from a rabbi? Whatever was going on in this man’s mind, Jesus responded to him a lot
better than I would have. I might have said something like “hold on a minute there; doing good works
won’t get you into heaven. You need to confess your sins and trust in Christ. You need to pray the
sinner’s prayer!” But Jesus was a lot more subtle than that. He used a well-placed probe to expose
where this man’s heart was at. And he hit him at his weak spot: his wallet.
You see, whether or not the size of his money-bags would keep him out of heaven wasn’t quite
the point. The point was that he seemed to care more about maintaining his wealth than about
pursuing the heart of God. He didn’t get the affirmation or the pat on the back or the vague spiritual
answer that would have been so comfortable. He got an invitation to change his outlook on life from
one that was centered on meeting his own needs, to living for something larger than himself. An
invitation to lay down what he cared about most and to take hold of what matters most to God.
Now, the young man could have responded in a number of ways to this instruction “Sell all that
you have, give to the poor, and follow me.” He could have just done it. He could have said, “Jesus,
that’s too hard; please help me; give me a place to start!” He could have said “I am a sinner and I see
that my heart is in the wrong place; please change me!” We can only speculate, but my guess is that
Jesus would have welcomed any of those responses. After all, the disciples weren’t perfect, and Jesus
accepted them. But the rich young man didn’t respond at all. He just walked away, because he felt
that he needed his money more than he needed Jesus. So Jesus wasn’t going to talk to this man
about being saved by grace. At least not up front. Grace wasn’t what this man really wanted. He
wanted to maintain his status quo. He wanted the affirmation that he was okay the way he was. He
didn’t get that, so he left.
At this point it’s easy for us to be critical of this man for walking away from Christ because he
was too stuck on his money. But maybe, we have more in common with him than we would care to
admit. Like the rich young man, we can often think that we’ve got it made spiritually because we are
following the rules, giving our tithe, minding our theological p’s and q’s. And yet, in the midst of our
desire to be good people, have we overlooked the things that matter most to God? Or perhaps I should
ask the question this way: what have we actually been willing to give up in order follow Christ?
Now we rightly take comfort God’s grace; in knowing that because of Christ we don’t have to
perform some quota of good works to have fellowship with God. After all, grace is the answer (the only
answer!) to our problem as sinful people. Yes, grace is the answer: but are we asking the right
question? Grace is certainly what we need, but is grace really what we want? Do we really want to be
saved from the sin that keeps us from the heart of God, or do we just want an insurance policy that lets
us off the hook so we can live however we like, feeling safe in our comfortable lives? Are we too much
like the rich young man in that we are more interested in getting an affirmation that we are okay just the
way we are, than we are in receiving the new life, free from sin, that God offers us? Do we want to
follow Jesus only under the condition that he’s not going to ask anything of us?
Now, this young man’s love of money and his desire to maintain his status quo rather than face
the reality of his own sin was a big problem for him. He had a big roadblock in the way of following
Christ and caring about the things that God cares about. But when we take a closer look, we see an
even more subtle problem facing the young man.
It shows up right away when he approaches Jesus. He calls him “good teacher.” This might not
sound particularly remarkable, but Jesus picks up on it and asks him why he called him that. After all,
nobody but God is really good.
Now some people have used this statement to argue that Jesus never claimed to be divine. He
says it right here! “Only God is good, so don’t call me that!” But this statement has more to do with the
young man’s ignorance and presumption about who Jesus was. In effect, Jesus was asking “do you
really believe that I am God, or are you just trying to flatter me? Don’t go around calling people good
unless you know who they really are.” Clearly, this man didn’t really know who he was talking to. It
seems as though he was just looking for some advice from a good teacher on how he could add some
finishing touches to his already good life and feel a little more secure about his eternal future.
But that’s not what he got. Whether he realized it or not, what he got was an encounter with the
living God, Jesus Christ. And Jesus gave a very direct answer to his question about what he needed to
do to have eternal life. It turned out that what he needed to do was just the thing he couldn’t do. You
see, the rich young man had gone to the wrong person. He went to Jesus, the good teacher. What he
needed was Jesus, the gracious God. And what is impossible with good teachers is possible with our
gracious God.
That’s what the rich young man missed. He didn’t grasp the extent of his own spiritual
neediness, nor did he grasp the saving power of God. This threw the disciples for a loop, too. When
Jesus said “How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God”, they were astounded. According to
the way that most Jews at that time thought, the wealthy were those whom God had blessed. Having
material blessings was an indication that you were a good person in God’s sight.
That was a popular idea two-thousand years ago, and it’s a popular idea today as well.
Nowadays, we call it “the prosperity gospel”. In essence, this teaching claims that living in obedience to
God, having enough faith, or praying the right kind of prayers will assure financial prosperity. Now,
there’s a grain of truth to this, because a life of faithful obedience and dependence on God does tend to
result in us making wise decisions that make our lives better. But what Jesus says here reminds us
that there is no such guarantee. In fact, Jesus suggested that the opposite was the case: this man’s
faith and obedience wasn’t making him wealthy; his wealth was getting in the way of his faith and
obedience. This insight astonished the disciples even more when Jesus drove the point home when he
said that it was easier for a large beast of burden to squeeze through the thread-hole of a needle than
for a wealthy person to become a member of God’s kingdom. The point is clear: it’s not just hard for a
rich person to be saved; it’s impossible!
The disciples get the point. And they ask the next logical question: if it’s impossible for the rich
to enter the kingdom, then isn’t it really impossible for anyone to be saved? “That’s right.” Says Jesus.
“With man, this is impossible.”
Could that be right? That salvation is impossible? Yes, impossible! Impossible as creating the
universe out of nothing. Impossible as parting the Red Sea. Impossible as a virgin conceiving and
giving birth to God in the flesh. Impossible as a man rising from the dead. Yes, salvation is impossible.
But we have a God who specializes in the impossible. And maybe, if he can do all of these other
miraculous things, he can pull off the greatest miracle of all: reconciling sinners like you and me to
himself. For humans, this is impossible. But with God, all things are possible.
That was part of this rich young man’s problem. He approached Jesus as a good teacher when
he really needed a gracious God. He had a problem with money. His wealth had a hold on his heart.
He couldn’t turn himself around. And neither can any of us. Whether our problem is with greed, or lust,
or pride, or selfishness, we cannot wiggle our way into God’s favor, any more than a camel can wiggle
through the hole in a needle.
That’s why it won’t work to treat Jesus simply as a great teacher who lived two thousand years
ago. It’s common to hear people talk like that now; to respect Jesus as a good teacher but not
acknowledge him as Lord. And while we, as believers, rightly disagree with the view that Jesus was
nothing but an insightful rabbi, sometimes I think that we also fall prey to this kind of thinking. Like the
rich young man, we often want to somehow use Jesus for our own purposes. Sometimes we want to use
his teachings as just another tasty ingredient to toss into our personal religious soup. We treat him like a
friendly guru who can help us achieve a more virtuous, well-balanced life. Alternatively, sometimes we
try to use Jesus and the grace he gives us through the cross as some kind of spiritual get-out-of-jail-free
card; as an excuse live however we like. In either case, we’re really using Jesus as a means to achieving
our own goals. But Jesus doesn’t settle for that: he wants to be the goal. He’s not an ally whom we can
recruit for our cause. He’s our Lord, and he has saved us so that we can live for his cause!
This morning, we’ve really looked over this passage in Mark. We’ve wrestled with these
challenging words of Jesus. Maybe his words have wrestled with us! But now I’d like to try and pull
some of these things we’ve talked about together as we wrap up.
I’ll sum up what we’ve found out this way: the rich young man that we read about in this
passage had two basic problems. His first problem was his love of money. His great wealth had the
effect of blinding him to his own need for Christ. He came to Jesus asking about how he could inherit
the Kingdom of God, but Jesus unmasked the reality that this man really cared more about being
comfortable in the little kingdom that he had built for himself on earth than he did about receiving God’s
kingdom, which lasts forever.
His love of money that blinded him from his need for Christ was his first problem. His second
problem was that he failed to recognize who Jesus really was. To him, Jesus was just a good teacher
who could advise him on what to do in order to be saved. But no amount of doing has ever saved
anyone. That’s because being saved is not about what you do, but who you know. This man’s quest
for a good teacher who would help him on his own terms caused him to miss out on a chance to get to
know and follow the gracious God who really could help him in the way he needed most.
It turns out that the rich young man’s problems can be big problems for us too. Not many of us
have vast riches such as this man had, but most of us probably have enough to stay fairly comfortable
in life. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with that. We should thank God for the blessings that he gives
us. But there’s something about being comfortable in this life that can lull us into a false sense of
security. It can insulate us from our true state of desperate need for God. We need to ask ourselves
“what have I been willing to give up in order to follow Christ?”
It’s also easy for us to share the rich young man’s second problem. We approach Jesus as a
good teacher rather than a gracious God. We accept his words as advice for helping us touch up our
lives here and there. We claim his love for us as nothing but an encouraging pat on the back or
affirmation that we’re okay the way we are and really don’t need to change. But for the most part we
carry him around like the spare tire in our trunk that’s there in case of an emergency, as we seek to rely
on ourselves the rest of the time. We treat him like a fire insurance policy or just a ticket that gets us
through the pearly gates. But the problem is that salvation isn’t just hard. It’s impossible. We need more
than a good teacher. We need a gracious God; a gracious God who deserves our entire devotion.
So, let’s go back to the question we asked at the beginning of this message: is Jesus a heretic?
Well, of course he isn’t, because a heretic is someone who rejects the truth of God. Jesus is fully
divine. He embodies the truth of God, so he can’t be a heretic. And neither was he teaching that we
are saved by works or by giving away our money. He was exposing how this man’s possessions had
blinded him from seeing his need for God and how he wasn’t really interested in receiving the grace he
needed but in getting advice that he could apply to his life on his own terms.
That seems like a good place to close, but there’s one last thing I just have to mention. In verse
21, the narrator interjects a powerful little comment: he says “Jesus looked at him and loved him.”
Now, this man loved his earthly possessions more than he loved Jesus. He approached Jesus merely
as a good teacher who could help him rather than Lord to whom he owed everything and the savior that
he so desperately needed. We’ve recognized how these mistakes separated this man from his savior
and caused him to reject the grace that was offered to him. But even still, Jesus looked at him, and
loved him. We read that this man turned away and left with great sorrow in his heart. But I think that
Jesus was sad too. He wanted to welcome this man into the kingdom with open arms.
So here’s my final point this morning. Don’t walk away from Jesus. Maybe you feel convicted
by what you’ve heard this morning. I know that I certainly feel convicted. But don’t waste your
conviction. Don’t turn away and hide from the love of Christ. The Lord who rebukes our sin and
condemns the idols of our hearts is the same Lord who is longing—pleading—imploring us to turn to
him and be set free. After all, he’s not just a good teacher. He’s our gracious God. He’s in the
business of doing the impossible for us. And he’s waiting with open arms.",Micah Carpenter,"Bemidji, MN",2/23/2014,
"In order to prepare ourselves for the Lord’s Supper this morning we are going to look at
a passage of the Bible whose main subject is money. To be more specific it is about giving
money away. You might wonder what that has to do with the Lord’s Supper. It does seem a
little strange, doesn’t it? I agree. But there is a connection, and it is an important one.
This morning we are continuing our study of 2 Corinthians, and we come to the part of
Paul’s letter where he gives instructions to the Christians living in the Greek city of Corinth about
giving. That is the topic that starts in 2 Corinthians 8:1 and runs all the way thought the end of
chapter 9. Just look at those two chapters in your Bibles. This is a long section of Paul’s letter,
and it is all about giving. In fact, this passage is the longest single passage in all of God’s Word
on the subject of giving.
As we will see, it is a remarkably thorough discussion of the subject. Paul discusses so
many different aspects of the subject. In chapter 8 verses 1 through 9, he begins with the
motivation for giving. Why should the Corinthians in the first century and why should you and I
in the twenty-first century give away our hard-earned cash? Good question!
Paul answers that question by citing two examples. First, he mentions the
Macedonians. Paul is writing this letter from Macedonia or what we think of today as the
northern part of Greece. In order to encourage the Corinthians in the southern part of Greece to
be generous, he cites the example of the Christians living there in Macedonia.
1 And now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace that God has
given the Macedonian churches.
2
In the midst of a very severe trial, their overflowing joy
and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity.
3 For I testify that they gave as
much as they were able, and even beyond their ability. Entirely on their own,
4
they
urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the Lord’s people.
(2 Cor. 8:1-4)
In verse 2 Paul mentions two noteworthy things about the believers in Jesus who live in
Macedonia. First, they are going through severe trials. Paul does not elaborate on what those
trials are, but he’s probably referring to persecution. If you read chapters 16 and 17 of the book
of Acts, you learn very quickly about the opposition that the Christians living in Macedonia faced
(Acts 16:19-24; 17:5-9, 13).
First, they are persecuted. Second, they are poor. Paul mentions their “extreme
poverty.” That probably is a result of the persecution. They are looked down upon as worthless
and insignificant because of their faith in that Jesus they talk about so much. The non-Christian
community thinks of these Christians as fools. That attitude sooner or later translates into the
kinds of jobs they can get and the amount of money they can earn. Here are Christians who are
persecuted and poor—yet generous. Paul cites their giving as an example to the Corinthians.
Stories about others have a way of shaking us out of our complacency. Isn’t that true?
Think of that famous story in Luke 21 about the widow who only has two small copper
coins in her possession. That is all she has in the world! Jesus and his disciples watch the rich
put lots of money into the temple treasury. Then the widow comes and gives her two small
copper coins. Jesus says, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all the others.
All these people gave their gifts out of their wealth; but she out of her poverty put in all she had
to live on” (Luke 21:1-4). No matter how many times you’ve heard that story—it makes you stop
and think, doesn’t it?
I think of a woman that I met when I first moved here to Bemidji. Some of you will
remember her. She died thirty-one years ago this month, but I still remember her so well. Her
name was Hattie Kortekamp, but everyone knew her simply as Aunt Hattie. If you can picture in
your mind the stereotyped ""little old lady,"" then you've got a good idea of what Aunt Hattie
looked like.
Aunt Hattie and her husband had lived in Iowa, and they didn’t have any children. When
her husband died in 1940, she was at a complete loss over what to do. What did life hold for
her now? About that time her church held a missions conference, and one of the visiting
missionaries came to her home for dinner. He suggested that she consider joining a little
missions work way up in northern Minnesota. It was called Oak Hills Fellowship. So Aunt
Hattie followed his suggestion. She moved up here to Bemidji and started doing the laundry for
the staff of Oak Hills Fellowship. It wasn’t a glamorous job, but it had to be done. That was her
contribution to the kingdom. She did laundry. But she did more than that. Aunt Hattie had
never learned how to drive so she gave her husband’s car away to a missionary who needed
transportation. When her house in Iowa sold, instead of putting the money in a bank she gave it
all to the Sudan Interior Mission. They used it to build a mission station in Nigeria.
1 That was
Aunt Hattie.
What a story! It makes you think, doesn’t it?
Paul has another story to tell the Corinthians. The example of the Macedonians
probably makes the believers in Jesus down in Corinth do some thinking, but Paul tells them a
very short story that is even more powerful.
8
I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by
comparing it with the earnestness of others.
9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through
his poverty might become rich. (2 Cor. 8:8-9)
There is the good news of Jesus Christ in a nutshell. The New Testament teaches us
that Christ existed before the beginning of time. He is the Son of God who enjoyed the holy and
loving presence of his Father before time began, but he was willing to leave the glory of heaven
to come to this earth and become a human being. Think back to Christmas and the humble
circumstances of Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem. And what was Bethlehem? Today, of course,
Bethlehem is a world famous city, but back then it was just a little unimportant village in a distant
and disliked part of the vast Roman Empire. The Son of God leaves heaven for Bethlehem. Of
course, there’s more to the story, isn’t there? Jesus dies a miserable and shameful death to
pay the penalty for our sins. He’s nailed to a wooden cross and then left there until he dies from
the sheer exhaustion and excruciating pain of crucifixion.
You and I know that story, but we probably know it too well. It doesn’t have the impact
on us that it probably should. Think of what Paul writes in verse 9 in a little different way. Paul
describes Jesus in terms of money and possessions. He is rich, but he becomes poor.
I’d like you to think about something that you really like. Can you think of some physical
item that you own and that you really enjoy owning? If you lost it or if somebody stole it, you
would be mad and really miss it. Each of us value different things, but we can all think of
something that we consider valuable. Picture something that you cherish. The first things that
come to my mind are some of my books. Maybe you think of some piece of jewelry or some
gun that has been handed down in your family generation after generation. Or maybe it is your
favorite power tool—that one that is so handy and that you really like using. How about a photo
album with pictures of your grandparents or your grandchildren? Maybe it is a musical
instrument that you love to play. Some of us probably think of our cars. You put in a lot of time and effort in restoring that car, or you carefully saved your money so that you could buy that car
that you always dreamed of owning. Maybe it is that big flat screen TV that you just purchased
so that you could watch the Superbowl this afternoon. Some of us who are younger think of our
phones. That’s what connects us to our friends and to the whole world.
Have you got something in mind? Now I want you to picture taking that valuable
possession of yours and giving it away. It’s not that somebody steals it or that it is burned up in
a fire. No, you choose to give it away and do without it. That would be hard, wouldn’t it? And
you are not giving it away to a family member or a close friend. Oh no. You are giving it away
to a complete stranger. That makes it that much harder, doesn’t it? Here’s one more thing.
That stranger is not someone that you are particularly attracted to. In fact, you find that person
kind of repulsive. He is dirty and smells. You can tell when you give your cherished possession
to her that she has no understanding of what a huge sacrifice you have made in giving it to her.
You are giving your most valuable possession to someone who obviously does not deserve
your generosity!
That’s what is being described in verse 9. “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor.” Jesus willingly chose to
give up his divine majesty and glory and honor for people who did not deserve so much as mere
fraction his generosity. You and I are those people. We did not value God the way we should
have. Instead we ignored him and treated him as someone not worthy of our attention. But
Jesus chose to come and give us himself for us.
And we are told in verse 9 that you and I “through his poverty . . . become rich.” We
don’t deserve what Jesus gives us. Before we have trusted in Jesus as our Lord, we don’t
appreciate what his death on the cross cost him. But after we have turned to him in faith and
entrusted our existence to him, then we understand how truly rich he has made us. Now we
have forgiveness. Now we have a hope that transcends even death. Now we have the
assurance that he is with us and will never leave us. Through his poverty we have become rich.
That is our motivation for giving. Jesus is our motivation for living!
Let’s come to the Lord’s Table. Let’s give thanks for the one who was rich yet for our
sake became poor.
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",2/2/2014,
"I enjoy history—particularly church history. One of the lessons that becomes obvious as you
read church history is that there is nothing new under the sun. The struggles we go through today
are not new. Believers in Christ for the last two thousand years have wrestled with most of the same
questions and issues that you and I face today.
This morning we are going to investigate one of those long-term issues. We can word the
question in a variety of ways. How do we understand God’s holiness and God’s love? How do we
put together in our minds the fact that God is both holy and loving? And how do those two truths
about God affect the way that we live in this world? When it comes to being a disciple of Jesus, is
holiness or love more important? That’s one way of stating the issue.
Or we could put it this way: How do we resolve the tension that exists between legalism and
license? The New Testament teaches us that as believers in Christ we have been freed from the
law, but does that mean that we have the liberty to live any way we want? Does the forgiveness of
sin mean that God does not care about whether we obey him or not?
Here’s another way to approach our subject this morning: How can we both holy and
human? I put it that way because I know that some of us were raised in homes or in churches
where we got the idea that it is sin to have fun. It’s not that anybody actually taught us that. In fact,
our parents and our church leaders would vehemently deny that they ever said such a thing.
Nevertheless, that’s the impression that we were left with. “Be careful about having too much fun
because it is bound to lead you into sin!”
Do you understand what we are going to think about this morning? How do we practice both
God’s holiness and God’s love? How do we avoid the twin problems of legalism and license? How
can we be holy and human?
This is not a new issue. Back in the first century the apostle Paul writes to the Corinthians
about it in both his first and his second letter to them. In the Greek city of Corinth the Christians
were faced with a serious problem: Should they or should they not eat meat that was sacrificed to
idols?
Is there anybody here who’s been asking that question this week? This subject seems so far
removed from the questions that we ask. But Paul’s answer to that question can teach us some
important lessons.
Let’s understand the situation. In ancient Corinth there were lots of gods and goddesses
who were worshiped. Almost all the meat that you bought at the local grocery store came from
sacrificial animals. An animal would be killed in a religious ceremony in the temple of some idol, and
then the meat would be brought to the marketplace and put up for sale. Most all the meat available
for purchase had previously been sacrificed to an idol. So what were the Christians supposed to
do? If they ate the meat, would they be participating in an act of idol worship? Or were they free to
eat the meat because through Jesus Christ they had come to know the one and only true God?
Do you understand the problem? It seems far removed from our world, but it was a
significant question in first century Corinth. What were the Christians in Corinth supposed to do?
Should they absolutely refuse to eat meat sacrificed to idols, or could they go about their daily lives
and eat the same food that their neighbors ate? Could they be both devoted to Christ and a normal
citizen of Corinth? How could they be both holy and human?
Be Careful But Not Picky
Look at what Paul says. Let’s start by reading what he says in his first letter to the
Corinthians.
9
I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people— 10
not at
all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, or the greedy and swindlers, or
idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world. (1 Cor. 5:9-10)
Paul does not teach that we should lock ourselves away in monasteries so that we never have any
kind of social interaction with non-Christians. That is not what Paul teaches about the Christian life.
Later in the letter Paul goes on and explains how that general teaching works itself out when
it comes to eating meat sacrificed to idols.
25 Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,
26
for,
“The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it.”
27
If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat whatever is put
before you without raising questions of conscience.
28 But if someone says to you, “This has
been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, both for the sake of the one who told you and for
the sake of conscience. (1 Cor. 10:25-28)
Do you see what Paul is saying? He is, in effect, telling the believers in Corinth how they can
be both human and holy. They can be like their neighbors and go to the marketplace and buy the
meat being sold there. But if they are at someone’s house and that person makes a deliberate point
of saying that the meat was killed as a sacrifice to an idol, then they should not eat it.
Here’s how I would summarize what Paul is saying to the Corinthians: Be careful but not
picky. He is not telling them to ignore the question of meat sacrificed to idols. In ancient Corinth it is
an issue that needs to be addressed. But Paul doesn’t want the Christians to become obsessed
with it either. The Corinthians don’t need to ask a bundle of questions every time they walk into a
fast-food restaurant for a hamburger! Be careful but not picky.
That background helps us understand what Paul teaches in 2 Corinthians 6:14. When Paul
says “Do not be yoked together with unbelievers,” he is using a picture from farming. If you are
going to plow a field, don’t yoke together an ox and a donkey to pull the plough. Don’t harness
together two animals of unequal strength because one will overpower the other. Paul applies that
idea to Christians and non-Christians. It’s not that we should avoid non-Christians, but we should be
careful that we don’t get yoked or harnessed or obligated to a non-Christian. Why? Because you
over time you may very well get overpowered and pulled off in the wrong direction. Be careful but
don’t be picky.
Do you have some friends who are not believers in Christ? Good! It’s good to be on an
athletic team at school with non-Christians. It’s fine to get together with your friends to watch the
Superbowl. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a good laugh with a coworker of yours who has
not trusted in Christ. God does not ask us to be afraid to be with people who do not share our love
for Christ.
But be careful. All of us are capable of getting in over our heads and being overpowered.
Let’s not fool ourselves by thinking otherwise. Over time friendships can pull us away from God.
Don’t delude yourself into thinking that such a thing could never happen to you. Yes, it can! None
of us are immune to social pressure. We can all be tempted and pulled away in the wrong direction.
You can be both human and holy. Don’t be picky, but do be careful.
Remember Christ and the Difference He Makes
Paul does not stop with that instruction. He goes on and encourages us to remember Christ
and the difference that he makes in our lives. Paul makes that point by asking five rhetorical
questions.
For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light
have with darkness?
15 What harmony is there between Christ and Belial?
1 Or what does a
believer have in common with an unbeliever?
16 What agreement is there between the temple
of God and idols? (2 Cor. 6:14b-16a)
Paul asks those rhetorical questions in order to highlight the difference that Christ has made
in our lives. Yes, we are still human. In many ways we are like everybody else in the world. God
has created us with a need to eat and sleep. He has fashioned us as creatures who have the
capacity to enjoy pleasure and experience happiness. We need social interaction with other people,
and we do find satisfaction in our relationships with others. All that’s true. We are human. But as Christians we also know that God has changed us. He has done something inside of
us. When you and I trust in Jesus Christ as our Lord, there is a change that takes place, isn’t there?
Our sins are forgiven, and we enter into what we so often call “a personal relationship with God.”
Through Christ we have come to know God, and God plants new desires within us. We are given a
new and different orientation to life.
God through Paul tells us here in 2 Corinthians that we need to be sure that we don’t forget
the difference that Christ makes. As those who have Jesus as their Lord and Master, we will never
fit into the world the way that we once did. We are still human, and we can and should enjoy God’s
creation. But we are also different. Don’t be surprised at that. Don’t be ashamed of it either.
I mentioned at the beginning of this sermon that I enjoy history. One of the things that I have
learned about the history of the church is that there have been huge swings in the pendulum.
Sometimes Christians have separated themselves too much from the world. The church has swung
to a monastic view of life where Christians have no impact or even interest in what is happening
around them. But at other times it has swung in the opposite direction and has become so
concerned about speaking to the culture it lives in that it has lost its distinctive nature. That makes
me wonder which direction the pendulum is swinging today.
Each one of us might answer that question a little differently depending upon our past
experiences and our present situation in life. My impression is that the pendulum here in the United
States is swinging strongly in the direction of conformity to the world. I listen to what Christians are
saying today. I hear a lot more people talking about God’s grace than God’s holiness. We are on
guard against anything that smacks of legalism, but we tend to minimize the seriousness of sin. We
say that we want to be build bridges to the non-believing world. That’s good. But I wonder if the
world is slowly building its value system in our souls.
We need to remember that while we are human, we are also called to be holy. That means
that we will never fit in entirely. Let’s not be ashamed of that. Let’s embrace it and enjoy it. It’s
good and healthy to be the holy people God wants us to be. Let’s remember the difference that
Jesus makes.
Listen to What God Says
Look again at what Paul writes to the Corinthians. Paul wants to reinforce this message
about the difference that Christ makes in the way that we live. In order to accomplish that goal, what
does he do? He quotes several passages from the Old Testament about how the Israelites were
supposed to be different from the nations that surrounded them.
For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said:
“I will live with them
and walk among them,
and I will be their God,
and they will be my people.”
17 Therefore,
“Come out from them
and be separate,
says the Lord.
Touch no unclean thing,
and I will receive you.”
18 And,
“I will be a Father to you,
and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.” (2 Cor.
6:16b-18)
Just as the Corinthians in the first century needed to be reminded of what God said in the
Old Testament, you and I today need to listen to what God says in his Word. To put it simply: If you
and I want to be holy, we need to read the Bible.
During the last couple of weeks I’ve been wondering about the subject of sexual immorality.
Today it seems to be taken so lightly. You move in with your boyfriend or your girlfriend. That’s no
big deal. You enter into a sexual relationship with someone of the same gender, and that’s
applauded in the media. You leave your husband or wife for another person. That’s not so good,
but if that’s what it takes to make you happy, then it’s understandable.
I think about those messages that we get day after day in our society. I don’t have any
doubts that they are wrong. God in his Word says that sexual immorality is wrong. But then I start
to wonder. Maybe it’s wrong, but maybe we Christians have made too much of it. Could it be that
we have made sexual immorality into something worse than it really is? Is that a possibility? Sex is
just a part of being human, isn’t it? Could it be that we are being too picky when it comes to sexual
immorality?
This week I’ve been reading the Book of Revelation, and I noticed how often that book of the
Bible mentions sexual immorality (Rev. 2:14, 20; 9:21; 21:8; 22:15). Revelation never treats sexual
immorality as a minor problem. Don’t just take my word for it. Read Revelation for yourself. The
way that Revelation deals with sexual sin is the same way that the entire Bible treats it. For
example, Paul writes in 1 Corinthians 6:18, “Flee from sexual immorality.” I should perhaps mention
that as a pastor I have also seen too many people get hurt because of the way that they have
misused God’s good gift of sex.
That experience of mine just this week was a reminder to me of how we need to follow Paul’s
example and listen to what God says in his Word. If you and I want to be holy, we need to read the
Bible and learn what God says is pleasing to him and good for us.
Get to Work!
Paul has one more thing to teach us on this subject of being holy and human. He brings his
discussion of this topic to a close in the first verse of chapter 7.
1 Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from
everything that contaminates body and spirit, perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.
(2 Cor. 7:1)
When Paul mentions “promises” in that verse, he’s referring to what he just quoted in the previous
verse. God says, “I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters.”
When you make that decision to entrust your life to Jesus Christ, God becomes your Father.
He is not some distant deity. He’s your Father, and he cares about everything that you experience.
Isn’t that good? If God is that good to us, why wouldn’t we want to become the people that he wants
us to be?
Therefore, “let us purify ourselves.” In other words, let’s get to work at becoming holy. Paul
says that we should “purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit.” That
means that we should be holy both externally and internally. We should do what God wants us to
do. We practice justice meaning that we pay people the money that we owe them. We practice
mercy meaning that we help people when they are in trouble. We pray for people that we know are
facing serious problems.
We also work at becoming holy internally. What do you spend your time thinking about?
What kinds of things do you feed your mind on? What TV shows and movies do you watch? What
kind of music do you listen to? Please don’t pretend that those things don’t have an impact on you.
They do! What kind of websites do you visit? Do any of us husbands or wives here today need to
go to our spouses and confess that we’ve been wasting our time on worthless internet sites?
Let’s get to work! “Let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit,
perfecting holiness out of reverence for God.”
Let’s become the people that God wants us to be. We are God’s creatures. So let’s enjoy
the physical life that he has given to us. Through faith in Jesus Christ we are also God’s children.
Let’s enjoy the spiritual life that he gives us. Let’s be both human and holy!

"What counts? That the question that I want us to ask this morning. What counts? What
makes life worthwhile—not just in your own opinion or in someone else’s but in the sight of God?
What does God say truly counts in the way that you and I live?
This morning we are returning to our study of the New Testament book that we call 2
Corinthians. Over the Christmas season we took a break to concentrate on Jesus himself, but today
I want us to resume our study of this portion of God’s Word. Do you remember what 2 Corinthians is
all about?
This letter written by the apostle Paul by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit is an intensely
personal letter. Paul reveals a lot about himself. There is a little phrase that he uses that
summarizes the situation that he is facing. Do you remember it? We find it in chapter 7 verse 5,
and it summarizes everything that Paul has been writing about in the previous chapters. “Conflicts
on the outside, fears within.” Do you remember that phrase?
“Conflicts on the outside”—a riot breaks out in the city of Ephesus, and Paul is said to be the
cause of it. People are upset at the impact that his ministry has made upon the city. Some of the
people want to kill him. So he flees! “Conflicts on the outside, fears within”—Paul is also deeply
concerned about what is going on among the Christians in the city of Corinth. Some people in the
Corinthian church have characterized Paul’s ministry as frankly unimpressive, and they have also
accused him of being unreliable and not worthy of their trust. His reputation is being questioned,
and his ministry is being undermined.
So Paul writes this letter to the Corinthians. He appeals to the Corinthians not to think less of
him but to return the love that he has shown to them.
11 We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, and opened wide our hearts to you.
12
We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us.
13 As a
fair exchange—I speak as to my children—open wide your hearts also. (2 Cor. 6:11-13)
There is Paul’s appeal. “Come back to me,” he says. “Why have you turned away from me?” This
is not just an emotional appeal for loyalty. In verses 3 through 11, Paul explains why they should
continue to value his input into their lives and his direction of their church’s ministry. Here is Paul’s
explanation of what truly counts.
What counts when it comes to evaluating a Christian ministry? What counts when it comes to
evaluating our own lives and our own walk with God. What counts in the sight of God?
Endurance
Listen carefully to what Paul writes. If you were trying to establish your credentials and
restore your reputation in someone else’s sight, is this what you would stress?
3 We put no stumbling block in anyone’s path, so that our ministry will not be
discredited.
4 Rather, as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: in great
endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses;
5
in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in
hard work, sleepless nights and hunger; . . . (2 Cor. 6:3-5)
Do those words strike you as surprising? Here is a guy who by his own admission is constantly in
trouble! And he seems in some strange way to be proud of it!
When I read Paul’s words here, I cannot help but think of what a huge and startling contrast
Paul’s credentials are to what is sometimes called the Prosperity Gospel. It’s actually broader than
that. We could call it Celebrity Christianity or the American Dream in religious clothing. Some
ministries seem to aim at always making a big splash. Everything is big. There is a big church with
a big-name pastor who gets a big salary. He lives in a big house because he prays big prayers
accompanied by big faith!
And all Paul talks about is his suffering. “We commend ourselves in every way: in great
endurance; in troubles, hardships and distresses; in beatings, imprisonments and riots; in hard work,
sleepless nights and hunger.” Paul is not interested in making a big splash. If he wanted to, Paul
could write to the Corinthians about his first missionary journey and how many churches he
established in Asia Minor. Paul could remind the Corinthians of that, but he doesn’t. Paul could go on
and tell the Corinthians about how he was the first one who brought the good news of Jesus Christ to
the cities of Greece—including Corinth, but he doesn’t. Paul is not interested in the big splash. He is
far more concerned about the long haul. Endurance is what really counts. Faithfulness to God over
time is far more important than impressive but short-term successes.
I think of Pastor Rick Warren out at Saddleback Church in California. He’s a big name in
Christian circles: a big church—20,000 people every Sunday; a best-selling book, The Purpose
Driven Life; and an invitation to pray at the inauguration of the President. That is pretty impressive!
But do you want to know what impresses me the most about Rick Warren? It’s what he and his wife,
Kay, did this year after their twenty-seven-year-old son took his own life. They openly talked about
their son’s faith in Christ and his struggle with mental illness. They acknowledged that Christians
can struggle with lifelong depression. Rick and Kay Warren acknowledged what they called
“catastrophic grief.” Kay said:
“I have to tell you that I fully expect for the rest of my life, as long as I live, there will be tears
in my eyes. And I won't ultimately be comforted until God Himself wipes them from my face. .
. . Every morning when I wake up and every night when I put my head on the pillow, the
reality occurs again. He's not here and he's not coming back.""
She was not afraid to admit the “catastrophic grief” she felt. But then she went on and talked about
her faith:
“But I know that Matthew is OK. He's truly OK. He is not asleep; he has not joined the
cosmos; . . . He went straight into the arms of his Savior Jesus Christ when his body hit the
ground on earth; he was in the presence of God. And in the perfection of heaven, his broken
mind was healed. And I'm so grateful for that. And I look forward—I wait for the day when I'll
finally see that for myself.""
1
That is truly impressive. It’s in our trials and not so much in our successes where we
demonstrate the reality of our faith in Christ. Isn’t that true?
I think of what some of you have gone through. I’ve seen your faith as you have struggled
with death and disappointment. Some of you have found yourselves facing sudden and unexpected
crises, and some of you have struggled with chronic problems. It’s your endurance in those
situations that has proven the genuineness of your faith in Jesus Christ.
No one here knows what the future holds for us. What’s going to happen this year? This
month? This week? Let’s make it our goal that whatever happens, we will still trust God and live for
him. It is our endurance that will count.
Character
Starting in verse 6 Paul mentions something else that counts in the sight of God: character . . . we commend ourselves . . .
6
in purity, understanding, patience and kindness; in the
Holy Spirit and in sincere love;
7
in truthful speech and in the power of God; . . . (2Cor. 6:6-
7a)
It’s interesting to note how he works into that list of virtues both “the Holy Spirit” and “the power of
God.” Paul knows that we cannot be the people that God wants us to be without God’s work in our
lives. We need God’s Holy Spirit to make us into the people that he wants us to be.
Then Paul continues by saying that he is going to live that way whatever the response that
he receives from other people:
7
. . . with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left [no matter which side he
is attacked from];
8
through glory and dishonor, bad report and good report; genuine, yet
regarded as impostors;
9
known, yet regarded as unknown; . . . (2 Cor. 6:7b-9a)
Paul is not done. He is going to live for God whatever the response and whatever the
circumstances.
9
. . . dying, and yet we live on; beaten, and yet not killed;
10
sorrowful, yet always rejoicing;
poor, yet making many rich; having nothing, and yet possessing everything. (2 Cor. 6:9b-10)
Character counts whatever the response and whatever the circumstances. Character is
what counts in the sight of God.
I think of Billy Graham. I realize that many of us who are younger don’t really know much
about Billy Graham. After all, at ninety-five years old, he is slowing down a little. Some of us don’t
know Billy Graham. Yet for many of us Billy Graham has been the most visible figure of Biblebelieving
Christianity in our lifetime.
Billy Graham is first an example of endurance. In the 1940s there were two young and
promising evangelists working with Youth for Christ. One was Billy Graham; the other was Chuck
Templeton. At that time most observers thought that Templeton was by far the more impressive and
effective evangelist. But Chuck Templeton started to have doubts about his faith, and he challenged
Billy Graham with the questions that he was asking. Those questions bothered Billy Graham too.
He struggled with them. He eventually had to admit that he couldn’t answer all of his friends’
questions, but then he decided that he was going to trust God even though he did not understand
everything about God. He was going to continue to trust God and God’s Word. Chuck Templeton
eventually left the ministry. He abandoned the faith altogether. But Billy Graham persevered
through his doubts and proved to be an effective servant of God.
2 Endurance counts!
Think about Billy Graham’s character. I do not want to put him on a pedestal, but Billy
Graham is also an example for us about how character counts. It is not that he did not make
mistakes. He’s human, and like all of us he made his mistakes as he grew and developed. As a
young preacher, Billy Graham was known as the Preaching Windmill. He used such wild and
exuberant gestures when he preached that he looked like a windmill in the pulpit. And his delivery
was lightning fast. When the opportunity came for him to preach his first sermon, he had to decide
between the four sermons that he had prepared. Each one of them, he figured, would last about a
half-hour in length, and that was about the time that he had been given to preach. So he picked one
of his sermons to preach. But when he stood behind the pulpit for that first sermon, he was so
excited and so nervous that he finished his sermon and realized that he still had time left over. So
he preached his second sermon. He still had time left over. He preached his third sermon and then
his fourth. He preached all four of his sermons in less than eight minutes! It was a disaster.
Billy Graham made more serious mistakes than that. He thought that he could reach more
people with the message of Jesus Christ if people saw him as a friend of prominent people—particularly Presidents. After his rise to fame, he tried to cultivate a relationship with President
Truman, but Truman came to the conclusion that Billy Graham was nothing but a publicity-grabbing
religious huckster. There was probably a little bit of truth to that. Years later he thought that he was
a friend of President Nixon, but when the Watergate scandal broke open, he had to admit that he
had been duped by Nixon. He said that he had finally learned never to get that close to a President
again.
4
No, Billy Graham is not perfect. There’s no need to pretend that he is. But—and this is the
important point—throughout his ministry he has kept working at becoming a better ambassador for
Jesus Christ. When Billy Graham left Youth for Christ and started holding his own evangelistic
meetings, he adopted what became known in his organization as the Modesto Manifesto. In
Modesto, California, his team decided on a strict policy on how they would handle money. They
would not emotionally manipulate the people at the rallies so that they could get a bigger offering,
and they would turn the money over to the sponsoring committee so that no one could accuse them
of misusing funds.
5
They also adopted another policy that was novel at the time. Evangelists would often
criticize local pastors in order to attract attention and make it look like God was going to do
something really significant now that they had rolled into town. I remember that once happening
here in Bemidji. The evangelist looks good while he is in town, but when he leaves the local pastors
have to try somehow to regain the confidence of their congregations. Billy Graham refused to follow
that common practice.
6
I want to mention one other noteworthy thing about Billy Graham. In the 1960s racial tension
was at a high in our country, and Billy Graham had to face it. He wanted to talk to people about
entrusting their lives to Jesus Christ and receiving new life through him. He didn’t want to get bogged
down in political issues, but he couldn’t remain quiet about such a pressing national issue. In March
of 1953, which was a year before the Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools were
unconstitutional, Billy Graham held a crusade in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The sponsoring
committee informed him that they were going to follow the usual practice of segregated seating. That
was not anything unusual. It was the common practice of the time. One color would sit in one
section, and one color would sit in another. Graham said that that he would not go along with that.
When the sponsoring committee hesitated and balked, he personally walked through the seats
removing the ropes that marked off the separate sections.
Four years later he held a crusade in New York City, and he invited Martin Luther King to
participate. Today that doesn’t sound like a radical step, but in the 1950s that brought all kinds of
criticism to Billy Graham. He was accused of abandoning evangelism and jumping into politics.
One prominent leader said that it proved that Billy Graham was a Communist. But Billy Graham did
not apologize or back down. Character! It is not always easy to know what is the right thing to do in every situation. We
all struggle with that, and we will all make mistakes. When we make mistakes, we need to confess
them and trust in the forgiveness that God so generously gives us through Jesus. But then we need
to decide again to work at doing what is right no matter what the circumstances are and no matter
what response we get from other people.
Endurance and character count! They always have. They always will. They are what God is
looking for in you and me.

",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",1/12/2014,
"
In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken
of the entire Roman world.
2
(This was the first census that took place while Quirinius
was governor of Syria.)
3 And everyone went to their own town to register.
4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to
Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David.
5 He
went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was
expecting a child.
6 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born,
7
and
she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a
manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over
their flocks at night.
9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord
shone around them, and they were terrified.
10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be
afraid. I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.
11 Today in the
town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.
12 This will be a sign
to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”
13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel,
praising God and saying,
14
“Glory to God in the highest,
and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”
15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to
one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the
Lord has told us about.”
16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying
in the manger.
17 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had
been told them about this child,
18
and all who heard it were amazed at what the
shepherds said to them.
19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in
her heart.
20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they
had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told. (Luke 2:1-20)
How many of you have ever heard that story before? That’s a silly question, isn’t it?
That’s the Christmas story! It is the Christmas story! Isn’t that the way that we usually refer to
it?
I’ve always wondered why we call that passage in Luke the Christmas story. We’re also
told about Jesus’ birth in the Gospel of Matthew, but I’ve never heard anybody refer to
Matthew’s account as the Christmas story. No, it is Luke’s version that always gets that honor.
Whatever we call it, we are all familiar with it, aren’t we? We hear it read every
Christmas. It never fails. In churches in December we always hear the account of Jesus’ birth
as it is found in the Gospel according to Luke.
So let’s see how well we know the Christmas story. Please close your Bibles. I’d like to
give you a little quiz on Luke 2:1-20. I am sure that you will all pass this test in flying colors!
Question #1: What was the event that made Joseph and Mary travel to Bethlehem? If
you said, “A census,” you are right. The Roman Emperor had ordered a census to be taken, so
everyone had to go back to their ancestral home to be registered in the census.
Question #2: Who was the Roman Emperor who issued the decree for that census? It
was Caesar Augustus.
Question #3: Who was the governor of Syria when that census was taken? That’s a
little harder, isn’t it? His name was Quirinius. I’ve always felt bad for Quirinius. There he is in
the Christmas story. We read about him every year. Almost none of us remember him. Poor
Quirinius! It’s actually worse than that! Our hymnal neatly edits Quirinius out of its printing of
“The Christmas Story”! How would you like to be part of the Christmas story and then be
deleted?
Question #4: Does Luke tell us that the innkeeper was kind or mean? The answer is
neither. Luke never even mentions the innkeeper. In fact,—oh, I hate to say this because at
Christmas it sounds like heresy—but Luke probably does not even mention the inn. For almost
one hundred years New Testament scholars have recognized that the word that has traditionally
been translated as “inn” is better understood as “guest room.” It was a guest room in a private
home that had no room.
Joseph and Mary had arrived in Bethlehem and walked to one of their relatives’ houses
expecting to stay there while the census was being taken. But when they arrived, the guest
room was already occupied by another family member. Remember that Bethlehem was a small
village, and lots of people had come to Bethlehem because of the census. So instead of staying
in the guest room, Joseph and Mary had to stay in the common living quarters of the small
house where the rest of the family was staying and where the animals were brought at night for
safe keeping. When the baby was born, there was no place to put him except in the feeding
trough that the animals used.
1
Question #5: What did the angels sing to the shepherds? Do you remember what the
shepherds heard the angels sing? If you say, “Glory to God in the highest,” you are wrong.
Luke never says that the angels sang to the shepherds. He says that the angels were “praising
God and saying.” But we always picture them singing, don’t we?
How did you do on the quiz? I want you to understand that I did not give you that quiz
simply to play tricks on you! Luke 2:1-20 provides us with a good example of how we can be
familiar with something—very familiar with something!—but still not know it as well as we think
we do. Familiarity is not the same thing as knowing.
That is true not just with the Christmas story but with Jesus Christ himself. I daresay
that most of us are familiar with Jesus. Jesus is still a prominent figure in our culture. He is not
only talked about in churches; he is frequently referred to in some way or other in our culture at
large. It is not uncommon to hear his name mentioned. It is not strange to hear someone cite
his life as an example of how we should be living. Most of us are very familiar with Jesus. But familiarity is not the same thing as knowing. To be familiar with Jesus—in other
words, to have some knowledge about his birth and death and resurrection—is good. Of
course, it is good. But having that knowledge about him is not the same as knowing him.
Isn’t that the way that it always works with people? You can learn facts about a person’s
life. That is always interesting. But it is an entirely different thing to sit down and to talk with
that person and to learn what makes that person tick. It is one thing to know about a person. It
is an entirely different thing to know that person. That’s the way it is with people—including
Jesus!
I think of my own experience. I was brought up going to church. We were there every
Sunday. I remember going to Sunday School and learning about Jesus. I remember as a child
hearing the Christmas story and participating in Christmas programs. But when I was 16 years
old, somebody asked me if I had ever taken the Bible seriously. For the first time I really started
reading the Bible and looking into what it says about Jesus. I remember that it was two weeks
later that I bowed by head and prayed. I told God that I believed that he raised Jesus from the
dead and that Jesus is Lord (Rom. 10:8-9). I didn’t really understand everything that simple
prayer meant, but I knew that I wanted to pray that prayer.
That’s when I moved from familiarity to knowing. Something had happened. Some One
had entered into my life. I didn’t see him. I didn’t hear his audible voice. But I knew that my life
had changed. Jesus had somehow entered into my life.
That was quite a few years ago. I have still not ever had a vision of Jesus. I don’t think
that I have ever heard the audible voice of God. There have been times when I have felt very
close to God, but there have also been times when God seemed so distant. There have been
times when my faith has felt strong and vibrant. There have also been times when I have been
filled with questions and doubts. Yet through it all Jesus Christ has been there for me. He has
been there with me even when I haven’t sensed his presence. I can tell you that I am as
grateful now as I was when I was 16 that Jesus is not someone that I just know about. He is
Someone that I know.
My hope for you is that this Christmas you will move beyond the Christmas story. I hope
that you will move beyond mere familiarity with Jesus. My prayer for you is that you will know
Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior. Could this be the day when you bow your head and say,
“Jesus, I need you in my life. I need to be forgiven of all the things that I’ve done wrong, and I
want you to be present in everything that I do. So right now, Jesus, I am handing my life over to
you. I believe that you died on the cross for my sins, and I want you to be the Master of
everything that I do from now on.”
The good news of Jesus Christ is that when we humble ourselves before him and admit
our need of him, he does enter into our lives. He promises to stick with us through all the things
that we encounter in this life. His faithfulness even goes beyond this life. Jesus gives us
eternal life with God in heaven.
This Christmas please move beyond familiarity with Jesus to knowing him as your Lord
and your Savior.",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",12/22/2013,
"Several years ago I came across a picture of Jesus. Before I
show it to you, I need to explain how this picture came about.
Scientists, who practice what is called forensic anthropology, use
various kinds of cultural and archaeological evidence to create an
image that displays the typical features of people who lived long ago
in some specific culture. Forensic anthropology is not an exact
science, but it can give us a pretty good idea of what a typical thirty
year-old male living around Jerusalem in the first century would have
probably looked like. Here is what they came up with:
As you look at that picture and take it in, I’ll let you in on some
additional information. The average male in first century Judea was
about 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighed around 110 pounds. His facial
features would have borne at least some general resemblance to this picture.
1
So what do you think? For one thing, it is obvious that Jesus is not Scandinavian. Let’s
admit that all those pictures of Jesus that you and I have seen do make an impact on us, and
we start to assume unconsciously that Jesus had white skin, long light brown hair, and blue
eyes. This picture brings us much closer to the truth. I remember the first time I ever showed
this picture to a group of people. Afterwards one person came up to me and said, “Pastor Fred,
he looks like a terrorist!”
Here’s another thing about this picture: Jesus doesn’t look very impressive, does he?
Maybe in another culture this face would be more impressive, but I doubt it. This man looks
normal or ordinary. From all outward appearances he is just another man. And that’s the way it
should be. The New Testament never describes Jesus’ physical appearance. There is no
indication in the Bible that Jesus stood out like some ancient celebrity or movie star. He’s not a
religious looking Brad Pitt. This picture, I think, can teach us a valuable lesson. It reminds us
that Jesus was truly human. He was a man. That’s easy to forget. We need to remember that
Jesus is truly human.

This morning we are continuing an investigation that we started a couple of weeks ago.
We have been thinking about who Jesus is. Is Jesus just a historical figure from the past? Is he
just a famous ethical teacher? Or is he something more? Who is Jesus? I warned you two
weeks ago when we started this study that my goal for Christmas was to stretch you. Today I
want to stretch you to the limit!
Here’s why. If Jesus is just a famous Jewish rabbi, then we know what to do with him.
We respect him and honor him as someone who made an important contribution to human
history. But what if Jesus is more than just a great teacher? What if he is in a category all by
himself? What are we going to do with him then? How are you going to respond to him? Will
you just admire him from a distance or will you admit to him that you in some way need him?
Will you submit yourself to him and pledge to him your loyalty?
Two questions need to be answered. Who is Jesus? What are you going to do with
him? Two weeks ago we did a simple Bible study in the Gospel of John, and we saw how
John makes it clear that Jesus is human. John 4:6 describes how Jesus got tired when he was
on a journey and had to take a break. “Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the
well.” That makes him sound like you and me, doesn’t it? You spend all day Christmas
shopping, and you come home exhausted. Jesus didn’t go Christmas shopping, but there were
times when all he wanted to do was to sit down and get a little rest.
Let’s think about another Bible passage that gives us some insight into the humanness
of Jesus. Luke 2:51-52 says, “Then he went down to Nazareth with [his parents] and was
obedient to them. But his mother treasured all these things in her heart. And Jesus grew in
wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.” Jesus “grew in wisdom.” What does that
mean? Think about it. Luke is telling us that Jesus grew in his mental abilities just like every
other child does. As a boy Jesus needed to learn things. He needed to be educated. Why was
that? Because he was a human being.
There is nothing remarkable about that until we remember what we looked at last week.
The New Testament teaches us that Jesus is truly God. The very first words of John’s Gospel
teach us that. Jesus is referred to as the Word. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God.” The early Christians wrestled with that idea for several
centuries. In what sense can Jesus be called God? We looked at that question last week.
Some Christians proposed that he was divine but that he was somehow a lesser God than the
Father. After years of study and debate, the early church rejected that idea. They stated their
conclusion in a declaration called the Nicene Creed. They said that the only way to do justice to
what the New Testament teaches about Jesus is to declare that he is “true God from true God.”
He is not a lesser God. No, he is fully God.
The Nicene Creed, however, does not settle all the questions. Stop and think about it. If
Jesus is truly God, then how do we understand what the Bible teaches about his humanness?
If Jesus is truly God, then how could he have gotten tired when he was on that journey that
John chapter 4 tells us about? Shouldn’t he have been able to run a marathon without even
breaking into a sweat? Luke tells us that “Jesus grew in wisdom.” Did God grow in wisdom?
Did God get smarter as Jesus got older? Those are just the start of the questions that come to
our minds. If we take the Bible for what it actually says, then how do we begin to put all of this
together in our own minds?
Docetism
3
Some of the early Christians suggested that Jesus only
appeared to be human. He was truly God, but he looked and acted as if
he were a human being. He wasn’t really tired, but he looked like he
was tired. Jesus didn’t really die on the cross; he only appeared to have
died on the cross.
4 That proposal became known as Docetism. That
comes from a Greek word, dokei, which means “it seems.” It seemed
like Jesus was human, but he really wasn’t. We can diagram Docetism
this way:
What do you think of that proposal? Jesus did a good job of looking human, but he
really wasn’t. Docetism denies the reality of Jesus’ human nature. The early Christians pretty
quickly agreed that Docetism did not account for what we read in the New Testament. Matthew,
Mark, Luke, and John all portray Jesus’ death upon the cross as a real death. Jesus wasn’t
pretending. He died! A human life ended at the crucifixion. Docetism is wrong. Eutychianism
Later on a man named Eutychus makes another proposal. He
suggests that Jesus had both a divine nature and a human nature. In
other words, he was truly God and truly human, but the human and
divine natures were mingled. For all practical purposes the human
nature was absorbed into the divine nature. Yes, Jesus was human, but
the divine nature was so much more powerful that it swallowed up Jesus’
human nature to the point where it didn’t really count for much. Here’s a
diagram for Eutychianism:
What do you think of that idea? The early Christians think about that for a while, but
then say, “Sorry, Eutychus, that can’t be the answer.” If Jesus’ divine nature is united to Jesus’
human nature, then what you’ve got is neither God nor a man. Now you’ve got something
entirely different! Imagine putting a human mind into a lion. What would you come up with? It
wouldn’t be a lion any longer because lions don’t have a human mind, but it wouldn’t be a
human because humans don’t have the body of a lion. It would be an entirely new kind of
creature.
5
If you totally unite Jesus’ deity with his humanity, you end up with the same problem.
“Nice try, Eutychus, but you’re wrong.”
Nestorianism
Along comes another man named Nestorius. He says, “I’ve got
it. I’ve got it! Jesus has a divine nature, and he has a human nature.
Sometimes he acts as a human being, but at other times he acts as God.
When he is performing miracles, that is his divine nature in action. But
when he gets tired or has to learn something, it is his human nature that
is being described. Jesus has a divine nature and a human nature, and
you have to be careful to distinguish between the two.” Here’s what
Nestorianism looks like:
What do you think of that idea? The early Christians think about this proposal, but they
conclude that Nestorius isn’t right either. Nestorius makes it appear that there are actually two
different persons living inside of Jesus. Sometimes it is God, and but at other times it is a
human being. Jesus’ divine nature and Jesus’ human nature are entirely separate. The early
Christians say, “That’s not what we read about in the New Testament. Jesus is not two people.
He is only one!”
The Definition of Chalcedon
Finally in the year A.D. 451, a group of Christian leaders get together in a city named
Chalcedon. Today it is a district in the modern city of Istanbul in Turkey. There the Christian
leaders put together a statement. It’s called the Definition of Chalcedon. It still stands as the
best job that anyone has every done in explaining how Jesus can be both God and human.
Here’s what it says:
“. . . we should confess that our Lord Jesus Christ is . . .
truly God and truly man,
. . . made known in two natures
without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.”
Jesus is “truly man”; therefore, Docetism is wrong. His divine and human natures are “without
confusion, without change”; therefore, Eutychus is wrong. His two natures are “without division,
without separation”; therefore, his Nestorius is wrong. We can summarize the Definition of
Chalcedon this way: Jesus is truly God, truly human, and truly one. He is God. He is a man.
But he is only one person. Beyond that our human minds and human language cannot go Conclusion
Are you feeling stretched? I know that I have dumped a truckload of heavy theology on
you this morning! (The truth is that I have simplified the whole thing. It’s actually much more
complex than what I’ve told you!)
You are probably wondering, “Fred, what’s the point? This sounds like one huge
theological word game. Where does all of this take us? What does this tell us about who Jesus
is?” Good question! Let’s step back for a moment and put aside all the terminology. What
does all of this tell us about Jesus?
Two thousand years ago a baby is born in Bethlehem. He grows up in a village called
Nazareth. He works as a carpenter. He gets splinters in his hands, and he probably hits his
fingers with a hammer more than once—just like every other carpenter who has ever built
anything. When he is about thirty years old, he starts preaching. He teaches people how God
wants them to live. He also performs miracles. More than that, though, he says amazing things
about himself.
The people who follow him eventually come to the conclusion that he isn’t just a teacher,
and he is even more than a miracle worker. They conclude that even though he is a man, he is
also God. They don’t jump to that conclusion! They are all Jews. Everything in their Jewish
upbringing tells them that God is transcendent. He rules over the world! No Jewish person of
the first century dares to think that Almighty God would become a part of this world. But those
people who follow Jesus eventually become convinced of that very thing. Even though it goes
against everything that they have been taught, they become convinced that Jesus of Nazareth
is not just an astonishing human being. He is also God.
Some of them write down their observations about Jesus. For the next four hundred
years Christians wrestle with the ideas recorded in those writings. Their goal is not to invent
new theological doctrines. They are just trying to understand what the people who knew Jesus
wrote about him in the New Testament. They eventually come up with statements called the
Nicene Creed and the Definition of Chalcedon. Those statements protect the church against
false ideas about Jesus, and they point us in the right direction in trying to understand Jesus.
But they don’t answer all of our questions. Jesus is someone who is so far beyond our ability to
describe. We can say that he is God and that he is human and that he is just one person, but
beyond that we have to admit that our finite minds and our human language simply are not
adequate to do him justice.
Who is Jesus? He is someone who is so striking. There is something about him that
just calls for your attention. You can’t ignore him. That’s because he is so original. There’s no
one else like him. He is in a class all by himself. And he’s compelling. In one way or another
he leaves his mark on every person he encounters. But Jesus is also curiously baffling. He’s
not a person who is easy to characterize. He’s doesn’t fit into any neat and familiar category.
He’s a human, but he is also God. Even as we say those words, we know that we can’t fully
explain them. But no one has ever found a better way of describing Jesus.
So striking, so original, so compelling, and so baffling. But let’s add one other adjective.
Jesus is also so deserving. That’s what Jesus’ first disciples learned. That incredible individual
named Jesus deserved everything that they could give him. Even if their allegiance to him cost
them their families or their lives, he was worthy of that kind of sacrifice.
And he still is today. Jesus hasn’t changed. He is still so deserving. He deserves your
trust. He deserves your submission. He deserves your sacrifice. He is worthy of your lifelong
loyalty. Will you give him all that he deserves?
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",12/15/2013,
"Centuries ago in the city of Antioch there was a bishop named Meletius. His
preference was to preach safe sermons. He steered clear of controversial subjects. One
Sunday, however, he decided to preach on one of the hot theological issues of the day.
Another preacher, who happened to be in the congregation, became increasingly upset as
he listened to what Meletius was saying. When he could stand it no longer, he rushed up
to the pulpit, grabbed Meletius, and tried to silence him. At one point in the ensuing fight
the other preacher succeeded in getting his hand over Meletius's mouth, but Meletius then
started using hand signals in order to continue his message!
1 Needless to say, nobody
complained that morning that the sermon was boring.
Incidents like that were not all that exceptional way back in the fourth century.
Bishops would show up at official church meetings with crowds of exuberant supporters.
A Roman emperor once sent a popular bishop into exile, and a riot broke out between the
bishop's supporters and the emperor’s troops. It could work the other way too. A mob in
Constantinople once forced an emperor to resign because he had allowed the words of a
favorite song to be changed.
2 Church was an exciting place to be back in the fourth
century!
You and I hear stories like that, and we wonder what happened. What happened
to the simple faith of Jesus’ first disciples? Whatever happened to the idea of humbling
following Jesus and preaching the good news about God’s love? Sometimes you hear
people say that within a few centuries of Jesus’ time the church that bears his name
wandered far away from what he had taught. The leaders of the church became
embroiled in doctrinal controversies, and they invented complicated theological novelties.
Let’s get a few things straight. First, we need to rid ourselves of that sentimental
and romanticized view of Jesus that we often slip into—particularly at Christmas. Think
again about what the New Testament tells us about Jesus. Jesus stirs things up and gets
people’s attention in unexpected ways. No, it’s not that we find him and his disciples in a
flash mob singing “All You Need is Love.” No, that’s not it! Jesus stirs things up by calling
attention to himself. He becomes the center of controversy because he makes such
startling claims about himself. The Pharisees don’t like what he says, and the Sadducees
don’t like him either. Who does this Jesus of Nazareth think that he is? The Roman
governor, Pontius Pilate, doesn’t know quite what to do with him either.
Think of Jesus’ own disciples. They can’t figure him out. They are drawn to him,
but they also question and sometimes disagree with what he does. One disciple denies
him. Another disciple betrays him. Jesus is someone who is so compelling. He can’t be
ignored. In one way or another he leaves his mark on every person he encounters.
There is no doubt about that. But Jesus is also curiously baffling. He’s not a person who
is easy to characterize. He’s doesn’t fit into any neat and familiar category. He’s so
striking and so original. Even the disciples have a hard time figuring him out.
If that is true while Jesus is with his disciples, why should we be surprised that
after his death and resurrection his followers still struggle with how they should describe
him? That’s what the debates are about in the early centuries of the church. Church leaders are not inventing new doctrines because they have nothing better to do with their
time. They are wrestling with the central issue of the Christian faith: Who is Jesus?
Who is Jesus? That’s a question that we still wrestle with today. Who is Jesus?
And what are we personally going to do with him? Will you and I admire from a distance
or will we submit ourselves to him and pledge to him our loyalty? Who is Jesus? What
are you going to do with him? Those were the questions that I raised last week. You’ll
remember that I warned you that I was going to stretch you in these Christmas sermons.
I’m repeating that warning today. I hope you’re ready. We are in for a ride today, and
next week it gets even wilder!
The Gospel of John
Last week we started our inquiry into who Jesus is by doing a simple Bible study in
the Gospel of John. Jesus says all people should honor him even as they honor the
Father. He goes even further and says that if they do not honor him, then they have not
honored God (John 5:23). What an incredible thing to say about yourself! Jesus refers to
himself in terms that make him equal to God! But the Gospel of John also makes Jesus
sound so much like you and me. After walking a long way, Jesus gets tired and thirsty
(John 4:6-7). He needs to rest and have a drink of water. On the one hand, Jesus is
God. On the other hand, he is so obviously human. What do you make of that? Who is
Jesus?
Is the person we know as Jesus truly God? If that is true, then who is the person
that Jesus calls his Father? Is he God too? But wait a minute! Is there more than one
God? And here’s another thing. If Jesus is God, then what kind of God is he? Did his
deity or divine nature in some way change when he became a man? Those are tough
questions. They all arise from trying to figure out what the Bible says about Jesus. Is it
surprising that it took the early Christians several centuries to come up with answers that
they thought were adequate?
Sabellius
Who is Jesus? Shortly after the year 200 there is a man who comes to Rome
whose name is Sabellius. Sabellius says, ""I've got the answer. Here's how it works.
Jesus is God, but he's not really any different from God the Father. There is only one
God, but that one God reveals himself in different ways. Sometimes he reveals himself as
the Father, sometimes as the Son, and sometimes as the Holy Spirit. But there is really
no difference between them. Those are three names for the same Person. That’s who
Jesus is!""
3
What do you think of Sabellius's idea? There's one God who reveals himself in
three different ways. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three names for the same Person.
That sounds kind of attractive, doesn't it? I've heard a lot of Christians today give that
exact explanation. There is one God who reveals himself in three different ways. But
when the early Christians carefully compare that teaching to the Bible, they say, “Sorry,
Sabellius, but your ideas aren’t going to cut it. For one thing, the Bible tells us that Jesus
prays to his Father in the Garden of Gethsemane (Luke 22:44). When Jesus is praying
there, he is genuinely asking for help. He feels desperate. He isn’t just playing a game by
praying to himself! He’s someone praying to someone else asking for help. Therefore,
Jesus and the Father can’t be the same person. Nice try, Sabellius, but you’re wrong!” About a hundred years later in the city of Alexandria in Egypt there is a deacon in
the church named Arius. Arius says that he has Jesus figured out. Jesus is divine, and
he is not the same as the Father. In fact, the Father at some time, Arius says, created the
Son. Therefore, Jesus is divine, but he is slightly less divine than God the Father. God is
the Light, and Jesus is a lesser Light. He is still divine, but he is a lesser God than the
Father.
Now Arius is one smart cookie! Not only does he teach about Jesus, but he also
comes up with a catchy little slogan that summarizes his teaching. “There was when he
was not.” When you compare that slogan to things that we hear today—“There are some
things that money can’t buy. For everything else, there’s Mastercard” or “Every kiss
begins with Kay”—by modern standards Arius’s slogan is not that catchy. But take my
word for it, in the world of theology that is about as catchy a slogan as you'll ever find.
""There was when he was not."" Arius reasons that Christ was the ""only begotten"" Son of
the Father. If he was begotten or born of the Father, then there must have been a time
before he was born. There must have been a time when he was not. That sounds logical,
doesn't it?
What do you think of Arius’s idea? Back in the fourth century Arius has a lot of
supporters. Songs are written based on his ideas about Jesus. A lot of people think that
he has it all figured out, but there is one man who relentlessly opposes Arius's teaching.
You should know this man's name. In two thousand years of church history this man is
one of the most important figures to come along. His name is Athanasius. It takes
decades but finally Athanasius convinces the other Christians that Arius's teaching about
Jesus does not account for all of what the Bible teaches. For example, Paul writes to the
Colossians about Christ, and he says, “God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in
him” (Col. 1:19 emphasis added). Christ is not a lesser God. Jesus is not some secondrate
God who becomes a man. Arius is wrong!
The Nicene Creed
Three hundred bishops of the church get together in a city named Nicaea. Its
ruins are in present-day Turkey. There in Nicaea the leaders of the church hammer out a
statement that has been passed along to us as the Nicene Creed. Here’s what it says
about Jesus. ""We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, eternally
begotten of the Father.” Remember that Arius says that since Jesus was begotten or born
of the Father, there had to be a time when Jesus did not exist. The Nicene Creed says
that Jesus is ""eternally begotten from the Father."" He was born eternally meaning that he
was born before time started. In other words, there never was when he was not. Never!
Jesus is ""God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten not made.”
Take that, Arius! Jesus is “of one Being with the Father."" He's not a creature; he's not a
lesser light or a lesser God; nor is he a God of a different being or nature than the Father.
No, Christ is as fully God as the Father is.
The Nicene Creed announces and asserts the deity of Jesus Christ. This creed is
not inspired of God. We shouldn’t rank as important as the Bible. But we should
recognize for what it is. It’s the end result of centuries of Bible study. Who is Jesus?
How can we begin to understand him and adequately describe him? All the major
branches of the Christian church—Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant—
endorse this statement. The Nicene Creed isn’t perfect, but it has stood for the last
seventeen centuries as the best statement that anybody has ever come up with on the
true deity of Jesus Christ.
Conclusion
You may be saying to yourself, “Fred, this is a little over my head.” If that’s what
you’re thinking right now, then good! That’s exactly what you should be thinking right
now! This is something that is over all of our heads! The idea of God becoming a human
being is something that none of our finite human minds can comprehend. This is a
teaching that should astonish us and leave us speechless. That man named Jesus who
walked through ancient Judea preaching and teaching and who was crucified on the cross
and then rose again—oh, he is so much more than any of us can take in.
God himself is so much more than we can ever grasp. Just think about where this
teaching about Jesus takes us. What does it say to us about God? If Jesus is truly God,
but he is not the Father, then are there two Gods? That can’t be because the Bible tells
us that there is only one true God. So how do we put all that together? Studying what the
Bible teaches about Jesus eventually leads to what we call the doctrine of the Trinity.
There is one God who exists in three distinct Persons. The Father is God; the Son is
God; and the Holy Spirit God. But they are not three different Gods. There is one God
who exists in three Persons. And again you say, “Fred, I can’t begin to understand that.”
Good! You never will be able to take all that in. God is so much more than human
language can describe and so much more than our human minds can comprehend. “One
God in three Persons”—that’s the best that we can do, but let’s quickly admit that those
words do not really do justice the mystery and the majesty of the living God. Let yourself
be astonished. That is how you should respond!
But then let your astonishment turn to gratitude. Be thankful. Who is it that came
to this earth to be born in a manger? Who gave himself up to be crucified on the cross?
Who died for your sins and mine? Did God raise up some special man or woman to do all
that? No. Did God send one of his angels to do that for you and me? That would be
wonderful, but that’s not what the Bible teaches. Did God create some lesser deity to
come and win our salvation? No, God did more than that! God himself came to be our
Savior. Isn’t it amazing to think that he would love you and me that much?
Let’s worship God and let’s thank him that Jesus—“true God from true God”—
came for you and me!

",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",12/8/2013,
"I am going to start this morning by giving you a warning. My goal for today and the next
two Sundays is to stretch you to the point where you think that you are going to break apart! I
want you to challenge you to think about Christmas as you never have before.
For most of us Christmas is a time when we hear and think about that familiar Christmas
story. We picture Joseph and Mary making their way to Bethlehem. We can see the baby Jesus
lying in the manger. We imagine what it would be like to be one of the shepherds out in the field
with the sheep. We can almost hear the angels singing. December rolls around and all those
familiar scenes come flooding back into our minds. That’s Christmas. It is a time for reflective
nostalgia over a story that we know so well.
Not this Christmas! Not if I’ve got anything to do with your Christmas this year. This year I
want to stretch your mind and your heart to the point where you say, “Fred, please don’t tell me
anything more! This is more than I can take in! This is more than I am ready to deal with! Please
don’t tell me anything more!” If I can get you to the point where you say that, then I’ll be satisfied
that you are ready for Christmas.
There are really only two questions that are essential to Christmas, and they have nothing to
do with giving or getting presents. Here are the two questions: Who is Jesus? What are you going
to do with him? Answer those two questions, and you will have dealt with everything that really
matters when it comes to Christmas. Who is Jesus? What are you personally going to do with him?
Those are the two questions that we are going to wrestle with today and the next two
Sundays. This morning we are going to do a simple Bible study looking at what the Gospel of
John teaches us about Jesus of Nazareth. Then in the following weeks we will wrestle with the
information that John gives to us. John states his teachings about Jesus in simple language and
in a straightforward manner. But here’s the challenge: how do we take all that information about
Jesus and put it together in our minds so that we begin to feel like we have grasped whom Jesus
truly is? That is not an easy task. It took the early Christians almost four hundred years to come
to the point where they felt like they could confidently describe in their own words who Jesus is.
We’re going to try to do it in just three weeks. Even then we won’t be done. We will still have to
wrestle with what we are going to do with Jesus. It’s fine to describe him and to think that you
have a somewhat adequate grasp on his existence and character and mission. But will you allow
him to change your heart and redirect your life? That’s an entirely different matter.
Two questions: Who is Jesus? What are you going to do with him?
His Miracles
Let’s think about what the New Testament tells us about Jesus. One of the things that
first grabs your attention when you read the New Testament is that Jesus performs miracles. It
doesn’t make any difference whether you read John’s account of Jesus’ life or whether you read
one of the other three Gospels—Matthew, Mark, or Luke. Their testimony is unanimous. Jesus
does amazing things. He turns water into wine (John 2:1-11). He somehow walks across the
surface of a lake (John 6:16-21). All four of the Gospel writers record how Jesus feeds 5,000
people from just five loaves of bread and two fish (Matt. 14:15-21; Mark 6:35-44; Luke 9:12-17;
John 6:1-13). He also gives convincing demonstrations that he can heal people. It isn’t just a
psychosomatic kind of healing. He heals people who can’t walk and can’t see (John 5:1-9; 9:1-7).
Jesus even raises someone back to life—someone who has been dead for several days (John
11:1-44). Who does things like that? Magicians and illusionists and even con artists can pull off
some pretty convincing stunts. But who can do all those miracles? What do they tell you about
who Jesus is?
His Message
Think about his miracles. Think also about his message. Let’s look at one example of his
teaching.
16 So, because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders
began to persecute him.
17
In his defense Jesus said to them, “My Father is always at his
work to this very day, and I too am working.”
18 For this reason they tried all the more to
kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own
Father, making himself equal with God. (John 5:16-18)
When I read those words, my first thought is that the Jewish leaders are overreacting a bit. I
know that in the first century individual Jews do not address God as their Father. Nobody dares
to describe himself as having that kind of relationship with Almighty God. Jesus is doing
something a little out of the ordinary for the first century. But is he really making himself equal
with God like the Jewish leaders think he is?
19
Jesus gave them this answer: “Very truly I tell you, the Son can do nothing by
himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does
the Son also does.
20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, and he
will show him even greater works than these, so that you will be amazed.” (John 5:19-20)
What do you think of that? Jesus does seem to be a little on the edge here. He’s flirting with
some pretty wild claims. To say that he does the same things as God his Father does—that is
quite a grandiose declaration to make about yourself. But can’t we give Jesus the benefit of the
doubt? Is he really going quite so far as to make himself equal with God?
21
“For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to
whom he is pleased to give it.
22 Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all
judgment to the Son,
23
that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever
does not honor the Son does not honor the Father, who sent him.” (John 5:21-23)
What do you think about that? When I read those words, I understand what is getting the Jewish
leaders so worked up. Jesus has definitely crossed the line here. He says that he has the power
to give life just like his Father does. He says that he has the authority to judge a person just like
his Father does. And then he drops the biggest bombshell of them all. He says that he deserves
to be honored just as his Father is honored. Look at that again. “. . . that all may honor the Son
or me just as they honor the Father.” Jesus is saying that people should honor him in exactly the
same way that they honor God. Then he repeats that point just to make sure that the Jewish
leaders get it. “He who does not honor me does not honor God who sent me. If you don’t honor
me, you are not honoring God!” What kind of a person says things like that about himself? Who
does he think that he is?
We’ve looked briefly at his miracles and his message. We could easily look at other
things that Jesus says (John 8:58; 10:30; 14:6). But haven’t we already seen enough? What
kind of person does these things that Jesus does? He does things that some kind of divine
person would do. Then there are those things that Jesus says. He makes such bold and
audacious claims about himself. It sounds almost blasphemous to suggest such a thing, but
Jesus talks as if he is God himself!
His Life
That in itself has got to make you stop and think. But it’s only part of the overall puzzle.
There are other things that John tells us about Jesus that makes him seem like someone who is so
much like you and me. For example, let’s look at one of his encounters with the Pharisees. Think
not so much about the main point that Jesus is making but at the way that he describes himself.
39
“Abraham is our father,” they answered.
“If you were Abraham’s children,” said Jesus, “then you would do what Abraham
did.
40 As it is, you are looking for a way to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I
heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.” (John 8:39-40 emphasis added)
Jesus says that he is a “man.” Yes, he is “a man who has told you the truth,” but he is still a man.
That’s pretty straightforward, isn’t it? Who is Jesus? Jesus himself says that he is a man.
Look now at his daily existence. Jesus is going up to Galilee, and he travels through
Samaria. “Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, tired as he was from the journey, sat down by the
well. It was about noon” (John 4:6 emphasis added). Did you catch that? Jesus was tired from
his journey. Wait a minute! I thought that Jesus was the guy who walked on water and had the
power to heal people who couldn’t walk at all. Now we’re told that he got tired from just taking a
long hike down the road? He doesn’t sound powerful or divine there, does he? In fact, doesn’t
he sound a lot like you and me there? We get tired too.
That’s not all. Read on. “When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to
her, ‘Will you give me a drink?’"" (John 4:7). Maybe Jesus just said that so that he could start a
conversation with this woman, but there also seems to be a strong possibility that he was just
plain thirsty. (See John 19:28 for another example of thirst.) Wait a minute! I thought Jesus was
the guy who could feed five thousand people from five loaves of bread and a couple of fish and
could turn water into wine. But he asks this woman to fetch him a glass of water because he is
thirsty? That sounds like something you and I might do.
His Death
There is something else we should consider. Think about the fact of his death. Jesus
dies. Does the Almighty God of the Bible die? That’s a stupid question, isn’t it? But Jesus dies.
And what a miserable death it is! There isn’t anything noble about having some Roman soldiers
nail you to a piece of wood and then hoist you up into the air and leave you there to die (John
19:16-18). That kind of thing doesn’t happen to superheroes, and it certainly doesn’t happen to
God! But it’s exactly what happens to Jesus.
Who Is Jesus?
So who is Jesus? What conclusion are you going to reach about him? On the one hand,
he is God. On the other hand, he is just a human being. Look at how John draws those two
things together. In the opening verse of the book, John uses some theological terminology that
people in the first century would have been more familiar with than we are. John uses the term
Word to refer to the person we know as Jesus. “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
was with God, and the Word was God”(John 1:1). Now look at what John says in verse 14. “The
Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.” Put those two verses together. The
Word, who according to verse 1 was God, became a human being and lived here on earth. John
uses even stronger language than that. He says that the Word became “flesh.” It’s almost as if
John wants to make it as clear as possible to us that God did not just appear to be human. He
didn’t just look like he had skin and hair. He wasn’t wearing a costume pretending to be
something that he really wasn’t. No, John says, “God became flesh.”
When you realize what John is actually saying about Jesus, then immediately, if you have
any brain at all, you have to ask a whole lot of questions. How could God actually become
human? We can understand how he might appear to be human, but how could God actually
become a human being? Was God still God after he became a human? Was he as much God
after he became a man as he was before? Or did he have to lose some of his deity in order to
become a man? Did his divine nature go through some kind of change when he became human?
Or look at it from the opposite angle: Did Jesus’ humanness remain as real genuine humanness
like ours if he was also God? What kind of a human is also God?
We’re just getting warmed up. We can ask more questions than just those. If Jesus was
truly God, then whom did he pray to? Did he just pray to himself? And here is an even bigger
question: When Jesus died on the cross, did God die too? Just to ask those kinds of questions
boggles your mind!
Those are the questions that we will be looking for the next two Sundays. Maybe the
easiest way out of this extraordinary theological puzzle is just to say that John invented the whole
thing. The Gospel of John is fiction. Oh, it’s pious fiction. It’s inspiring and moving, but let’s not
get carried away with it. Back in the first century lots of people believed in these divine hero
types, and John is just one of them. John just goes one step further than anybody else did. He
takes this contemporary inspirational Jewish rabbi named Jesus and turns him into God. That’s
all there is to. It’s a great story, but it is after all just a story. Don’t get too worked up over it.
There’s one major problem with that explanation. John is Jewish. So are Matthew and
Mark for that matter. The apostle Paul is too. In fact, all the writers of the New Testament are
Jewish except for Luke. How likely is it that Jewish people in the first century would invent and
believe and risk their lives for a story about God becoming a human being?
Among the Jews of the first century, there were a variety of religious beliefs, but they all
agreed on one thing. God was holy and transcendent. Anything that would reduce him or bring
him down was instinctively repulsive to the Jews. Without even giving it a second thought, they
would immediately reject anything that would reduce God and his majesty.
There’s a fascinating account that the Jewish historian named Josephus records.
Josephus writes about an event that takes place while Pontius Pilate is the governor of the land.
Pilate secretly has some Roman standards brought into the city of Jerusalem. A Roman standard
is nothing but a long pole with some kind of Roman symbol up on top of it. When the Jewish
people learn that Pilate has snuck these Roman standards into Jerusalem, they are furious. The
Jews think of these Roman symbols as graven images or as idols, and they will not sit still
knowing that idols have been brought into their holy city. So a large crowd of them goes off to
see Pilate, and they plead with him to take the Roman standards out of Jerusalem. Pilate doesn’t
care what they want. He has his soldiers surround them, and the soldiers all take out their
swords. Then Pilate tells the Jews that they have a choice. They can either accept the standards
or they can be cut to pieces by the soldiers! Immediately the crowd throws themselves on the
ground, and they pull down their robes from their necks. They tell Pilate to order his soldiers to
kill them. Pilate is so amazed at their devotion to God that he has the Roman standards taken
out of the Jerusalem.
1
The Jewish people of the first century are convinced of the transcendent holiness and
majesty of God. They immediately reject anything that reduces God or challenges his unique
honor. No Jewish person of the first century would ever dream of inventing a story about God
becoming a human being who gets tired and needs a drink of water. The living and almighty God
becomes a man? No Jew would dare say such a thing! But the New Testament writers speak of
Jesus that way. What makes them do that? This isn’t pious fiction. That explanation simply will
not do. Something remarkable has taken place. Or, better yet, someone who is so striking, so
original, so baffling yet so compelling has brought them to the point where they can only conclude
that he is himself God in the flesh.

What conclusion will you come to about Jesus? Who is he? What will you do with him?
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",12/1/2013,
"Thanksgiving is work. Let’s admit that. Giving thanks is not something that comes naturally to us.
Are there any parents here this morning who have not needed to teach their children to say, “Thank you”?
Giving thanks is a learned behavior. It takes time and effort. It's work!
Stop and think about it for a moment. Have you ever had a Thanksgiving Day in which you ate the
food, maybe took a walk or a nap, then played a game or dozed off in front of a football game, and then at the
end of the day you realized that you had not taken any time during the day to actually express your thanks to
God? Has that ever happened to you? Thanksgiving does not come naturally. Thanksgiving is work!
All of us, if we want to, can look at our lives and be negative. None of us live in paradise. If we want
to find things to complain about—if we want to pity ourselves—if we want to go through life bitter and
resentful for what we do not have, we can do that. It's easy to be negative. But God wants us to do the
work—make the effort—take the time to ponder his goodness to us.
Let’s take a look at Psalm 107. This is not a difficult passage of Scripture to understand. The
message is simple and straightforward. Here is a poem in God’s Word whose purpose is to encourage us
to ponder what God has provided for us and then to give thanks. The first three verses state the theme.
1 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good;
his love endures forever.
2
Let the redeemed of the LORD tell their story—
those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,
3
those he gathered from the lands,
from east and west, from north and south. (Psalm 107:1-3)
Then the writer gives us four examples or illustrations of God's love. He starts with an example of
how God has provided the most basic of needs—food and shelter.
4 Some wandered in desert wastelands,
finding no way to a city where they could settle.
5 They were hungry and thirsty,
and their lives ebbed away.
6 Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,
and he delivered them from their distress.
7 He led them by a straight way
to a city where they could settle.
8
Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love
and his wonderful deeds for mankind,
9
for he satisfies the thirsty
and fills the hungry with good things. (Psalm 107:4-9)
Did you have something to eat this morning? Did you have a place to lay your head last night?
Were you healthy enough to come to church this morning and worship God with your friends? It’s easy to
take all those things for granted. That’s why we need to take to heart the instruction in verse 8. “Let them
give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind.”
The next two stanzas of the poem, verses 10 through 16 and then verses 17 through 22, provide us
with another reason for giving thanks to God. These two stanzas record the experience of people who have
rebelled against God and suffered the consequences for their disobedience. But then God forgave them
and rescued them.
10 Some sat in darkness, in utter darkness,
prisoners suffering in iron chains,
11
because they rebelled against God’s commands
and despised the plans of the Most High.
12 So he subjected them to bitter labor;
they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
13 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble,
and he saved them from their distress.
14 He brought them out of darkness, the utter darkness,
and broke away their chains.
15
Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love
and his wonderful deeds for mankind,
16
for he breaks down gates of bronze
and cuts through bars of iron. (Psalm 107:10-16)
Is there anyone here today who can identify with what the writer says in that section of the poem?
Have there been any times recently in which you turned your back on the Lord? Or maybe you just ignored
him for a while. You didn't reject him outright; you just put him on the shelf for a while to that he would be out
of the way. But then it hit you that you were really only hurting yourself, so you repented. You discovered to
your amazement and relief that God had not forgotten you. “Give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love.”
Verses 23 through 32 provide the final illustration. This time the writer describes a crisis situation.
23 Some went out on the sea in ships;
they were merchants on the mighty waters.
24 They saw the works of the LORD,
his wonderful deeds in the deep.
25 For he spoke and stirred up a tempest
that lifted high the waves.
26 They mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths;
in their peril their courage melted away.
27 They reeled and staggered like drunkards;
they were at their wits’ end.
28 Then they cried out to the LORD in their trouble,
and he brought them out of their distress.
29 He stilled the storm to a whisper;
the waves of the sea were hushed.
30 They were glad when it grew calm,
and he guided them to their desired haven.
31
Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love
and his wonderful deeds for mankind.
32
Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people
and praise him in the council of the elders. (Psalm 107:23-32)
Some of us here this morning look back over this past year, and we immediatetly think of the severe
trials that we have gone through or that we are still going through. There’s the automobile accident. Your
child is in trouble with the law. You remember the fire in your house, the broken engagement, or divorce.
You can still recall the exact words that the doctor used when he gave you the bad news. You think of your
loved one who suddenly died. And you wonder where God's love was in all of that? Let's freely admit that
there are times when God's ways are beyond us.
But as we do the hard work of thanksgiving we remember that we have been through other trials.
They were severe. In fact, it still hurts to even think about them. But God did bring us through them, and
we are confident that God in some way and in his own timing will bring us through the trials that we are
facing now. So even now we give thanks to God for the promise of his unfailing love.
Look at the way Psalm 107 ends. “Let the one who is wise heed these things and ponder the loving
deeds of the Lord.” Some translations say that we should be “consider the loving deeds of the Lord.”
That’s a good translation, but I like that word ponder. It communicates to me that thanksgiving is work. It
takes time and effort. Let’s do that work and make that effort. Let’s “ponder the loving deeds of the Lord,”
and then express our thanks to God.",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",11/24/2013,
"Over the years I have become convinced that the best way to read the Bible is not verse
by verse but paragraph by paragraph and section by section and book by book. Sometimes we
Christians concentrate so much attention on single verses in the Bible that we, in effect, treat
God’s Word as if it is nothing but a big collection of short statements or proverbs that can stand
alone and be understood all by themselves.
But that is not the way that the Bible is written. Take the New Testament book of 2
Corinthians. When Paul writes this letter by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, he does not collect
a bunch of memorable one-liners about God and then string them together. Instead he writes a
letter. The best way to read 2 Corinthians is to read it as a letter.
How do you read a letter that you receive in the mail? Do you read one or two
sentences and then put it aside and read another one or two sentences the next day? Of
course not! You read it the entire letter at the same time. That’s the best way to read 2
Corinthians. Sit down and read the entire letter all at one time. Or, at the very least, read a
section of the letter or several paragraphs of the letter in one sitting.
That’s what I have been trying to do in our study of 2 Corinthians. In the last couple of
months I have wanted so many times to slow down and linger over a verse or two. But I have
resisted that temptation because I am convinced that I can serve you better by helping you
understand and appreciate the flow and major message of this letter to the Corinthians. That is
accomplished best by preaching section by section.
But now that I have explained my general approach to preaching, I have to tell you that
there are some verses in the Bible that are so bursting with significance that we have to stop
and linger over them. They deserve to be enjoyed and relished and savored. So this morning I
want to return to the section that we studied last Sunday and meditate on two verses in that
section.
We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through
us. We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God. God made him who had no
sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. (2 Cor.
5:20-21)
Please note right at the outset that according to those two Bible verses a relationship
with God is not automatic. If that were true, there would be no need for the apostle Paul to
make the urgent plea that he does in verse 20. “We implore you—we plead with you—we beg
you—please be reconciled to God!”
So often people today assume that God has to love them because that is his job! If
anyone anywhere at any time shows the slightest interest in God, he is obligated to respond to
that person. But that is not what the New Testament teaches. The Bible teaches that you and I
are alienated from God. We are estranged from him. In other words, our relationship with God
is broken. It is in bad need of repair! Why is that? Each and every one of us offends the living
God by the way that we disobey him or even worse by the way we ignore him. How long do you
and I go without paying him the slightest attention? We, in effect, dismiss God as if he is not
worthy of our time. Oh, if we really need him, then we want him around. But most of the time
we act as if we can pretty much get along without him. That amounts to an insult to the Person
who created us. So Paul here pleads with us. “Please give your relationship with God some
serious thought. Please recognize the problem that you’ve got. Please be reconciled to God!”
How does that reconciliation with the living God take place? How do you get a
relationship with God? The answer is in verse 21. “God made him who had no sin to be sin for
us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” At the very least, that verse tells
us that we can be reconciled to God through Jesus Christ. He is the one who is being described
there. It is in Jesus Christ that the barriers to a relationship with God can be overcome.
To trust in Christ means that you say, “Jesus, I know that I have blown it. I know that I
have insulted God by the way I have acted toward him and tried to live without him. I know that
God really doesn’t owe me a thing. But I want to have a relationship with God. So right now I’m
asking you to do for me what I cannot do for myself. I’m giving up on myself and my own
efforts, and I’m trusting you to be my Savior. I’m counting on you alone to make me acceptable
to God.” Have you ever said that to God? If not, then I want to say to you what Paul writes to
the Corinthians: “We implore you on Christ's behalf: Be reconciled to God.” Don’t wait any
longer. “Trust in Christ now. Be reconciled to God now.”
What happens when you are reconciled to God? This is the point that I want to stress
this morning. Verse 21 teaches an astounding truth.
God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the
righteousness of God. (2 Cor. 5:21)
That single verse describes a great exchange that has taken place, and grasping the full
dimensions of that exchange will change your life.
Look at what has happened. “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us.” Jesus of
Nazareth never sinned. He was perfectly righteous in the sight of God. Yet he took our sin
upon himself. Paul states it in the strongest possible way. “He became sin.” He doesn’t say
that Christ became a sinner. No, Christ “became sin.” In other words, God started to treat him
the way that sin deserves to be treated. When Jesus was hanging on the cross, he was
experiencing the full punishment that sin and rebellion against God deserves. Our sin was fully
on him. That in itself is life-transforming truth. To know that our sins have been taken care of
and that we can be forgiven—that’s good news.
But this verse says so much more. Verse 21 describes not only what Jesus took that
was ours. It also teaches us what we received that belonged to Jesus. An exchange has taken
place. “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might . . . get a second
chance.” We’ve failed before but now in Christ we get an opportunity to try again to live the way
that God wants us to. That would be good news, but that’s not what this verse teaches. Or
maybe we should look at it this way: “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in
him we might become . . . more respectable.” Before trusting in Christ, our sins were more
obvious, but now through Jesus we get to clean up our act and really look a lot better. No, no.
That’s closer, but that’s not it either.
Second Corinthians 5:21 gives us far better news than that. “God made him who had no
sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” Let that verse
sink in. Jesus takes our sin, and God treats him as sin deserves. He dies on the cross. That’s
the first half of the verse. And what do we get in exchange? “The righteousness of God.” Did
you hear that? God treats us as if we are as righteous as he himself is. That’s the exchange!
Christ gets our sins, and we receive his righteous standing with his Father.
It may sound as if it is too good to be true, but it is true! If you trust in Jesus Christ as
your Savior, then verse 21 says that you now possess “the righteousness of God.” God looks at
you and says, “You are not just forgiven and pardoned. You are innocent in my sight. It is as if
you had never sinned at all! You are as righteous and pure as I am and as my Son is.” Do you
hear that? God says that a great exchange has taken place. Jesus has taken our sins, and he
has given to us in exchange his righteous standing with God.
If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, please take this message to heart!
Do you ever wonder what God really thinks of you? It is one thing to give the correct
doctrinal answer to that question when you are sitting in church on Sunday morning. But what
answer do you give when you’ve just done something that’s wrong? You knew it was wrong,
but you went ahead and did it anyway. And it’s not the first time you have ever given into that
temptation. You’ve done this thing before. And, yes, you have confessed your sin to God like
you know you should. And, yes, you do know that you are forgiven. But if you are like me, you
still feel miserable about it. And you wonder, “Is God getting tired of me? Sometimes I get tired
of myself. I wonder if God is tired of me too.”
Listen again to 2 Corinthians 5:21. “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so
that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (emphasis added).
Please listen carefully! If you are trusting in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, God
has not just granted you a new but impersonal status. He has personally reconciled you to
himself. Think of it this way. Have you ever gone to another country and had to pass through
passport control? The agent behind the desk stares at you and then looks as your picture in
your passport and then stamps your passport and lets you into the country. You get in. But
there is no thrill in the passport agents’ eyes. It’s all impersonal! That’s not the way it is with
God. God stamps the passport that Jesus has given you, and he allows you into his presence.
And he is thrilled! You are a citizen of heaven now! A new relationship with God now exists.
Through Jesus God gladly claims you as his own. He delights to call you his child. Because of
Jesus and his death on the cross, God is now wildly crazy about you! Do you hear that?
Through Jesus Christ you have a new standing with God, and it is secure! He looks at
you and says, “You are as pure and innocent as Jesus himself. My Son Jesus has given you
his righteousness, and it will never be taken away from you. Therefore, you don’t need to worry
about your relationship with me. I entered into this relationship with my eyes wide open. I know
that you will still do things that are wrong, and I do expect you to confess your sins to me. But
rest assured that I am delighted to call you my child. I have declared you righteous through my
Son Jesus. I have reconciled you. You are mine, and you will be forever!”
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",11/17/2013,
"One of the issues that I wrestle with regularly as a pastor is what we should be doing as
a church. What is the core ministry of the church of Jesus Christ? What is essential to the life
of the church?
I ask that question because our church like all churches receives all kinds of suggestions
about activities that we should get involved in. Often those suggestions come from people outside
of the church. But they also arise from within the church. The church should be doing more for
our young people and more for our senior citizens. The church should take a greater interest in
addressing the problem of injustice in the world. The church should speak out more directly on the
pressing political issues of our day. The church should be doing more to alleviate poverty.
Those are all good suggestions. I am happy to tell you that we do not get many
requests as a church to participate in bad things. No one yet has asked us to hold a clinic here
on how to make a bomb out of a pressure cooker! We don’t get requests like that. The
requests that we get are all good. But those suggestions also make me wonder. What should
we as a church be concentrating on? Are we just a humanitarian organization that exists for the
purpose of contributing to every good cause that comes along? Or is there something that is
unique to the church? Is there something essential to the life and ministry of the Christian
church that we must be careful not to neglect?
This morning we’re continuing in our study of Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians. In
this letter Paul uses a lot of ink in writing about his ministry. From chapter 2 verse 14 all the
way through chapter 7 verse 4, Paul is explaining why he perseveres in his ministry even
though he has encountered so many hardships in it. In our passage this morning, 2 Corinthians
5:11-6:2, Paul continues on that theme, but he takes a slight change in direction. In this section
Paul actually does two things. He defends his ministry and he explains his ministry.
Paul defends his ministry because there are people in Corinth who are questioning his
character and undermining his leadership. These people say that Paul is unreliable (2 Cor.
2:17) and unimpressive (2 Cor. 11:5-6, 20). So Paul makes a few comments to defend himself
against those accusations. But then he goes on and explains his ministry. That is what we are
going to focus on this morning. In this section of his letter we learn what he considers to be
essential to his work as an apostle and to the work of the church as a whole. Two major themes
emerge in Paul’s words: persuasion and reconciliation.
Persuasion: “We try to persuade others.”
We will start with persuasion. “Since, then, we know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to
persuade others” (2 Cor. 5:11a). Paul is in the persuasion business. He has a message. He
wants to pass it along, and he wants to persuade or convince other people to believe in what he
has to tell them about God.
Why does Paul want to persuade others to believe in his message? He gives two
reasons. The first one is found in verse 11. “Since . . . we know what it is to fear the Lord, we
try to persuade others.” The first reason behind Paul’s ministry is the fear of the Lord.
“The fear of the Lord” is an expression that we don’t use very often today, but we find it
frequently in the Old Testament. A few years ago I did a study on that expression. I wanted to
find out for myself what the Bible means when it talks about “the fear of the Lord,” and here is
the conclusion that I arrived at. “The fear of the Lord means submitting to God—not out of terror
but out of trust.” Fearing God leads to submission or obedience. There is an element of
authority in the expression, but it is not coercive or terrifying. Fearing God produces an
obedience that comes from the heartfelt conviction that God can be trusted even when he asks
us to do something difficult. That’s what Paul is talking about in verse 11. Paul seeks to
persuade people even when he knows that it is likely that they will reject his message.
Let’s put it in modern terms: God is someone who needs to be taken seriously. So
often today people approach God casually. “If you are one of those people who is into religion
or spirituality, that’s fine. But if you are not like that, that’s OK too. It is entirely up to you. You
can take God or leave him—whatever you want to do. Of course, if you are really in a jam, you
might want to pray. God will listen. Of course, he will. He has too because that’s his job!”
That modern casual approach to God is the complete opposite of the way that the Bible
presents God. God is just as real as this pulpit! He is not an extra. He is not just an option for
you to consider. You and I owe our existence to God, and some day we will stand before him to
give an account of the way that we have lived.
It’s with that understanding of God that Paul goes about his ministry. “Since . . . we
know what it is to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others.” In verses 12 and 13 Paul explains
how that knowledge about God defines everything he does as an apostle. Then in verse 14 he
gives the second reason he wants to persuade others.
14 For Christ’s love compels us, because we are convinced that one died for all, and
therefore all died.
15 And he died for all, that those who live should no longer live for
themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again. (2 Cor. 5:14-15)
Paul’s ministry is driven by the fear of the Lord and the love of Christ. “Christ’s love
compels us.” Paul has experienced the love of Christ in his own life. Think of the famous story
of his conversion on the road to Damascus. Paul is out to capture and kill Christians, but then
Jesus himself miraculously appears to Paul and Paul’s entire life turns around (Acts 9:1-1-19;
22:1-21; 26:9-18). That’s what is behind these words.
Paul knows from his own experience how the love of Christ changes your perspective on
life itself and on other people too. In verses 16 and 17 Paul describes the effects of his own
experience with Christ.
16 So from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view. Though we
once regarded Christ in this way [as a worthless and crucified liar], we do so no longer.
17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the
new is here! (2 Cor. 5:16-17)
Paul knows who God is. He understands the majesty and authority of God. Paul also
has experienced in his own life the love of Jesus Christ. Therefore, he cannot be quiet. The
fear of God and the love of Christ compel him to persuade others of the message that God has
given to him.
Reconciliation: “Be reconciled to God.”
What is the message that Paul wants to persuade others of? Starting in verse 18 Paul
explains it, and he uses the word “reconciliation.” He uses one form or another of that word four
times in verses 18 and 19.
18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us
the ministry of reconciliation:
19
that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ,
not counting people’s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of
reconciliation. (2 Cor. 5:18-19 emphasis added)
What is reconciliation? It’s not difficult to understand. The basic idea behind
reconciliation is making peace. It’s a term used in relationships. Two people are angry at each
other. There is a problem between them. They are separated or alienated from each other.
Reconciliation takes place when that hostility is replaced by peace. Anger is exchanged for
kindness. Enemies become friends. That is reconciliation.
In this passage Paul explains three basic aspects of reconciliation. He writes about the
need for reconciliation. Paul identifies that need as sin. In verse 19 he talks about how sin has
created a barrier between us and God, but reconciliation means that God is “not counting
people’s sins against them.”
What is sin? People often think of sin as something really bad! No. Basically sin means
that I like to think of myself as the center of the universe. I like to think that the whole world
should work the way that I want it to. It's not that I go out and announce that to everybody, but
that's the way I act. I wake up in the morning, and I immediately start thinking about what I want
to do. At the breakfast table I hope that I get the cereal that I want and that nobody else gets to
it first. That's the way that it goes the whole day. I think about what I want, and I often get
miffed or downright angry if I don't get what I want.
The thing that is really sad about sin is that I don't have to work at it. I have to exert
some effort to think about other people and what they want, but it is so easy to think just about
myself. Without even trying, I act as if I am the center of the universe. You know what I’m
talking about, don’t you?
But the truth is that God is at the center of the universe, not you or me. The world will
continue to spin without us, but it won't without God. For us to act as if we are sitting on God's
throne means, in effect, that we are rebels trying to overthrow God’s rule. That’s why sin
alienates us from God. That’s why we need to be reconciled to God.
If sin creates the need, where can we find the solution? Look at verse 19 again. “God
was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people’s sins against them”
(emphasis added). Reconciliation comes through Jesus. Our sins can be forgiven through
Christ. He’s the solution to the problem of sin. The New Testament teaches that Jesus
willingly took the punishment for our sin and rebellion on himself. He paid the penalty that we
deserved so that our sins could be entirely forgiven.
Paul condenses that idea so memorably in verse 21. “God made him who had no sin to
be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.” There is an exchange
that takes place. Jesus takes our sins, and he gives us his righteousness in its place. Stop and
think about that exchange. What a deal! Jesus takes the punishment for our rebellion, and we
get his righteous relationship with God. That sounds too good to be true, doesn’t it?
Think of it this way. Suppose someone really rich like J.K. Rolling or Warren Buffet or
Mark Zuckerberg—whoever your favorite billionaire is—asks you to swap your twenty-five year
old oil-burning rust bucket of a car for a brand new Mercedes that has all the bells and whistles
imaginable. Wait a minute! Mercedes? What am I talking about? Who would want a
Mercedes? How about a Rolls Royce or a Bentley—a Lamborghini or a Ferrari! And it will be
an even swap! Your billionaire will also pay for the insurance for the car! You get the expensive
car, and they get your wreck. It’s as simple as that!
That’s what is being described here. Jesus Christ takes our guilty and embarrassing sin,
and he gives us his pure and loving relationship to God. What a deal!
The need for reconciliation comes from sin. The solution to sin is found in Jesus Christ.
That leaves one final aspect to reconciliation. It’s the ministry of reconciliation or more
specifically what I would call the plea.
Look at verse 18 once again. “All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through
Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation” (emphasis added). I have to say something
about that phrase—“the ministry of reconciliation.” I cannot tell you how many times I have
heard people quote that verse about God giving us “the ministry of reconciliation.” As soon as
they quote it, they immediately talk about how the church should be working toward reconciling
the rich and the poor and the advantaged and the disadvantaged. The church, they say, should
be bringing together people from different racial or ethnic groups and helping them be at peace
with each other.
That is not what this passage of God’s Word is talking about. Please listen to me
carefully. I believe in reconciliation between human beings, and the Bible does address that
issue. The apostle Paul himself writes in Ephesians about how the bitter first century barrier
between Jews and Gentiles was overcome in Christ (Eph. 2:14-18). But that is not what Paul is
talking about in 2 Corinthians 5. Here in this passage Paul is talking about a more serious and
fundamental alienation. It is the separation that we human beings have from our Creator.
The ministry of reconciliation is the duty and privilege that we have as Christians to tell
others how they can be forgiven by God and come into a living and vital relationship with him.
That is the core ministry of the church of Jesus Christ. It is that essential ministry that makes
the church different from every other organization on earth. While other forms of service are
important and have their place, they must not be allowed to take the place of telling others about
Jesus and how they can become a “new creation” in him.
There are humanitarian organizations dedicated to resolving racial and ethnic tension
and aiding the poor in their distress. Thank God for those organizations! They are needed! But
none of those organizations are going to do the work that only the church can do. It is the
church of Jesus Christ alone that proclaims how men and women and boys and girls can
experience the forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ, and we must not allow ourselves to slip
away from the primacy and urgency of that message.
At the heart of “the ministry of reconciliation” is a plea. Listen to Paul as he states it in
verse 20. “We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal
through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God” (emphasis added).
That’s the plea. The New International Version and the English Standard Version and the New
King James Version all say, “We implore you.” I don’t know about you, but I don’t use the word,
“implore,” very often. The New American Standard Version puts it in language that I am more
used to: “We beg you.” Whatever word you want to use, notice the urgency of what Paul is
saying. “Be reconciled to God! Please don’t miss out on being forgiven and experiencing
Christ’s love!”
Notice who it is that Paul is saying this to. In chapter 6 Paul goes on and directs that
plea specifically to the people in the church in Corinth.
1 As God’s co-workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain.
2 For he
says,
“In the time of my favor I heard you,
and in the day of salvation I helped you.”
I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation. (2 Cor. 6:1-2)
Paul is asking the people who are in the Christian community in Corinth to make sure that they
have actually been reconciled to God through Jesus Christ by faith. Paul is aware that people
can be connected to a Christian community but still not be believers in Christ. So he issues his
plea to them, “We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God.”
As a pastor my greatest fear is that someone might come to our church and miss out on
what is truly essential. You may come to church regularly. You may know all the songs. You
may be involved in lots of activities here in the church. But have you trusted in God’s Son,
Jesus Christ, as your Lord? Please be sure that you don’t miss out on Jesus.
God’s love is not something that should be assumed. God offers it to us, and we need
to respond to the invitation. Will you bow before God and say, “God, I need you. I do act as if I
am the center of the world, and I know that is wrong. I am a rebel against you, God. And I’m
glad to learn, God, that there is a way for my rebellion to be forgiven. Right now I’m telling you
that I accept your invitation. I want to be forgiven for my sins. I am trusting that Jesus can
make me right with you. I’m telling you right now that I believe he died on that cross for my sins,
and I want him to be the Lord and Master of my life from now on.”
Have you ever said that to God? If you haven’t, will you please do so today? Please
don’t miss out on what is essential.",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",11/10/2013,
"Some children were once asked what they thought about death. One boy said, ""Maybe
I'll die someday, but I hope I don't die on my birthday because it's no fun to celebrate your
birthday if you're dead."" That makes sense, doesn't it?
Here's another response. ""God doesn't tell you when you are going to die because He
wants it to be a big surprise.""
Listen to this one: ""You don't cry when you die, but you don't laugh either.""
Death. We all think about it, don’t we? But we don't always talk about it. Death has
been called the modern world’s only obscenity. It is the only unmentionable. We can talk about
almost anything today. We splash the most intimate of acts and the most violent of deeds
across the movie screens and television sets of our country. But death—that is a subject rarely
broached. Perhaps that in itself should tell us something. When people start fearing death in
earnest, they stop talking about it.
We must talk about it. Death has rightly been called life's ultimate certainty. Unless
Christ returns first, you will die. Your body will be disposed of. I know that doesn’t sound
dignified, but it’s true. Your body will either be lowered into the ground where it will decay, or it
will be cremated and reduced to ashes. I say that not to be morbid. That's reality.
One of the disturbing aspects of death is the inevitable way that it calls into question the
value of our lives here on this earth. Sooner or later people will forget you and me. We can
hope that doesn’t happen immediately, but it will happen eventually. How many of you can
provide a detailed life history of your great-grandparents? Do you even recall their names? The
same thing is going to happen to all of us. You and I will be forgotten too. So what real and
lasting value is there to our existence here on this earth?
This morning we are going to think about death, but we are also going to think about
heaven. For the believer in Jesus Christ, death is not our ultimate destination. Heaven is! And
the reality of heaven not only allows us to face the reality of death. It also provides us with hope
and motivation in this life.
Let’s take a look at what the apostle Paul tells us about heaven in 2 Corinthians 5:1-10.
In some ways this passage of Scripture is disappointing. I might as well tell you that right from
the beginning. Paul doesn’t tell us nearly as much about heaven as we would like to know.
You might wonder why Paul doesn’t say more about heaven in 2 Corinthians than he
does. The answer is simple. Paul is not writing about heaven as an intriguing curiosity. When
Paul writes this letter to the Corinthians, he is in the middle of a mess! As we have been
working away through 2 Corinthians, I have emphasized that over and over again. Paul uses a
little phrase in 2 Corinthians 7:5 to describe what he is facing. Do you remember it? “Conflicts
on the outside, fears within.” You need to keep that phrase in mind when you read this long
section of his letter that runs from chapter 2 verse 14 all the way through chapter 7 verse 4.
There was a riot in Ephesus that could have cost Paul his life. Paul is also battling with fears
over what is happening in the church in Corinth. What is it that keeps him going as he wrestles
with his conflicts and fears? As surprising as it may sound, one of the things that enables Paul
to persevere and endure is heaven.
Let’s listen to what he has to say about heaven and look at the conclusions that he
draws from heaven. Let’s learn from Paul about the value of heaven for life here on this earth.
Like Paul our lives sometimes appear to be one big mess. We have our conflicts and fears in
this life. Heaven kept Paul going, and it can give us motivation and hope too.
The Characteristics of Heaven
Paul describes heaven in three ways. First, he portrays heaven as a secure dwelling.
“For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, an
eternal house in heaven, not built by human hands” (2 Cor. 5:1).
Paul pictures our present existence in terms of a tent. Perhaps that image comes to his
mind because tent making is his trade (Acts 18:3). He has repaired enough tents in his day to
know how easily they can be damaged and destroyed. Tents do not offer a lot of security.
How many of you would like to spend this winter living in a tent? I know that there are
some guys in our church who enjoy winter camping. When the temperature gets below zero,
they think that’s the perfect time to pitch a tent. I don’t understand that mentality, but that’s OK.
But even those guys don’t spend all winter in their tents. Eventually they want something
warmer and more secure.
Of course, there is something worse than spending winter in a tent. It’s spending the
winter without any clothes on! “Meanwhile we groan, longing to be clothed instead with our
heavenly dwelling, because when we are clothed, we will not be found naked” (2 Cor. 5:2-3).
Paul has a habit of mixing his metaphors. He moves quickly from tents and houses to clothes.
Then he changes direction and introduces an emotional element to the discussion. “For while
we are in this tent, we groan and are burdened, because we do not wish to be unclothed but to
be clothed instead with our heavenly dwelling, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by
life” (2 Cor. 5:4 emphasis added).
It’s not that life here on this earth is all bad. That’s not true at all. As believers in Christ,
we do enjoy God’s love for us in this life. “Now the one who has fashioned us for this very
purpose is God, who has given us the Spirit as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come” (2 Cor.
5:5). As Christians we do experience the Holy Spirit’s work in our lives, but that work is just the
“deposit.” It is the “down payment” on our permanent dwelling in heaven. Making a down
payment on a house is good, but it is not the same as moving into that house.
As Christians, we look forward to a dwelling that is secure and unshakable and
permanent. These earthly tents of ours suffer wear and tear from age and accident and
disease. But we know that our life in heaven will not suffer from any of those limitations. Think
about that. No pulled muscles. No aches and pains. No cancer. No surgeries. No
wheelchairs. No visits to the doctor. Heaven offers us a permanently secure dwelling.
That’s one way of thinking about heaven. We should also think of it as a joyous
homecoming.
6 Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in
the body we are away from the Lord.
7 For we live by faith, not by sight.
8 We are
confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
(2 Cor. 5:6-8)
Think about that little phrase—to be “at home with the Lord.” This week I saw on the
news a report featuring a little boy in school. He was playing some kind of Halloween game at
school, and he had a blindfold on. Then his father, who had been serving in Afghanistan, snuck
into the classroom. When the blindfold came off, the little boy saw his dad! He ran to his dad
and hugged him! Oh, the joy of coming home!
What will it be like to be “at home with the Lord”? Even now in this life we have tasted of
God’s goodness, but we haven’t yet sat down for the full Thanksgiving feast. The Holy Spirit
lives within us assuring us of our salvation, and that is wonderful. But to be “at home” with
Christ? It will be so much better!
Think of heaven as a permanent dwelling and a joyous homecoming. Paul gives us one
additional picture. This one may not seem as enticing at first, but it is good. Heaven also
includes a fair evaluation. “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that
each of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or
bad” (2 Cor. 5:10).
Let’s be sure that we understand what Paul is teaching in that verse. How do you and I
become children of God and get to heaven? It’s not by trying to be good enough to earn God’s
love. The fact is that no matter how hard you and I try, we will never be good enough. We
become Christians by giving up on our own efforts to earn God’s attention and care. Instead we
admit that we cannot be all that God wants us to be. And then we turn to Jesus and tell him that
we are going to rely on him to do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. We are counting on
him and him alone to make us right with God. We believe that when he died on the cross, he
took the punishment for our sins on himself, so that as a result we can be totally forgiven. We
trust in Jesus and what he has done and not on what we have done or hope to do. That’s how
we become Christians.
If you have never consciously and deliberately told Jesus that you are counting on him
for the forgiveness of your sins, please do so! That’s how you become a child of God and get to
heaven.
Once we become Christians, we can enjoy God’s love and forgiveness. God also gives
us the privilege of living for him. It is a privilege and a responsibility. We need to take that
responsibility seriously. But please don’t think of verse 10 just in terms of responsibility. There
is also something extraordinarily encouraging about the truth presented here. This verse
teaches us that there is a connection between what we do here on this earth and what we will
enjoy in heaven.
To put it in its most simple terms: You can take it with you! What you and I do in this life
carries over into heaven and eternity. That’s what makes this life on earth so important. How we
live here will produce a ripple effect that will go on not just in this life but for all of eternity. God
will make sure of that. “For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each
of us may receive what is due us for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad.”
Life on this earth is not fair. You know that’s true, don’t you? Sometimes we receive the
recognition that we deserve for the good that we do, but it doesn’t always work that way, does
it? Sometimes we get no credit for what we do here on this earth. And sometimes we get
blamed for things that we are not guilty of. Life is not fair. But in heaven it will be entirely
different. God does not miss a thing. He will fairly evaluate us, and he will be sure to reward us
for the way that we have lived for him.
That’s what heaven is going to be like. It will be a secure dwelling and a joyous
homecoming and a fair evaluation. That is something to look forward to!
The Effects of Heaven
It is also something to live for. Heaven should have an effect on the way that we face
life here on earth. Paul mentions two effects of heaven. First, heaven produces confidence.
“Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in
the body we are away from the Lord. For we live by faith, not by sight. We are
confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
(2 Cor. 5:6-8 emphasis added)
Life here on this earth is not always pretty. You look at your life sometimes, and it
seems to be just one huge mess. That’s what Paul’s life is like when he writes this letter, but it
doesn’t shake him. Sure he groans just as you and I do. But he faces all of life’s uncertainties
and injustices with confidence. Why? Because he knows that through Jesus Christ the pains of
this life will not have the final say. Jesus Christ through his death and resurrection has won the
battle. The pains of this life are going to be replaced by the security and joys of heaven!
Therefore, we can approach life with a sense of confidence. One poet put it this way:
My knowledge of that life is small;
The eye of faith is dim:
But it’s enough that Christ knows all;
And I shall be with him.
1
Heaven produces confidence. It also provides us with purpose. “So we make it our goal
to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it” (2 Cor. 5:9).
“To please God”—that’s the purpose of our lives. And pleasing God is worth the effort
because God will reward us in heaven for the way that we live for him here on this earth. God
does not miss a thing! He knows everything that we do, and he will make sure that every little
thing that we do here on earth out of love for him will receive its proper reward.
When I think about the idea of pleasing God, I often think of it in one particular way. I
am almost embarrassed to share it with you because it is so simple. This is not some
theologically sophisticated idea that I learned in seminary. But it does express the desire of my
heart. Sometimes I pray like: “God, I hope that at the end of the day—when you think about all
that you have seen me do today—I hope that I’ve brought a smile to your face.”
Sometimes I even go further than that. I say, “God, I hope that at the end of the day you
will look at me and what I’ve done and say, ‘Thanks, Fred, for doing what I wanted you to do.’”
That’s pretty simple, but that is the goal—to please God. Just think about what it will be
like to get to heaven and to stand before the judgment seat of Christ and hear him say to you,
“Well done, good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of your Lord!” (Matt. 25:21, 23). That
will make all the troubles and trials of this life worth it.
Conclusion
In 1968 a man named John Stephen Akhwari went to Mexico City to represent his
country, Tanzania, in the Summer Olympics. He ran the marathon. Less than half way through
the race there was some jockeying for position. Akhwari stumbled and fell. He injured his knee
and dislocated a joint. But he got up and in spite of the pain kept running.
Out of the fifty-seven competitors who finished the race, Akhwari came in last. The
winner completed the twenty-six miles in two hours and twenty minutes. Akhwari limped into a
nearly empty stadium over an hour later.
John Stephen Akhwari was later asked why he kept running. He replied, “My country did
not send me five thousand miles to start the race; they sent me five thousand miles to finish the
race.”
To finish the race! Fix your eyes on the goal. Cherish that hope of heaven. Don’t let
anything distract you—no matter how trying the conflict or terrifying the fear. Make it your goal
to hear God say to you, “Well done, good and faithful servant!”

"One of my favorite stories is the one about a young woman who went off to college and
got so caught up in campus activities that she forgot to communicate with her parents. Perhaps
you remember the story. She finally got around to sending her parents an email.
Dear Mom and Dad,
It has been three months since I left for college. I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to
tell you what’s going on, but when the dormitory caught on fire, I lost my phone.
I was able to jump out of a window, and I’m happy to report that the skull fracture
is pretty well healed by now. I only spent two weeks in the hospital.
An unemployed man in the neighborhood was the one who called the fire
department, and he later visited me at the hospital. Since the dormitory was a complete
loss and I had nowhere to live, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment
with him.
I know how much you have been looking forward to being grandparents, and I’m
happy to tell you that your dreams will soon be fulfilled.
Now that I have your attention, I want to tell you that there was no dormitory fire.
I did not fracture my skull, and I was not in the hospital. I’m not living with a boyfriend,
and I am not pregnant. But I am getting a D in biology, and I hope you’ll keep that in
perspective.
Signed,
Your loving daughter
As many times as I’ve heard that story, every now and then I need to hear it again.
Keeping things in their proper perspective—that’s one of the great challenges of life, isn’t it?
What really is important in life? And what isn’t? How should we view the trials that come our
way? Do you ever make small problems into something more than they really are? Do you
ever lose perspective?
On the one hand, there seems to be a trend in our culture to always look for the negative
things in life. That’s part of human nature, but it is also part of our culture. There are lots of
things that are going wrong: Congress, the Obamacare website, and the Vikings. It’s easy to
feel discouraged when you look at what is going on around us.
On the other hand, sometimes we Christians have the opposite problem when it comes
to keeping perspective. In some Christian circles the idea is promoted that if you are really
trusting in Christ, then you should be one huge smile from beginning to end. I hesitate to say
this, but I do think of one highly publicized preacher. I am not going to mention his name
because some of you probably like him. But whenever I see that smile pasted on his face, I
can’t help but wonder, “Are you for real?”
There is the challenge—keeping perspective!
Our Scripture passage this morning is 2 Corinthians 4:7-18. The section of Paul’s letter
is perhaps the best-known and most encouraging section of the entire letter. Paul looks at his
life and opens up his soul so that we can see his perspective on life’s problems and God’s
power.
Do you remember from our previous studies in 2 Corinthians what Paul is dealing with in
this section of his letter? He summarizes his situation with a little phrase in chapter 7, verse 5:
“Conflicts on the outside, fears within.” When Paul writes this letter to the Corinthians, he has
just recently escaped with his life from a riot in the city of Ephesus. Those are the “conflicts on
the outside.” Internally he is tied up in knots because he’s also got “fears within.” He’s
wondering what is going on in the city of Corinth. He knows that some people there are
questioning his ministry and undermining his leadership. “Conflicts on the outside, fears within.”
Yet Paul also knows that God has been at work in his life and in his ministry, and he
knows that God is still at work in him. So how does he look at all that is going on in his life?
How does he keep the proper perspective on life’s problems and God’s power? Paul gives us a
picture of what it means to be a Christian. “We have this treasure in jars of clay to show that
this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us” (2 Cor. 4:7).
Some of us are so familiar with that Bible verse that we can read it and not give it much
thought. Or perhaps we hear that phrase, “jars of clay,” and we immediately think of the musical
group by that name. We need to slow down! Stop for a moment and think about “treasure in
jars of clay.” Think of it in modern terms. Imagine some diamonds—big diamonds—a handful
of diamonds. You have to put them someplace so that you don’t lose any. Where are you
going to put them? How about storing them in an aluminum can! Store them in a pop can!
That would probably not be a wise idea, would it? Because what happens to aluminum
cans today? The same thing that happened to jars of clay. In the ancient world jars of clay
were dropped and broken. Today aluminum cans get crunched!
That’s the picture that Paul gives of the Christian life. We have “treasure in jars of clay.”
We have “divine diamonds in disposable cans.” Let’s explore that picture of the Christian life a
little further.
Jars of Clay
We’ll start with the “jars of clay” part. In verses 8 and 9, Paul makes four statements
contrasting the “jars” with the “treasure.” Let’s just read about the “jars of clay” aspect. “We are
hard pressed on every side . . .” Life in this world is not easy and carefree. All of us feel
pressure from one thing or another. Paul goes on and says that in this life “we are . . .
perplexed.” There are times when we look at life, and it doesn’t make any sense. There are
times when we think about what God is doing in our lives, and he doesn’t seem to make sense
either. Paul provides another adjective to describe our lives: “We are hard pressed . . . [and]
perplexed . . . [and] persecuted.” Paul is not using a metaphor when he says that. He was
physically abused because of his faith in Christ. Christians throughout the ages have
experienced the same thing. Here in this country our freedom is the rare exception, and that
may not always be true in the future. “We are hard pressed . . . perplexed . . . persecuted . . .
[and] struck down.” Sometimes life gets to be too much and knocks us flat on our faces.
Paul is not finished. He expands on this description in verses 10 through 12. He
describes the Christian’s existence three times in terms of death. But, more importantly, he
draws a parallel between our experience in this world the experience of our Lord. “We always
carry around in our body the death of Jesus, . . . For we who are alive are always being given
over to death for Jesus’ sake, . . . So then, death is at work in us, . . .” (2 Cor. 4:10a, 11a, 12a).
As Christians we should never be surprised at the hardships that we face in this life. We
claim as our Lord someone who was physically nailed to a cross. He is both our Master and our
Model. If he was treated that way, then why should his followers be surprised that we go
through severe difficulties in this life? We shouldn’t be surprised at trials, and we don’t need to
pretend that they are anything but trials. Paul is not hesitant to acknowledge that he has been
hard pressed and perplexed and persecuted and struck down. If the great apostle Paul can feel
free to say that, so can we. There is no need to paste a smile on your face and pretend
otherwise.
One of the things that I appreciate about the Bible the most is its realism. That’s part of
what makes this book come alive and remain relevant. Read the Old Testament book of
Psalms, and feel the emotion of people who write in that book about their suffering. Look at the
lives of Abraham and Joseph and Hannah and Esther in the Old Testament. Read in the New
Testament about Mary and Peter. They all struggled and wrestled with problems in their lives,
and those problems are recorded for us in God’s Word. You and I do not need to be ashamed
that we too are “jars of clay.” Let’s not pretend otherwise.
Treasure
But let’s not stop with being “jars of clay” either. 2 Corinthians 4:7 says, “We have this
treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.”
There are two sides to the Christian life. We are “jars of clay,” but there is also a treasure at
work within us. Verse 7 says that the treasure is the “all-surpassing power” which is from God.
Thank God that he is at work within us even we are at our weakest!
Let’s read verses 8 and 9 again, and this time we will read all that Paul says. “We are
hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not
abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed.” Here is how one paraphrase of the Bible captures
the idea: “We’ve been surrounded and battered by troubles, but we’re not demoralized; we’re
not sure what to do, but we know that God knows what to do; we’ve been spiritually terrorized,
but God hasn’t left our side; we’ve been thrown down, but we haven’t broken” (The Message).
Another paraphrase puts that last line this way: “We may be knocked down but we are never
knocked out!” (The New Testament in Modern English, by J.B. Phillips). Thank God that he is at
work within us even when we are at our weakest!
Paul once again draws a parallel between our experience and that of our Lord’s. “We
always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be
revealed in our body. For we who are alive are always being given over to death for Jesus’
sake, so that his life may also be revealed in our mortal body” (2 Cor. 4:10-11).
In verses 13 through 15, Paul expands even further on the “treasure” aspect of the
Christian life. He talks about how it has a ripple effect. We experience the power of God in our
lives. Our experience with God can then be used to help others. And the end result is that God
receives the honor and praise that he rightfully deserves. “All this is for your benefit, so that the
grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of
God” (2 Cor. 4:15).
We are jars of clay, but we do have a treasure within us through Jesus Christ. We are
weak and insufficient in and of ourselves, but God’s power is at work within us so that we can
face every problem that comes our way.
PAUL’S CONCLUSION
As Paul thinks about what he has experienced in his life and ministry, he comes to a
conclusion.
“Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are
being renewed day by day” (2 Cor. 4:16). Life is hard, and it does take its toll on us. But the
power of God is at work within his children, and he keeps us going. “For our light and
momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all” (2 Cor.
4:17). Paul is not saying that all of the struggles we have in this life are “light and momentary”—
insignificant and not worth troubling ourselves over. No, he is not saying that. What he is saying
is that compared to the joys that will be ours in heaven, our troubles here on this earth are “light
and momentary.” When we get to heaven and look back at life, we will say, “It was worth to live
for God even though it wasn’t always easy. “So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what
is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal” (2 Cor. 4:18).
When I read that verse and think about the idea of fixing our eyes on what is unseen, I
think of the story of Elisha in 2 Kings 6. A foreign king sends out an army to capture the prophet
Elisha. The leaders of the army learn that Elisha and his servant are staying in the city of
Dothan. So they surround the city. When Elisha’s servant sees the army, he is naturally
terrified. They are doomed. The city is surrounded. There is no escape! But Elisha says, “Do
not be afraid. Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” Elisha’s servant
is no dummy! He can do the math. It’s Elisha and the servant against an entire army! Two
against a whole army! Then Elisha prays, “Open my servant’s eyes, Lord, so that he may see.”
God answers that prayer. Elisha’s servant sees not just the physical but also the spiritual.
There is an angelic army surrounding the city! That army of angels then proceeds to defeat the
soldiers on the ground.
“Therefore we do not lose heart. . . . So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what
is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.”
Just this week we received a letter in the mail from a woman who attended our church
years ago and who now serves with International Messengers. She mentioned a trip that she
had recently taken to Russia to lead an evangelistic English language camp there. One of the
exercises she had her students work on was to read the words of the song, “Unredeemed,” by
the musical group, Selah. Berta and I didn’t know that song, so we checked it out on YouTube.
You know how YouTube works. You watch one video, and then you watch another one.
We eventually came to a video that featured Angie Smith. Angie’s husband, Todd, is the lead
singer for the Selah. Angie told the story of how they had been expecting a child, but during a
routine ultra-sound they learned that their baby girl had some issues that were not compatible
with life. The doctor was straightforward with them. He told them that the baby would either die
in the womb, or she would die just a few minutes after she was born. Then the doctor said that
he knew how devastating this news must be, so he asked her how she was doing. The shock
was overwhelming, but she responded by saying, “I think that Jesus is the same now as he was
before I walked in the door.” She kept saying that to herself over and over again. “Jesus is the
same now. His love for me hasn’t changed. I can still trust him.” She fixed her eyes not on
what she saw and heard, but on what she knew to be true about God.
Their little girl was born, and she did die just a few minutes later. Angie started a blog
just to keep her family and friends up to date on all that was happening. To her surprise that
blog turned into a ministry as other women wrote to her and told their stories. There was that
ripple effect that Paul describes in verse 15. Now Angie’s story and her blog have turned into a
book titled I Will Carry You.
1 God continues to do his work.
“We have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from
God and not from us.”
We need to keep perspective. We do not pretend. We don’t need to hide our hurts and
our disappointments. We don’t need to pretend that we are anything but what we are. We don’t
need to portray ourselves as anything but “jars of clay.”
But let’s also remember that we do have a “treasure” that is at work within us. The
power of God works in our weaknesses. That’s what’s Paul is talking about in this passage.
God can take our most devastating and heartrending tragedies and bring us through them. He
can use them to bring hope to other people and glory to himself. “Do not lose heart. . . . Fix
your eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen.”
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",10/27/2013,
"This morning we are going to think about some basic principles of how Christian ministry
should be conducted. Some of us here today work in ministries such as Oak Hills Christian
College or Mokahum Ministry Center, or we’re involved in ministries like InterVarsity Christian
Fellowship or the Northwoods Pregnancy Care Center. Those of us who are not in ministries
like that—well, you may not get much out of this sermon. But I hope you’ll listen anyway.
Wrong! Wrong! Wrong!
Every one of us who is a believer in Jesus Christ is involved in Christian ministry. Your
ministry may not have an official name, but if you’re a follower of Jesus Christ, then you do have
a ministry. Make no mistake about that. Each one of us who is a Christian represents Jesus to
the people that we live with. That’s a high calling! People will make decisions about our Lord
based on what they see in us and learn from us. What a privilege you and I have to be servants
and representatives of Christ! So let’s get this straight right at the beginning of this sermon:
The principles of ministry that we look at today apply to you!
We find these principles spelled out for us in 2 Corinthians 4:1-6. As we have seen in
our previous studies of this New Testament letter, the apostle Paul starts writing about Christian
ministry in chapter 2 verse 14, and he continues on the subject all the way through to chapter 7
verse 4. He devotes four chapters to this subject. Why? Because Paul’s own ministry is being
challenged. He uses a little phrase in chapter 7 verse 5 to summarize what he’s facing.
“Conflicts on the outside, fears within.” In other words, Paul’s got problems. Big problems! He
had to escape from Ephesus because his ministry provoked a riot in that city. His leadership is
being undermined in the church in Corinth. Those kinds of “conflicts on the outside and fears
within” would make any of us reconsider what it is that we’re doing. In these six verses Paul
lays out for us four factors that drive his ministry and that should direct our ministries as well.
The Source of Ministry
Let’s begin by taking note of the source of Christian ministry. “Therefore, since through
God’s mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart” (2 Cor. 4:1 emphasis added). Ministry
is a product of God’s mercy. It does not come about because of our ambition or skill. In other
words, none of us deserve to represent Jesus to others. But God has chosen us to be his
representatives to other people.
That should do two things for us. First, it should amaze us. Why are you and I given the
privilege of representing the King of kings and the Lord of lords to other people? We don’t
deserve that honor. But God has chosen to pour out his love on us and to forgive all of our sins
and then to appoint us to serve him before a watching world. Isn’t that amazing?
I think of Billy Graham. Next month he will be celebrating his ninety-fifth birthday. I
realize that some of us who are younger don’t know much if anything about Billy Graham, but
for many of us he has been the most prominent evangelist of our lifetimes. I think of an
interview with him that I heard years ago. Someone asked him, “Why do you think that God
chose you to have such a worldwide ministry?” I remember Billy Graham’s response so well.
He said, “When I get to heaven, that’s going to be the first question that I ask God.” Billy
Graham knew that his ministry was not something that he deserved. It was a gift!
That’s the way that it is for all of us. All of us should be amazed to think that the living
God of the universe—the Creator of the heavens and the earth—has appointed us to serve him.
That fact should amaze us, and it should also encourage us. Look again at what Paul
says. “Since through God’s mercy we have this ministry, we do not lose heart” (emphasis
added). Whether our ministries are wildly successful and attention-getting or small and easily
overlooked, they are still gifts from God. And that’s what counts.
Working in our church nursery is a ministry. Most people probably don’t consider it to be
one of the more thrilling forms of Christian ministry. I can’t imagine someone writing a
bestselling Christian biography titled Fifty Years in the Church Nursery. That isn’t going to
happen. But if God has placed you there, give thanks that you get to serve him in the nursery.
Perhaps you are at an age where all you can do is support the church through your prayers.
Thank God for that ministry! We need your prayers!
Do not lose heart! Do not be discouraged! Every ministry is a gift from God. Do not
minimize the importance of what God is calling you to do.
The Method of Ministry
Let’s think about a second factor that drives Christian ministry. Look at what he says
about the method of ministry. He starts with a negative. “Rather, we have renounced secret
and shameful ways; we do not use deception, nor do we distort the word of God” (2 Cor. 4:2a).
Stop and think about why Paul mentions that. Even in the first century there were
people who used religion as a way to take advantage of others. Even two thousand years ago
that was true! There have always been religious charlatans and imposters. That’s why moral
character has always been an essential part of Christian ministry. “We have renounced secret
and shameful ways; we do not use deception.”
You and I need to take stock of who we are and how we are living. Do you want to be
effective as a representative of Jesus? Are you the same person outside of church as you are
inside the church? Do you act one way when you are with Christians and a different way when
you are with your non-Christian friends? Representing Jesus means a lot more than just
knowing the lingo and looking the part. What is the condition of your heart?
That’s the negative. Paul goes on in verse 2 to state the positive. “On the contrary, by
setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of
God” (2 Cor. 4:2b). We renounce deception, and we refuse to distort the word of God. Instead,
we “set forth the truth.”
When you are interested in reaching other people with the good news of Jesus Christ, there
is always the temptation to minimize or play down aspects of the Christian truth that people may
not find to be appealing. For example, the Bible teaches us that God is both loving and holy. He
is not more holy than he is loving, and he is not more loving than he is holy. God is simultaneously
loving and holy. We see that most clearly in God’s greatest act of intervention in human history—
the crucifixion of Jesus. Why did Jesus die on the cross? Because God is holy, and sin deserves
to be punished. Why did Jesus die on the cross? Because God is loving, and he sent Son to take
the punishment that we deserve for our sins. Holiness and love. Love and holiness.
When I think about the general way that the gospel of Jesus Christ is presented today—
and please keep in mind that this is just one person’s observation, it seems to me that God’s
love is often emphasized at the expense of God’s holiness. The result is that non-Christians
have heard so often about how God loves them that they take it for granted. “God loves me?
Of course, that’s his job! What else is new?”
Maybe we need to start not with “God loves you,” but with a question. “Have you ever
considered whether you really deserve God’s love?” That might get people’s attention! And
then we would quickly add, “I have often thought about that, and I know that I don’t deserve
God’s love.” Then let that sink in for a few minutes. Then we would go on, “God did not have to
send Jesus here to this earth for us. He was under no obligation to love us, but he decided to
love us anyway. Isn’t that amazing?”
Think about that approach. Please come up with something better if you can. Let’s be
sure that we don’t distort the good news of Jesus. Let’s be sure that we “set forth the truth.”
The Rejection of Ministry
That leads to a third factor in Christian ministry. We read about it in verses 3 and 4.
“And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. The god of this age has
blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the
glory of Christ, who is the image of God” (2 Cor. 4:3-4). In those verses Paul is acknowledging
what I would call the rejection of ministry.
Perhaps that is putting it too strongly. But I do want to put it forcefully. Today the church
of Jesus Christ comes in for a lot of criticism. We are criticized for being too legalistic or too
judgmental or too rich or too exclusive or too intolerant. That kind of criticism comes not just
from outside the church but from within the church too. There is some truth to all of those
criticisms. Let’s admit that. But there is an unstated assumption that often runs through those
criticisms. The unstated assumption is that if we could just be better at doing everything nonChristians
think the church should do, then people would come flocking to Jesus.
That’s not true. The root problem is not that the church is so bad, but that sin is so
deceptive. That’s what Paul is talking about in verse 3. “The god of this age has blinded the
minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel that displays the glory of
Christ.” The problem is deception. Sin deceives. That is what sin does. It deceives people.
You see that in other people, but we know it from our own experience too. We can all
look back at things that we have done that at the time seemed so good and right. But now we
look back at those things and think, “How could I have been so blind?”
That’s what sin does. So when your friends and family members reject the message of
how they can be forgiven and experience the love of God in Christ, don’t be surprised. Don’t
blame yourself that you must have done something wrong in telling that friend about your Lord.
Just keep on praying. “God, my friend is blind. Once I was blind to your truth and your love too.
You opened my eyes. Open her eyes too, Lord. Please God open his eyes to your Son Jesus!”
The Focus of Ministry
That brings us to the fourth element that is a driving force in Christian ministry. In verses
5-6, Paul stresses the focus of ministry. “For what we preach is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ
as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake. For God, who said, ‘Let light shine out
of darkness,’ made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s
glory displayed in the face of Christ” (2 Cor. 4:5-6).
It’s verse 5 that I want us to concentrate on. “For what we preach is not ourselves, but
Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.” We preach Jesus Christ.
He is the focus of all that we do!
I doubt that any of us here today would disagree with that statement, but it is so easy to
be distracted. There are so many things that can distract us from Jesus. And those distractions
come not from bad things. So often we get distracted by good things.
I want to share with you one thing that I think distracts us today. I’ve thought about this
for years, but just a couple of weeks ago it came to me again. For all the years that I’ve been a
pastor, I have heard about the importance of shaping your ministry around the people that you
are trying to reach. For example, if you are trying to reach people in China with the message of
Jesus, then it would be a good idea if you learned about Chinese culture and learned to speak
Chinese. That makes sense, doesn’t it?
That applies here in the U.S. too. If you are trying to reach a certain group of people
here in our country, then you need to take some time to understand their subculture. What kind
of music do they like? How do they communicate with each other? What kind of technology are
they comfortable with? Those are good and appropriate questions!
But I’ve been to enough conferences and read enough articles along those lines that I’ve
come to the conclusion that we have overdone it. Please understand me. I’m not saying it’s
wrong. In fact, I would say that analyzing the demographics of different generations is good, but
we can overdo it. This week I found a chart that breaks down our culture into different
generations and explains the characteristics of each generation. If you were born between
1901 and 1945, you are part of the Greatest Generation. That generation was followed by the
Baby Boomers, who were born between 1946 and 1964. Then came Generation X made up of
people born between 1965 and 1985. But wait a minute! Generation X can be divided into the
Baby Busters and the Boomerang Generation. Then came Generation Y, which is also known
as Millennials or Echo Boomers. That brings us to people born between 1995 and 2007 who
are Generation Z, and they have their own set of characteristics. Let me say again that I am not
against this kind of demographic study, but I think that it can distract us.
A couple of weeks ago I was at a pastors conference down at our Free Church camp in
Motley, and I heard about a ministry that a megachurch in the Twin Cities started. It is a ministry
geared for Generation Z, and the pastor said that in that ministry he is very careful not to wear a
watch. Why? Because members of Generation Z don’t wear watches. They use their phones to
check on what time it is. So if you want to minister to Generation Z, don’t wear a watch. I have to
tell you that when he said that, I felt really bad. I don’t just wear a watch. I wear a coat and tie.
The next morning I had breakfast with a young pastor, and I asked him about what the
megachurch pastor from the previous night had said about wearing a watch. He replied, “Oh,
that doesn’t do anything for me. Our generation is the generation that values authenticity. I find
no credibility in some sixty-year-old guy wearing skinny jeans!”
Later on I thought about that young pastor’s comment: “Our generation is the generation
that values authenticity.” What generation doesn’t value authenticity? Let’s do a quick survey
right here. How many of you are attracted to people who come across as fake?
My point is that we can be distracted by good things like demographics. We can get
distracted from what is truly essential. I’ve come to the conclusion that there are really two
things essential to Christian ministry. Do you care about people? Do you talk about Jesus?
Isn’t that what Paul is talking about in verse 5? We preach “Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves
as your servants for Jesus’ sake.”
Do you care about people? Do you take time to get to know them? Do you listen to
them and learn about their fears and hopes? That works with every generation. I’ve seen Baby
Boomers effectively minister to Generation Z. They don’t have tattoos, and they have no idea
how to send a text message. But they care. That will overcome any generational barrier.
Do you care about people? Do you talk about Jesus? Tell others how you came to faith
in Jesus Christ. Personal stories about God always communicate. Tell them about the trials that
he has brought your through. Tell them about what Jesus means to you now. They will listen.
Conclusion
If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, God in his mercy has given you a ministry. Don’t
neglect it. Care about people, and talk about Jesus.",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",10/20/2013,
"Do you ever get discouraged? That’s a silly question, isn’t it? We all get discouraged at
various times. That’s just part of life here on this earth.
I’m talking about a particular kind of discouragement. Do you ever get tired of being
you? I get tired of being Fred sometimes. I let a friend down by not carrying through on what I
said I was going to do, or I carelessly say something that hurts another person. Or I pass up
some opportunity to share my faith in Jesus with another person. But then I tell myself that I am
going to work really hard not to make that kind of mistake again. For a while I’m pretty good at
keeping that commitment, but then I do it all over again. It’s so discouraging. I feel like such a
failure. Do you understand what I am talking about? If you’re like me, you start to wonder if you
are just plain hopeless.
Sometimes the idea of becoming a hermit and living way off in the woods all by myself
sounds really tempting. I might not do anything out there to make the world a better place or to
advance God’s kingdom, but at least I wouldn’t hurt anybody! Do you understand what I am
talking about?
I find it encouraging to realize that I’m not the only person who has ever felt that way. In
fact, the great and famous apostle Paul sometimes struggled with those same feelings. We
catch a glimpse of Paul’s self-doubts in our Scripture passage this morning. Look at what Paul
says about himself in 2 Corinthians 2:12-13.
12 Now when I went to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ and found that the
Lord had opened a door for me,
13
I still had no peace of mind, because I did not find my
brother Titus there. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.
It is easy to read those Bible verses and not catch all that is in them. There is some
strong emotion behind Paul’s words. We need to take some time to understand what Paul is
feeling during these events that he is telling us about.
Paul writes this letter to the Christians living the Greek city of Corinth. There is a
problem in that church, and the problem is Paul! Some people in the church don’t trust him.
They think that he is not reliable. He can’t be counted on. So his leadership among the
Christians in Corinth is gradually being undermined, and the value of his ministry is being
questioned.
Paul tries to do something about that. He sails 250 miles across the Aegean Sea from
Ephesus over to Corinth in order to solve the problem, but he is not successful. In 2 Corinthians
2:1, he describes that experience as a “painful visit.” It does not accomplish what he hopes for.
So he leaves Corinth and sails back to Ephesus. But he knows that the problem still needs to
be resolved. What’s he going to do? Should he pay another visit to Corinth? That doesn’t
seem to be a good idea, so after a while he decides to write a letter to the Corinthians. His
trusted coworker, Titus, takes that letter, sails across the Aegean Sea, and delivers it to the
Corinthians.
In the meantime Paul stays in Ephesus. Acts 19 tells us what happens while he is
waiting to hear back from Titus. A riot breaks out! Just what Paul needed! In some ways it is
good news. The message of Jesus has made an impact on the people in Ephesus. That’s good
news, isn’t it? But the craftsmen, who make statues of the Greek goddess who is worshipped in
Ephesus, are upset with Paul, and they want to kill him because his ministry is cutting into their
business. That’s not such good news. So Paul has to escape from the city. He heads up north
to the coastal city of Troas.
While Paul is in Troas, he does two things. First, he encourages the people of the city to
trust in Christ for the forgiveness of their sins, and the people respond. Praise God! The
second thing that Paul does there is to look for Titus. He wants to know what happened when
Titus delivered that letter to the Corinthians. He knows that Titus will not be able to take a ship
straight back to Ephesus because the sailing season for the year is over. It’s too dangerous to
travel by sea in the fall. Titus will have to take the 900 mile land route around the Aegean Sea.
Sooner or later he will come to Troas. But Paul can’t stand the wait! Even though “the Lord had
opened a door” for his ministry in Troas, Paul feels like he can’t wait any longer. So he takes off
for Macedonia to find Titus. Do you get the picture of what is going on?
Paul does eventually meet up with Titus. But he doesn’t provide us with that information
in chapter 2. Paul picks up the story of his travels in chapter 7, verse 5. From chapter 2, verse
14 all the way to chapter 7, verse 5, Paul takes off on a long digression. There is a reason for
that, and we’ll come back to it in just a moment. First, look at what Paul says in chapter 7, verse
5. Notice particularly how he describes his emotions. “For when we came into Macedonia, we
had no rest, but we were harassed at every turn—conflicts on the outside, fears within.”
Can you feel what is going on inside of Paul during all of this time? “Conflicts on the
outside”—like a riot in Ephesus! “Fears within”—what is happening in the church in Corinth?
Paul’s stomach is tied in knots! Even though he is having great success in Troas in bringing
people to faith in Christ, his heart is not fully engaged. He can’t stay any longer in Troas
because he’s preoccupied with Corinth. . Paul has been working with the Corinthians for
almost five years! Now he is wondering. Was it worth it? Maybe it was all a waste! Maybe he
didn’t really accomplish anything at all! Maybe he should just go back to his hometown of
Tarsus and become a hermit! Why not? It sure doesn’t look like he has accomplished anything
worthwhile for God in Corinth!
We need to resist the tendency to think of Christians whom we admire as people who
never wrestle with doubt and discouragement. They are not any different from us. Sometimes
you and I wonder if we can accomplish anything worthwhile for God. We try to share our faith in
Jesus with our family members and our friends. They don’t always respond with enthusiasm or
sometimes even any interest. Sometimes they get angry that we would dare bring up the
subject of God! We parents try to raise our children for Christ, but then some of us wonder why
they haven’t responded to the God who means so much to us. The doubts and the
discouragements creep in and eat away at us. You have felt them, haven’t you? We don’t
seem to be accomplishing much for God. So why try any longer? Let’s just retreat into our own
little worlds and play it safe.
Paul feels that too. “Conflicts on the outside, fears within.” And in this long digression
that runs from 2 Corinthians 2:14 all the way through 7:4—that’s almost four chapters!—he
explains why he is not going to give up even though he is tempted to do so. In this passage he
teaches you and me that we can accomplish something worthwhile for God.
Remember the Goal of the Christian Life
First, we like Paul need to remember the goal of the Christian life. It is a worthwhile and
eternal goal. Look at how Paul explains it.
14 But thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ’s triumphal
procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere.
15 For
we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and
those who are perishing.
16 To the one we are an aroma that brings death; to the other,
an aroma that brings life. (2 Cor. 2:14-16a)
Paul is using a picture in those verses that would have communicated more powerfully
to the people of the 1
st
century than it does us today. When a Roman general was victorious in
battle, he was given permission to have a triumphal procession through the streets of Rome. At
the front of the parade are the victorious soldiers who are cheered by the people standing along
the streets, but at the end of the parade are the captives from the conquered army. Paul
momentarily sees himself as one who has been graciously captured by the Christ. That’s part
of the picture, but Paul doesn’t spend a lot of time on that. He quickly moves to another
element of the triumphal procession. All along the parade incense is burned as part of the
celebration. Imagine the smell of hotdogs on a grill at the 4
th
of July parade here in Bemidji. In
ancient Rome it is incense being burned. For the victorious soldiers the fragrant incense adds
to the fun, but the captives at the end of the parade smell it too. For them it is the smell of death
because they know that when the triumphal procession is over they will be executed.
Paul takes that 1
st
century picture and uses it to portray the goal of the Christian life. We
are God’s incense in this world. “For we are to God the pleasing aroma of Christ among those
who are being saved and those who are perishing. To the one we are an aroma that brings
death; to the other, an aroma that brings life” (2 Cor. 2:15-16a). God has given us an important
task. We are the aroma of Christ in this world.
Let me put it in another way—one that you will remember: For the believer in Jesus the
goal of life is to be a smelly Christian!
That’s what Paul is saying! Don’t cover your faith up with some kind of spiritual
deodorant so that no one can sense that you are a believer in Christ. You are supposed to
smell! You are supposed to smell so strongly that no one can be around you for long and miss
the odor! Everybody who has contact with you should sooner or later notice the smell of Jesus
on you. They should know that Jesus has made a difference in your life. To put it another way,
God wants you to absolutely reek of Jesus!
The point is that you and I play an important role in God’s work here on this earth. We
are the “aroma of Christ.” Therefore, we cannot turn back. We cannot hide away as hermits
even though sometimes we’d like to do that. Whether we are successful or whether we fail, we
have to continue to work toward being the people that God wants us to be. We have to
continue to bring the message of Jesus to everybody we know. That’s the goal of the Christian
life.
That leads Paul to ask a searching question. We find it at the end of verse 16. “And
who is equal to such a task?” If people are going to make a decision about spiritual life or
spiritual death based on what they see in us, are we equal or sufficient or competent to fulfill
that sacred responsibility? How many of us want to raise our hands and say, “Oh, sure I can do
that, God. No problem. Put people’s eternal destinies into my hands, God. Sure! I can handle
it!” Are any of us so daring and arrogant to think that way about ourselves? “Who is equal to
such a solemn task?”
Rely upon the God Who Makes you Competent for the Christian Life
Paul immediately dismisses two kinds of people. In verse 17 he disqualifies those who
think of Christian life as way to get rich. They are not equal to the task. Then in verses 1
through 3 of chapter 3, he goes on to disqualify those who think that because they are wellrecognized
or popular they can accomplish God’s will here on this earth. There is something
more crucial than money and public recognition.
In verses 4 through 6 of chapter 3, Paul tells where our sufficiency or competence for
such an important role in God’s work comes from. We need to rely upon God who alone can
make us competent and sufficient for the Christian life.
4 Such confidence we have through Christ before God.
5 Not that we are
competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our competence comes from
God.
6 He has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant . . . (2 Cor. 3:4-6a)
God is the One who makes us equal to this great mission that he has given to us. You and I
need to remember that when we are tempted to think that we cannot accomplish anything
worthwhile for God. We can rely on God himself, and he will give us the competency and
sufficiency that we need.
Robert Morrison was a missionary in China. When he first sailed there, the owner of the
ship that he was on was amused at the thought that anybody was even thinking of going to the
millions of Chinese in hopes of bringing them to faith in Jesus Christ. “So, Mr. Morrison,” he
said, “you really expect that you will make an impression on the idolatry of the great Chinese
Empire?” Morrison replied, “No, sir, but I expect that God will.” “Such confidence we have
through Christ before God.”
The story is told of a man who went to see the famous evangelist Dwight L. Moody. He
listened to Moody preach about Jesus and the new life that is available through him. Then he
watched as people responded to that message. They came forward and entrusted their life to
Christ and received the forgiveness of their sins. Afterwards this man came up to Moody and
said to him, “This work has to be of God, for I can see absolutely no connection between you
and what I see happening here.”
1 That wasn’t exactly a compliment, but I doubt that Moody was
offended by it. “Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but our
competence comes from God.”
Two weeks ago we held a memorial service here in our church. It was for John
Goodrich. Some of you knew John. Many of you didn’t. I did not know John well. I only knew
him late in his life. He lived to be 98. John was not an impressive man. There wasn’t anything
physically that made him stand out. In terms of his personality he was mild-mannered. I never
heard him speak publicly, but I doubt that he was a forceful speaker. He never struck me as an
inspirational preacher or a charismatic preacher. But at that memorial service we heard so
many people talk about the impact he had made in their lives. We learned about his ministry
here in Minnesota and in Canada and in Brazil and in the Philippines and in Puerto Rico. “He
has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant . . .”
Conclusion
That’s true for you and me too. When we are tempted to give up and become hermits—
when we are filled with self-doubt about our ability to accomplish anything worthwhile for God,
we need to remember what Paul learned in his own life: Don’t ever stop being a smelly
Christian! God will use you for his purposes and his glory. “Such confidence we have through
Christ before God. Not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves, but
our competence comes from God.”",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",10/6/2013,
"This week I have found myself thinking about a man who is mentioned in the Old Testament. I
have never thought about him much before. His name is Asaph. I mentioned him in my sermon last
week, and this week I became somewhat intrigued by him. Asaph lived 3000 years ago when David
was the king of Israel. He was one of David’s chief musicians. His job was to lead the people of Israel
in the worship of the living God. In that role Asaph wrote poems or songs for the people to use in their
worship. Twelve of his poems are included in the Old Testament book of Psalms. No one except
David himself wrote more of the Psalms than Asaph. It is safe to conclude that Asaph was one of the
most prominent spiritual leaders in the city of Jerusalem during the reign of the great King David.
What I find particularly intriguing about Asaph is his humility. Even though he is one of the most
prominent spiritual leaders among the people of God, he is not afraid to admit his struggles. Two of his
poems are intensely personal. As we saw last week, in Psalm 73 Asaph describes his battle with envy.
This morning we’re going to look at Psalm 77 where Asaph candidly shares with us his battle with
doubt. In this poem he doesn’t tell us exactly what happened to him that made him doubt God, but
something catastrophic must have taken place. Asaph has gone through a time of intense suffering.
His openness about that suffering is what makes Psalm 77 so valuable.
I think of some advice that a British preacher named Joseph Parker once passed along to other
ministers. He said, ""Preach to the suffering, and you will never lack a congregation. There is a broken
heart in every pew.""
1
There is a broken heart in every pew. I know the heartache that some of you are feeling
because you have shared those trials with me. But for every burden that I am aware of, I know that
there are ten or twenty that I know nothing about. Some of us are tied in knots over our children and
the choices that they are making. Some of us look at our marriages and wonder if they will always be
so routine and stale. Perhaps some of us are facing uncertainty about our health. Maybe we've just
gone through some financial reversals, or we're wondering whether we have any security in our jobs.
For some of us our hopes are slowly dying. For years we've been quietly nurturing certain expectations
and dreams, but now we've come to realize that they will never materialize. And we wonder: Does
God care? Will he give us the hope and comfort we need?
Part of the good news that the Bible brings to us is that it's OK to have questions and doubts.
We Christians cannot always discern how God is working all things out for good. On the contrary,
sometimes we are almost consumed by our misgivings. And that's OK.
In Psalm 77 we see Asaph trying to fit his experience in life together with his knowledge of God,
and he's having a hard time doing it. This psalm divides neatly into two parts. In verses 1 through 9,
Asaph expresses his doubts. Then in verses 10 through 20 he finds the assurance that he longs for.
Doubts
Think about his doubts first, and see if you can identify with what Asaph is feeling as he
expresses his doubts.
1
I cried out to God for help;
I cried out to God to hear me.
2When I was in distress, I sought the Lord;
at night I stretched out untiring hands
and I would not be comforted. (Psalm 77:1-2)
Those last words catch us off guard. We expect Asaph to say that he prayed and then he was
comforted. Instead he says, ""I would not be comforted.""
 The next line is even more surprising. ""I remembered you, O God, and I rejoiced!"" No, he says,
""I remembered you, O God, and I groaned."" That's the most painful statement in the entire psalm. ""I
thought about you, God. You're the one that is supposed to give me some comfort. Thinking about
your love should have provided me with some kind of solace or consolation. But instead when I
remembered you, it only added to my grief.""
3
I remembered you, O God, and I groaned.
I meditated, and my spirit grew faint.
4
you kept my eyes from closing;
I was too troubled to speak. (Psalm 77:3-4)
Asaph can't get to sleep at night. His despair is so all-encompassing that words to describe the grief
can't be found.
5
I thought about the former days,
the years of long ago;
6
I remembered my songs in the night.
My heart meditated and my spirit asked: (Psalm 77:5-6)
When Asaph compares his present situation to what he once experienced, questions flood into his mind.
7
""Will the Lord reject us forever?
Will he never show his favor again?
8 Has his unfailing love vanished forever? (Psalm 77:7-8a)
Do you sense the irony in that question? Has God's unfailing love failed? The questions keep coming.
Has his promise failed for all time?
9 Has God forgotten to be merciful?
Has he in anger withheld his compassion? (Psalm 77:8b-9)
That last question reveals our most troubling fear. ""Is God angry at me? Is that the reason why these
things have happened? What is it? What did I do that was so bad that God would punish me in this way?""
Can you identify with Asaph’s doubts and fears? It's OK to have doubts. It's OK to wonder out
loud why things happen that seem so contradictory to God's love and care. Sometimes we Christians
are under the false impression that we shouldn't say things like this. ""You shouldn't question God! It's
wrong to have doubts! Don't say things like that about God!"" We don't need to be ashamed of our
doubts. That doesn't necessarily mean that we should parade them before everyone that we run into.
We don't want to become one of those people who can talk about nothing other than their problems.
But neither should we suppress all of our doubts thinking that a smiling face is the sure sign of spiritual
maturity.
Suppressing your doubts is actually a symptom of spiritual weakness. Genuine faith brings its
doubts out into the open and faces them head-on. Instead of hiding those doubts and pretending that
they don't exist, faith prepares itself to wrestle with them. We can talk about them with others, and we
can express them to God himself. In fact, I encourage you when you are going through hard times to
voice your questions to God. God wants you to tell him what is really on your heart. Be honest—
brutally honest—with God.
Assurance
Be sure then to move on the way Asaph does. In verse 10 we see a change. Asaph moves
from expressing his doubts to resolving those doubts and finding the assurance that he longs for. This is
what we need to concentrate on. How does Asaph find that assurance of God’s love and care for him?
10Then I thought, ""To this I will appeal;
the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand.""
11
I will remember the deeds of the Lord;
yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.
12
I will consider all your works
and meditate on all your mighty deeds. (Psalm 77:10-12)
Notice what's going on here. As strange as it sounds, Asaph is giving himself a history lesson. He
thinks about God and what God has done in the past.
13Your ways, O God, are holy
what god is as great as our God?
14You are the God who performs miracles;
you display your power among the peoples.
15With your mighty arm you redeemed your people,
the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. (Psalm 77:13-15)
Asaph goes all the way back to the founders of the nation of Israel, Jacob and Joseph. Then he
turns his attention to the exodus from Egypt and the parting of the waters at the Red Sea.
16The waters saw you, God,
the waters saw you and writhed;
the very depths were convulsed.
17The clouds poured down water,
the heavens resounded with thunder;
your arrows flashed back and forth.
18Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind,
your lightning lit up the world;
the earth trembled and quaked.
19Your path led through the sea,
your way through the mighty waters,
though your footprints were not seen. (Psalm 77:16-19)
It's that last phrase in verse 19 that catches my attention. "". . . though your footprints were not
seen."" I find it fascinating that the writer throws that little comment in there. What do you think he
means by that little phrase? Obviously it's a metaphor. Nobody actually expected to see God's
footprints in the bottom of the Red Sea. But couldn't we say that God's footprints were ""seen"" in that
miracle? If you had been there when the waters of the Red Sea parted—if you had walked through the
Red Sea and seen the waters standing up on both sides of you like walls—wouldn’t you say that you
had seen God? Isn't that the kind of miracle that all of us long for? Wouldn't you say that God had
acted in a miraculous and unmistakable way that no one could deny? Yet the writer says about God, "".
. . your footprints were not seen."" God was there, but even then his presence was not as unmistakable
as it could have been. His footprints were not seen.
How can the example of Asaph help us? Think again about what is going on here. First, take
note of the words of verse 11 again. Asaph does something deliberate. ""I will remember . . . I will
remember . . . I will meditate . . ."" He's making a choice. He is not just enjoying some pleasant
purposeless daydream about the good ol'days. This is not just a faint recollection of some old Sunday
School lesson. It's a deliberate choice. ""I'm going to do something. I'm going to think about something
that may be hard for me, but I'm going to do it."" If we are going to resolve our doubts, we need to make
a choice too.
What should you and I choose to think about? Asaph thinks about the exodus from Egypt. He
chooses to concentrate on God's most decisive intervention in the Old Testament. When did God act
most decisively on our behalf? At the cross! When we are feeling depressed and discouraged, we
need to choose to think once again about Jesus'death on the cross.
But I suspect that some of you are kind of disappointed with that suggestion. Maybe you
wouldn't come right out and say it, but somewhere in the back of your minds was the hope that there
might be a new story to think about. Oh sure, we know the importance of Jesus'death, but we've heard
that story so many times. It's old and familiar. Couldn't God come up with something new and fresh?
Think with me again about Jesus'death on the cross. Have you ever thought of the cross as
another time when God's footprints were not seen? Can you imagine what it must have been like?
What a horrific scene! Even from the perspective of Jesus'enemies, it was brutal. Nailing someone to
a piece of wood and then watching them slowly hang there in agony until hours later he finally died--that
would turn anyone's stomach. Crucifixion was a grisly business. What thoughts went through his
mother's mind and the minds of the women who were with her? ""God, where are you?"" The New
Testament tells us that even Jesus himself had his doubts. He cried out from the cross, ""My God, my
God, why have you forsaken me?"" (Matt. 27:46).
Yet the New Testament tells us that God was indeed at the cross. His footprints were not seen.
His presence was not obvious. But it was at the cross that God was doing his most decisive work.
When Jesus hung upon the cross, it was the time of greatest evil and the time of greatest good! The
New Testament never sugarcoats the cross. Jesus'trial was a sham! His crucifixion was unspeakably
cruel. The sorrow that his mother and his followers felt scorched their souls. There was no comfort to
be found anywhere. Yet in the midst of all that evil, God was at work. He was accomplishing the
salvation of the world. The reason that you and I can have a relationship with God today is because of
what the Father did through his Son that Friday afternoon in Jerusalem.
Will you let that sink in? If God's footprints weren't evident in the greatest miracles of the Old or
New Testament—if his presence was not obvious at the Exodus or at the cross, then should we expect
him to be obvious in the events of our lives either? Of course not. But does that mean that he's not
there when you get discouraging news from the doctor or when you're turned down for that new job?
No. His footprints may not be seen, but God is there doing his work. If you've trusted in Christ as Lord,
he promises to never leave you or forsake you! He doesn't promise to answer all of your questions. He
doesn't promise to explain all of his purposes. But he does promise that he will be with you—yes, even
when his footprints are not seen. Remember the cross. Think about it. Meditate on it.
Look at the final statement of Psalm 77. Look at the conclusion that the writer finally comes to.
20You led your people like a flock
by the hand of Moses and Aaron. (Psalm 77:20)
""You led your people like a flock."" It is a quiet conclusion. We might even be tempted to say that it is
disappointing. The loose ends of life are not now all neatly tied together. It is not as if Asaph now has
resolved his doubts to the point where they have disappeared. There's just a calm assurance. ""You led
your people like a flock.""
In the end that's really what counts. We don't know what this life holds for us. Trials and
hardships will come. We will add to the misery by our choices that are wrong and sinful. There is no
question about those things. But will God still care for us? Will God continue to give us strength to
bring us through trials? Can we count on God to continue to forgive us when we sin against him? Can
we find security in God?
I think of the words of the apostle Paul that are found at the end of Romans 8. He doesn't give
us any false assurances. On the contrary, he tells us that we will have to go through many ordeals. But
he also provides us with assurance.
I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels or demons, neither the present nor the
future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to
separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 8:38-39)
There is our security! Yes, you can trust in God’s loving purposes even when his footprints are
not seen.
",Frederic Martin,"Bemidji, MN",9/1/2013,
"""Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.  For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved: Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption."" -Acts 2:22-27

      I want to speak this morning on the subject, The Determinate Counsel. This by the way, is the sermon Peter preached on Pentecost. It says, ""Him,"" (talking about Jesus being delivered by the determinate counsel. That word, 'determinate', means settling counsel - they were going to settle something) ""by the foreknowledge of God ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain"". I want to speak to you this morning on the Determinate Committee, or the Settling Counsel, if you please.

I told the men in the study a while ago before we came in that I may have a spell while I am preaching this morning and in fact I am about to have now just reading my outline.

There was a time in eternity past when the Eternal Committee met. I do not know exactly who was on that committee. Of course the Heavenly Father was on that committee. Of course his son, Jesus - he was not called his Son then, He was the second listed person in the Godhead - he was on that committee. And of course the Holy Spirit was on that committee. I do not know if Gabriel was there or if Michael was there. I do not know totally who was on it. But the Bible says that there was a Determinate Counsel before the foundation of the world. And this committee had a meeting. And at that meeting they settled a few things. By foreknowledge they looked into the future and saw that man would fall. And then they loved us, loved man, and wanted a plan to reclaim us. So, they settled a few things. Now this morning I want you to notice what they settled.

Let's picture this committee. Are they around the table? I don't know. Are they sitting in a room together? I don't know exactly. Are they meeting on a cloud or a planet? I don't know. But somewhere, before there was ever a world, before there was ever an animal, before there was ever a bird, before there was ever a fish, before there was ever a man, somewhere there was a committee that met called the Determinate Counsel.

Now there are several things. First, they decided that since man was a sinner they had to make a plan whereby they could reclaim man. So this was the plan, and this was the only plan that they could have made, that man had sinned and sin must be paid for. The Bible says that the wages of sin is death. The Bible says that sin when it is finished bringeth forth death. The Bible says that wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned. Somebody has got to pay for sin. Now that price is Hell. Either you pay for it or find somebody to pay for it for you. So, they realized that all of us were sinners and God, through his foreknowledge looked down in the future with His telescope of prophecy and saw that you and I would some day be sinners.

God, as I said a while ago, loved us so much that he did not want us to go to Hell. He did not prepare Hell for us. Hell was prepared for the Devil and his Angels. And if you die and go to Hell you will be an intruder because God never intended for anybody to go to Hell. God is not willing that any should perish that all should come to repentance, the Bible says.

Now then, there must be a plan. Here was the plan. There was nobody in the world who was without sin. This is way back yonder in eternity past and God was looking down and God saw that man was going to sin. So, the plan was that somebody who had never sinned, and would never sin, would come to earth, become a man and live on the earth for 33 years. Never sin. Never say what he shouldn't say. Never go where he shouldn't go. Never hear what he shouldn't hear. Never think what he shouldn't think. Never be what he shouldn't be and never be where he shouldn't be. Never sin. And that only person who never sinned was the Son of God, Himself. And so God became flesh, His name was Jesus Christ. And he came to the Earth and lived a perfect life. And this was all determined by the Determinate Counsel. All determined before there ever was a world. Before the foundation of the world was laid. And they determined it.

And they determined that Jesus Christ would come and live a perfect life. That he would go to the cross and on the cross he would dip his own soul into Hell. And pay a penalty in your place and in my place so that we do not have to pay that penalty.

Now this morning you have one choice of two. And I'm digressing here, but you have one choice of two. Either you pay your own debt or you find somebody who has never sinned to pay it for you. Only one never sinned, and that's Jesus Christ. The Pope has sinned so he can't pay your debt. The priest has sinned, he can't pay your debt. The Archbishop has sinned, he can't pay your debt. And the church has sinned so it can't pay your debt. Nobody can pay your debt unless he is free of sin. So Jesus came, and lived and died, and paid a debt he did not owe so you would have the debt paid for you. Now all you have got to do is by faith, realize you are sinner, that you owe this sin debt, and accept the payment that God has made for you through his Son, and at that moment you become a child of God. Now this plan was made before the foundation of the Earth was laid. Several times you find in the Bible, something happened before the foundation of the Earth.

So this committee met and this committee decided that Jesus would suffer and his blood would be shed and that salvation would be finished. Now all of this was decided before the foundation of the world. Then he comes along and in Hebrews 9:26 it says, Jesus suffered before the foundation of the world. Did he suffer before the foundation of the world? No, he did not suffer Calvary until 2,000 years ago. But when God decides something it is all settled. This was the Settling Committee. This was the committee that settled the matter. When God decides on something it is as good as done. So, in the mind of God, Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world.

Then it says in I Peter 1:20, that his blood was shed before the foundation of the world. Does that mean that he had to shed his blood before the world was created? No, it means in the mind of God that God settled it and when God settles it then it is taken care of. And so in the mind of God his blood was shed before the foundation of the world.

The Bible says in Hebrews 4:3, salvation was finished before the foundation of the world. Does that mean that salvation was finished way back yonder? No, it means that God decided to do it and when God decides to do something it is as good as done. For example: When you make a promise to make a payment on the first of every month, it ought to be that it is as good as done. May I say this? Whenever I go in debt for something my debts are paid before they come due? Why? Because when I make a promise to make a payment the first of every month, I don't make it the second of every month, I make it the first of every month. It is all settled and when I sign that paper it is as good as paid.

Now when God and the Determinate Counsel met before the world was ever created, they decided that Jesus would come. That he would go to the cross. He would shed his blood, he would be buried, he would rise again and salvation would be finished before the foundation of the world.

In that Determinate Counsel, in that Settling Counsel, that looked down and saw that you and I would sin. That Settling Counsel that looked down and saw that you and I were lost. In that Settling Counsel that decided that Jesus would come. In that Settling Counsel that decided that he would shed his blood. In that Settling Counsel that decided that he would rise from the dead after 72 hours. In that Settling Counsel they also decided that all I would have to do was choose to be saved. They decided that I would not have to get baptized to be saved. They decided that I would not have to join the church to be saved. They decided that I would not have to live a good life to be saved. They decided that I would not have to be baptized to be saved. They decided that I would not have to take communion to be saved. They decided that I would not have to take the sacraments to be saved. In the Determinate Counsel it was all settled that all I would have to do is choose to rely on Jesus to take me to Heaven.

You say, ""Brother Hyles, my church doesn't believe that."" I'd rather depend on the Determinate Counsel than your church.

""My denomination says that the Pope can pardon sin."" I'd rather depend on what the Determinate Counsel said. When God the Father and God the Son and God the Holy Spirit met before there was ever a world and decided that all you ever had to do was to understand that you are a sinner, understand that you were lost and owe the debt. Understand that Jesus paid that Jesus paid that debt and trust him and rely on him to take you to Heaven. That was determined back yonder before there was ever a world. So this counsel is meeting still. They are around the eternal table in Heaven. So, it is all settled. Someone on the counsel said, ""We know that Hyles is going to trust Jesus. We can look down there in the future and see that Hyles is going to trust Jesus. We may as well put his name in the Book of Life."" And God looked down and saw me as a little boy almost 11 years of age down in the Ghettos of the southwest part of Dallas, Texas. And God saw me trusting Jesus, and he said, ""Aw shoot, put his name down now."" (Yeah, I am about to have a spell, these microphones may fall like bowling pins, I might make a strike this morning.) I am trying to say, ladies and gentlemen, that this was done by the Determinate Counsel. God the Father, God the Holy Spirit, God the Son met and determined that I was going to get saved as they watched on Heaven's video. And they saw me walking the aisle and they decided to make it possible for me to get saved by faith in Jesus Christ.

Because Jesus had decided to go - so he went before the foundation of the world. He decided to live a perfect life - so he lived a perfect life before the foundation of the world. He decided to die on Calvary - so he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world. He decided to shed his blood - so his blood was shed before the foundation of the world. He decided to be buried and rise again - so he was buried and rose again before the foundation of the world. And he said, ""O.K., so we see that he is going to get saved, go ahead and write his name..."" That means that my name has been written in the Book of Life ever since the Counsel met back yonder. So, my name was entered.

So, this Counsel said, ""See that little boy down yonder? In August, 1937 that little boy, almost 11 years old, is walking the aisle and trusting Jesus as his Saviour. He's going to get saved! Write his name down."" That isn't all. The Bible says in Romans 8 that he is predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son. So God said, ""Let's just make him a perfect body."" And Jesus was at that Counsel and said, ""Father, why don't you make just like the one that I am going to have?"" That means that before there was ever a world God decided to send his Son. His Son decided to come. His Son decided to die. The blood of his Son was all shed. He had been buried and risen. And salvation was completed before there was ever a bird to fly in the air, a fish to swim in the sea or a beast to roam the field. Or a man to live on the earth. Before there was ever a tree grown, before there was ever a weed, before there was ever a flower, before there was ever grass, before there was ever a planet God looked down, and that Counsel met, and they said, ""That boy is going to receive Jesus as his Saviour and we have foreordained that Jesus would come and live and die and rise and that anybody that would choose him can be saved, and that little boy is doing it, so go ahead and write his name down."" But that isn't all, they said, ""Go ahead and get a body ready for him.""

You talk about falling from Grace? You say, ""If you sin, your name won't be in the Book of Life."" My name has been there for eternity.

So, the Counsel decided to put my name in Heaven. The Counsel decide to make my body just like his.

For example, the Counsel is meeting again. They look down in eternity future and see that Jesus said that he would go and live and die. A lamb slain before the foundation of the world, blood shed before the foundation of the world, my name written in Heaven before the foundation of the world, predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son. That means that when you see me in Heaven you'll say, ""Good morning, Jesus.""

And I'll say, ""Hold it, I'm not Jesus.""

And you'll say, ""Well, I'll declare, you look just like him.""

And I'll say to you, ""So do you.""

That means that you'll look like me (you always wanted to look like me haven't you?).

I have already been predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son. So, the committee meets and says, ""Jack is going to trust Jesus, go ahead and write his name in Heaven. May as well make his body now also, no use in waiting until he gets raptured. Let's also go ahead and justify him."" Whom he hath predestinated them he also called, whom he hath called them he also justified. We are not talking about when I got saved, we are talking about way back yonder before there was anything. Not before there was ever a world but before there was ever a foundation laid, a universe. This committee met and said, ""Go ahead and justify him.""

Here is what they said. ""Is it O.K. with you fella's? Go ahead and raise your hand if it is O.K.. It's all settled right? It is all settled that Jesus is going to go, right? He is going to live and die, right? He is going to be raised from the dead, right? Anybody that will trust what he did will get saved, right? And it's not by good works, not by joining the church, not by being baptized, not by taking communion, not by taking the sacraments, it's just by trusting on what Jesus is going to do?"" (Going to do nothing because he has already done it because in the mind of God, God said he would do it).

Listen, this little piddling bunch of people writing new Bibles trying to change what God said. God said it before the foundation of the world! Don't you change what God said back yonder! Don't you change what God said before there was ever a world, bless God, here is what God said right here! I am sick and tired of this Bible of the Month Club! This interesting and I don't understand this - the only folks that can understand the King James Bible are dumb folks like us. All the scholars need a better Bible. And I agree with them. They don't have the Holy Spirit living in them to teach them the Bible and I agree with them.

God said it. Jesus said ""I'll go, good as done. I'll die, good as done. I'll shed my blood, good as done. I'll rise from the dead, good as done. Anybody that trusts me can be saved, good as done. Jack's going to trust me, good as done. His name's going to be written in the book, write it down. He's going to have a body like mine, get it ready. And he is going to be justified!""

To the recording angel he said, ""Look, if Jack ever sins, don't write it down."" That was in the Determinate Counsel. Did you hear what I said? The average person meeting in church this morning has no idea what grace is all about. You couldn't be saved by works because it was settled before you were here. It was settled before you could work.

God looked down and saw that you would trust him and God said, go ahead now and put his name down, and go ahead now and make a body for him and go ahead no and see to it that no sin is charged to his account. That was settled way back yonder. And that was not all, Jesus said to record those sins next to his name instead. To put a note next to Jack's name not to put any sins on his record but to put them on Jesus' record. Why? Because Jesus has already died.

In the mind of God Jesus came before there was ever a world. In the mind of God he lived a perfect life before there was a world. In the mind of God he went to Calvary before there was a world. In the mind of God he was buried before there was a world. In the mind of God he shed his blood before there was a world. In the mind of God he rose again before there was a world. In the mind of God I was saved before there was ever a world. God did not choose me to be saved, I had to choose to do that. But God, having foreknowledge, saw that I would be saved and in the mind of God my name was written in the book before the foundation of the world. In the mind of God my glorified body was already prepared before the foundation of the world. In the mind of God I was justified before the foundation of the world. In the mind of God it was settled that I my sins would not be recorded against me before the foundation of the world. In the mind of God it was settled that my sins would be charged to Jesus. Before the foundation of the world! Well, glory!!

And this committee is still meeting here. ""How many want to vote for Jesus to go? How many want to vote for Jesus to live a perfect life? To die for the sins of all the world? How many want to vote for Jesus to be buried and to rise again? How many want to vote for salvation to be simply by trusting in Jesus?"" ""It's unanimous.""

I've got good news for you, the committee has met. It is unanimous.

See that little boy down there in the ghetto getting saved? Let's get him a body just like Jesus' body. Let's justify him now. Let's decide right now to put beside his name, enter no sins here. And let's decide now to put beside his name, enter sins against Jesus' record. He's going to go to Heaven, let's just go ahead and make his place ready now. Let's get his house ready now. Let's make him a home in Heaven. That's what it says, the kingdom prepared before the foundation of the world.

What a deal. You say, ""If you don't behave you may lose your salvation."" Yeah, you'll lose your salvation, but you won't lose his salvation. His was settled before there was a world. His was settled before there was a foundation of the world and my name was written there, I was glorified, I was justified and God decided to prepare a home for me! That decision was made by the committee, the Determinate Counsel in Heaven. So God said to get it ready.

Did you know that if you trusted Christ as your Saviour, you had to do it because the Bible says whosoever WILL may come. You have to WILL to trust Christ as your Saviour.

Those Pathfinders that sang a while ago, you are just as important to God as anybody. Those mission men and those homeless people and you bus kids and sailors. Did you know if you trusted Christ as your Saviour, that God looked down and saw that you would and before there was ever a world he decided to go ahead and get the whole deal done?

That's what the writer meant when he said, ""The old account was settled long ago."" He did not mean the old account was settled in 1937 when I trusted Christ. He wasn't talking about the old account was settled at Calvary when Jesus died. He was saying the old account was settled in eternity past when God said he will come, it's as good as settled. When God said, he will die, it's as good as settled. When God said he will shed his blood, it's as good as done. When God said he will rise again, it's as good as done. God said since it is as good as done, just do the whole thing now!

And that means that this morning all this can become valid for you, just like that. You say, ""Preacher, who said that I can get saved without getting baptized?"" The Determinate Counsel said it. ""Who said I can get saved without being confirmed?"" The Determinate Counsel said it. ""Who said that I can get saved without having the priest absolve my sins?"" The Determinate Counsel said it. ""Who said that I can get saved without getting baptized or taking the Lord's Supper or the Sacraments?"" The Determinate Counsel said it. Anybody that says that you can get saved by taking the sacraments is totally disregarding the divine Determinate Counsel of Almighty God.

I love this. My mother would say to me when I was a little boy. ""Son, I loved you before you were born. When I heard you were coming I loved you. Before you were ever born I loved you. Before you ever breathed your first breath I loved you. Before I ever saw you, I loved you.""

For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. You say, ""Oh, that means he gave him at Calvary."" No, he gave him before the foundation of the world. And by the way, that means from the time the Determinate Counsel met until the time that Jesus was crucified the Father would look at him and say to himself, ""He's got to die."" You folks who have sat beside little children who have wilted away from an incurable illness. And you've looked at them and said to yourself, they've got to die, they've got to die, they've got to die! I can't stand to look at it!

The Heavenly Father, for thousands of years, knew that Jesus had to go to Calvary every time he looked at him. He who was perfect love, who loved more deeply than anybody could ever love knew that he had to go to Calvary. All that was settled in the Determinate Counsel when the Settling Committee met and decided. That means that all that meeting was decided because God loves you. For God so loved that he gave. And he gave in eternity past. And he said Son, I'll let you go. And at that Determinate Counsel, through his foreknowledge, God looked down and saw that you would trust him if you will. And God put your name in his book. Justified you just as if you never sinned. Prepared your body for eternity just like Jesus' body. Decided not to ever record any sins against your name. Decided to record every sin you commit on the account of Jesus. And decided to prepare you a home in Heaven before the foundation of the world in this Determinate Counsel meeting.

Now listen to me carefully. Don't you let your priest keep you from going to heaven when you die. Don't you let the Pope keep you from going to Heaven when you die. Don't you let anybody or anything like your bottle of liquor or your lust for a licentious life keep you out of Heaven and send your soul to Hell!

All this can be yours. Truck drivers - when you walk out those doors this morning to get in your truck, you can have your name in Heaven. You can be justified. God will put your sins against Jesus and won't record your sins against you. God has a home in Heaven he wants you to claim.

You sailors can go back to your base with your name in Heaven, sins forgiven as God's child. And be redeemed with the blood of Calvary. You can do it this morning! I don't care who you are or how deep in sin you have gone. At that Determinate Counsel, before there was ever a world, it was all settled.

The old account was settled long ago. Long ago, long ago. The old account was settled long ago. And yes it's clear today, for he's washed my sins away.

Jesus paid it all. Where? On Calvary? Yes but in the mind of God it was paid before there was ever a world. Come this morning and claim what's yours.

You say, ""What do I have to do?""

Nothing. It has all been done.

""That seems too easy to me.""

Forget what it seems to you and think what it seems to God. He loves you. He loves you mission man and sailor lad and he loves you truck driver. He loves the Pathfinders and he loves all of us. And he said, ""I loved you so much it was an eternal love before the foundation of the world."" And he'll make you his child this morning and you can go to Heaven when you die.

You say, ""Brother Hyles, what church do I join?""

It doesn't make a flip of difference what church you join, as far as going to Heaven is concerned.

Come every soul by sin oppressed, there's mercy with the Lord, and he will surely give you rest by trusting in his Word.

Only trust him, that's it! When? Now. He will save you. When? Now.

You folks who aren't saved ought to be running down this aisle. I recall one service we had a man in the balcony. I told the plan of salvation he got so happy that about five minutes before I finished my sermon he came running down the aisle and trusted Christ.

I preached in East Texas one Christmas night. An old alcoholic was sitting in the back corner. About five or ten minutes away from the end of my sermon he stood up and yelled, ""Hey reverend, I can't wait no longer!"" And he ran down the aisle and trusted Jesus as his Saviour. Walk the aisle and say yes to Christ.",Jack Hyles,"Hammond, IN",2/27/1997,
"Today, we hear in the readings a lot about what it means to really “see” something for what it truly is.

First we look at our Old Testament reading. The prophet Samuel is charged by God to go to Bethlehem to Jesse’s family, and anoint the new king for Israel. The strong, older, strapping sons of Jesse parade in front of Samuel first:

And [Samuel] consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. When they came, he looked on Eliab and thought, “Surely the Lord’s anointed is before him.”

Eliab looks like a fine example of Israelite manhood. And if we remember our history a bit, Saul was chosen to be king because “there was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he. From his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.” (1 Sam. 9:2) But what happens? The choice from Jesse’s sons was not to be based on an eye-test.

But the Lord said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.”

Not as man sees things is how things truly are. Man looks at the outward appearance of things. But the Lord looks upon the heart of the matter. The Lord sees what is inside, what drives each person. And we too easily forget that we live by faith in what we hear from God, not by sight.

If we view the nature of this world with the eyes of our reason alone, it appears as if men decide matters by themselves, as if God is merely an idol spectator to what people decide to do. But turn to God’s Word, and we see things differently. God from eternity has foreseen everything that occurs in time. God has set the course and goal for everything, and has decided the number of days for each person to live and where and at what point in history that each person lives. It appears to the eye that people begin, continue, and carry out everything according to their own free will. But the truth is, God has all people in His hand, guiding them to carry out His eternal decree. God controls the good, and the evil, by hindering it, setting bounds to it, and sometimes letting it happen in order to carry out His judgments of grace and wrath. (Paraphrased from Walther, Sermons, vol.1, p. 147)

As an example, God eventually allows Saul to be given over to his own wicked will, and eventually his evil ways ran their course to his death, and young, ruddy, shepherd-boy David would become the shepherd-king of all Israel, which was God’s eternal good and gracious will. After all, the Savior and heavenly King of all would come from Judah’s clans, would be born in David’s city of Bethlehem, and would be David’s Son and Lord at the same time.

Now fast forward to the days of our Lord Jesus’ ministry on earth, and the ultimate thing that confronts the disciples of Jesus Christ is that this king and Messiah is not at all what man would see the king and Messiah to be. This Jesus is a stumbling block. How can it be that the Son of Man and Son of David will be glorified by being delivered over to the Gentiles, mocked, shamefully treated, spat upon, flogged, and killed – on the cross? This is weakness and folly to be crucified. Should our king not be handsome, head and shoulders above everyone, desirable to look upon, leading His kingdom to earthly glory?

The disciples are the ones talked about by the prophet Isaiah, they esteem not the suffering Christ, they regard a Crucified Christ as cursed, stricken by God, smitten, and afflicted, His appearance so marred, beyond human semblance, His form beyond that of the children of mankind, no form or majesty that we should look at Him, no beauty that we should desire Him, despised and rejected by men, one from whom men hide their faces. (Is. 52:14, 53:2-3)

The prophets were right long before that the Christ would suffer and die. They had to be because God spoke by these men. And God spoke out loud what He Himself had determined – that the Christ would not suffer accidentally, because His foes desired it, outwitted, and overpowered Him, but because God wanted it, and therefore Christ Himself wanted it. He will be delivered for this death, Jesus says, by God, into the hands of sinful men. It is God’s holy will.

Everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. The promised Son of Man, the seed of the woman promised to fallen man in paradise, would crush the head of the serpent while it would kill Him by a poisonous wound in His heel; pierced for our transgressions, crushed for our iniquities, it was the will of the Lord to crush Him, to put Him to grief, His soul making an offering for guilt, pouring out His soul to the death, bearing the sin of many, making intercession for the transgressors.

The disciples are blind to what Jesus is saying. They are deaf to the Holy Scriptures, to the prophets of old, so they do not truly see. They see things as man sees it, not as God wills it. They look for Saul, and they miss David.

Who and what do you look for? Are you seeing things as sinful man sees it, according to the flesh, always looking for the eye-catching, world-pleasing, glory-receiving “messiahs” that this world offers? Wouldn’t it be easier to shun the cross, and go along to get along with this world and its prince? Is it not easier to go along with and get along with sin in our life, rather than renouncing it and having nothing to do with it, rather than having someone bleed, suffer, and die for those sins?

God is not as man sees Him. God is not some sort of loving, doting, indulgent grandfather, who lets the kids get by with anything. Man sweetly dreams that he sees God as a beautiful, gracious Being whom no one need fear, a Saul, an Eliab. But God gets inside to the heart of the matter, He sees things differently, God really hates your sin, and His wrath burns hot due to your sin down to the lowest hell. Sin is no joke to God, no trifle that He will overlook. Sin is offensive to God’s holiness, and His fiery wrath and fury against sin are a frightful, terrible reality. You want to see God, you see Him as He is in the bloody tragedy on Golgotha, where the only-begotten Son had to atone for the sins of men if you sinners should find grace with God. He is the hard-working, humble, vengeful David who kills Philistine giants and protects the flock from the bears and lions of this world and its prince, and does so by laying down His life, the ransom for the many.

As Jesus makes His way up to Jerusalem, a blind man calls out to Him for mercy. Do not be the disciples, looking as man does for the beauty of Saul. Realize that you need to be the blind beggar, having nothing to offer before Jesus, humbly seeking David’s Son. Our great sin is failing to realize we need what God has ordained to be done. This blind beggar, by grace, through faith in the promises of God, is a man who “sees” that Jesus is the Messiah, the Savior, for he calls Him “Son of David.” He is blind to the ways of the world, but he has ears fully tuned to the Word of God, every Word of which He truly lives and moves and has his true being from. He waits for King David, calls out to Him, and finds mercy there.

You are the blind beggar every single Sunday and upon every festival celebrated here, answering the question of Jesus, “What do you want me to do for you?” Your answer: “Lord, have mercy upon us, Christ, have mercy upon us, Lord, have mercy upon us.” It’s not an idle prayer, just so many words to say at the beginning of the Divine Service. We are putting all our deepest needs before the same Lord who stopped for the blind beggar that day long ago, knowing He inclines His ear to us as well, giving out the wages according to His desire to give, spreading His saving Word with reckless love and abandon to bring you to His harvest, bringing to you blind beggars life and healing from His nail-pierced hand.

“Quinquagesima” is the title for today, meaning that we are fifty days away from the Holy Three Days – the remembrance and celebration of the beating heart of our Christian faith, the saving work of our Lord Jesus Christ in His suffering, death, and resurrection. It is no accident I surmise that the message today is the same one as fifty days after the great Easter feast – Pentecost. Today we hear Jesus will suffer, die, and rise. On Pentecost, Peter will tell us that we crucified the Lord of life, but that the grave could not hold Him. What the apostles and prophets saw and proclaimed, now we believe by faith, taking their Spirit-inspired eye-witness as true and faithful, to be believed and held onto to the end of our days.

All throughout these next days and weeks, from now to Easter to Pentecost, and beyond, with the blind beggar, let us humbly and persistently see things as God sees them, and call upon Christ in faith to open our eyes again in His mercy, that we see again His cross and passion, His precious death and burial. That we see again His blood of the new covenant shed for you for the forgiveness of sins. That we see again His love that is patient and kind, that bears and endures all things and never ends. That we may finally one day experience the power of those blessed words and see our Redeemer who lives, face to face, with our own eyes, and not another, the one who loves us without fail, who says, “See again, your faith has saved you.”",Jacob Sutton,"Terre Haute, IN",2/26/2017,
"In our Gospel reading this morning, we hear the parable of the sower. Jesus himself tells us that the seed is God’s word- it is His revealed will and Truth. The seed falls onto four different types of soil, and Jesus tells us what this means.

The seed that falls on the path is stepped on, and then eaten by the birds, are those who never hear the Gospel nor believe it. The devil, whose name means “deceiver”, snatches the seed away. He spreads false religion and beliefs. Today, he tries to tell you that “science and progression and academia have disproved God. You simply believe in old fairy tales.” He says, “Do you really believe in a God who died on the cross for your sins?”

He will try to fill your head with all sorts of unbelief. He’ll tell you that Jesus was just a great moral teacher, but certainly not a God. Or that all religions are really just the same thing, Christianity is really more of a cultural approach to religion- it doesn’t hold any real Truth. And he works tirelessly to spread these lies because the word of God tells you that Satan has been defeated by God’s victory on the cross. Beware of the deception of Satan- he is cunning, but his words are poison.

The seed that falls on the rocky soil springs up, but then withers away because it has no root. These are those who hear the word with joy, but when their faith is tested they fall away. The Christian life is a journey. Christ tells us, “my yoke is easy and my burden light.” He tells us that the Christian life is the path of joy. And so it is. You are made right with your creator; you reside in the church which gives a wonderful and supportive community. The Christian life has many blessings and wonders.

Yet the Christian life is not always easy. Christ also tells you to “pick up your cross and follow him.” He tells us that the Christian life is one of persecution because the world will hate us just like the world hated him. Don’t be surprised that the world despises what you believe, and they will certainly disagree with and look down on you. You college kids: your professors and your classmates will sneer and laugh at you if you tell them you believe in traditional marriage and that you don’t believe in evolution. Just this past weekend at our college conference at IU, we learned that many science professions, especially in academia, screen for Christians in their hiring process. They don’t want to and they won’t hire Christians.

Many of you have family members and close friends, employers and employees, who will ask you to abandon your moral convictions. Your Christian beliefs may put strain on these relationships. Yet, it could be much worse. If you go to Africa or China, or the Middle East, Christians fear for their life. The truth is that the world will persecute you and test your faith. When these temptations and trials come, do not wither away from the heat and lose hope, remember that this world will fade, and in the end, all that will remain will be the promise of Christ’s victory on the cross, and the place in Heaven he has prepared for you. And remember that he stands by you in your persecution; he will not abandon you- even when times seem tough.

The seed that falls among the thorns are those who hear the gospel but are consumed by the cares, riches, and pleasures of life. Jesus tells us that the seed of God’s word can live for a while among the thorns, but eventually the thorns will choke out the seed. Jesus tells us that we cannot serve 2 masters. If fun with friends, popularity, the next vacation, your career, or your health is more important to you than God’s word. Then your Christian life will be choked out and die.

Do you see the danger? It is so easy in our 21st century lifestyle to simply chase after the next thrill. One may start off going to Church and believing in God. But before they know it, there are more obligations at work, more Saturday night parties, and more vices that go against God’s word –and in the moment, they feel so right. Yet, as the thorns grow, they will choke out any desire you have to God to church, or to hear God’s word. Beware of the temptations of your flesh. It will desire a life of luxury and thrills, and all the while it will make you forget about God, and forget about your need for Him and His word.

Last we have the seed that falls upon the good soil grows and flourishes. If you have ever gardened, you know that a healthy soil does not just happen. Someone has to plow and tend to it consistently. The same is true with you. God will tend to you and His Holy Spirit will keep your faith strong and secure. However, this process isn’t always fun. Just as a Father must sometimes take things away from his son in order to grow him into a healthy man; so it is with God and us. When we pray “Thy will be done,” we trust that God will do in our lives whatever will be best for us and those around us. It may not always be fun, but it is certainly best. The tilling of the soil isn’t always pleasant, but it’s certainly essential. So, we trust in God and know that through Him, all shall be well. And we trust that He comes to you in His word and sacraments.

The truth is that the devil, the world, and your sinful flesh will try to fill your heart and head with things that will make you wither and bear no fruit. But God’s word is good and powerful. God’s word brings you grace. It tells you that by His loving nature, God has planted you, and nourished your soil with the body and blood of His own Son. God’s word and promise of grace and salvation lives in you through the living waters of your baptism. God’s word brings to you the truth that Jesus has conquered the devil, the world, and your sinful nature in His death and resurrection. And because of this, he has promised that you will never wither or die, but will become the heavenly man or woman that He specifically created you to be.

Thanks be to God for the atoning death and resurrection of Christ, and the word which brings that truth to you and me today. Amen",Bryan Stecker,"Terre Haute, IN",2/19/2017,
"“Friend, I am not unrighteous to you. You agreed with me for a denarius, didn’t you? Take up that which is yours and go. For I desire to give to this last man as I also have given to you.” (Mt. 20:13-14; my translation)

The word “friend” used there by the Lord of the vineyard is not a show of affection. It is a word that says there is a mutually binding relationship and obligation between the speaker and the hearer, which the hearer is disregarding and perhaps even scornful of. So this word for friend is said with just a twinge of sarcasm and irony. The hearer regards the obligation from the standpoint of his own inflated ego, as though the only one needing to show a commitment is the Lord of the vineyard.

“But I deserve more,” the self-righteous, ego-driven, hot, tired all-day vineyard worker says. He thinks he has earned something more. By our own reason and experience in this life, to a person everyone here, I’m sure, would agree that the man who works all day in the vineyard deserves a greater reward than the people who worked just one, three, or five hours, compared to the twelve or more hours of the all-day workers.

I remember when I was a chemist just starting my first job at a small chemical company in Louisville, Kentucky. I was dumb and naïve. I was just thankful to be offered my first job and be able to move out of Mom and Dad’s house. When I was offered the job, I had no idea what the going rate was for a new chemist to be paid, and of course, when the job was offered, I just simply took what the man offered on the phone. Might have cost me a few dollars, a few denarii.

True enough, because as other young chemists with the same education came on to work – and the industry and local job scene got more competitive, so did the offers to new chemists in the next few years. After putting in two years at the company, thankfully, my boss was looking out for me, and saw to it that I received a bump to “catch me up” – at least, he and the company were honest. And all of you good American workers are silently speaking your “Amen” to this story, I know.

But remember, the kingdom of heaven is like the vineyard, and the Lord who runs it in that unbelievable way, where all workers are paid the same at the end of the day. In God’s kingdom, everyone receives a just reward, and that is the same reward, it turns out.

None of us has earned any reward from God in His kingdom. You know this – you are to do your duty toward God and neighbor, loving God above all else and the neighbor as yourself. Who among us has fully completed these obligations? None of us finish, much less win, that race. Too often we’re running aimlessly, boxing at the air, as Paul says in today’s epistle, and in the wake of our sin we hurt ourselves, hurt those around us, and are too easily hurt by others. Sin and temptation, idolatry and lust and covetousness get in the way each and every day. The mirror of God’s law does not lie, and we have no right whatsoever to speak up as if the Lord in His kingdom owes us something. Friend, I am not unrighteous to you, God says, as a Father lovingly must reason with a wayward son, you agreed to the denarius, but that itself, the reward, is actually more than you deserve.

Now if God was simply a vengeful judge, and held us to the wages the Law says we truly owe for failing to keep it, truly, not a single laborer would receive even a penny at the end of the day, but would instead receive temporal and eternal punishment, permanent separation from God, the pangs of hell itself.

Yet God is slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love, say the Scriptures so many times. Even to the complaining all-day laborers who begrudge the Lord’s gracious generosity, the promised wage is given. The Lord of the vineyard gathers workers into the vineyard all day long, while there is yet work to do, because He desires to show love and mercy, to give his lavish reward to all who are a part of His kingdom, even if it means they bear the brunt of the work, the burden of not being on the favored side of this world, even if it means the heat of persecution and temptation and trying times.

For these workers, we remember the promise of Jesus: “Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven…” (Mt. 5:12; ESV) That there is a reward there in heaven awaiting us, is quite simply beyond our understanding, a reward not of what we deserve but what is given to poor sinners out of pure, undeserved love, a reward unearned and undeserved like paying one full day’s wage to a worker who only worked one hour.

That reward is the prize Paul talks of in the epistle today. Athletes run and exercise and prepare for their events in order to win a perishable wreath, today, a perishable Super Bowl trophy, a perishable World Series trophy like the Cubs won this fall, a perishable Olympic gold medal. As much as we enjoy and have fun times around these rewards and those who win them, all of these will nevertheless melt away when the Lord does away with this temporal world at the end of time.

But we run the race of God’s kingdom to receive an imperishable and immortal reward. Paul writes to Timothy at the end of his time in the vineyard of God:

For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing. (2 Tim. 4:6–8; ESV)

The just reward of God in His kingdom is that which He has earned for you, on your behalf. It is the crown of His righteousness, which He has first earned, and has earned the right to award it to all who love His appearing. He earned that crown by being the blessed one who was persecuted, reviled, and killed, a lamb led to the slaughter, silent before his killers, enduring the shame and the scorn of the cross for your trespasses, taking upon Himself the burden of sin accumulated every day by each and every sinner who has ever lived, the burning heat of hell that you and every sinner so rightly deserved as your just reward.

Yet, instead, the Lord Jesus took that terrible reward, rejoicing and glad, even, scorning the shame of His cross, for He knew that His reward is great in heaven: to bring you with Him, whom He created and gave life to and whom He loves without condition, to the heavenly places. Yes, His reward is you, whom He has gathered from the highways and byways of this world, whom He has even at this late hour of this earth has brought into work in His vineyard with so many who have gone on before, you whom He would not let stand idly by, but preached His saving Gospel to you and baptized you into His death and resurrection and set before you that imperishable and immortal crown of His righteousness, and invited you to come and work and run the race with Him and so many who love His appearing.

What exactly will be that heavenly crown that awaits you, that victor’s wreath to be awarded at the last, what is the just reward Jesus has earned and gladly gives over to you at the end of the vineyard’s day?

It is that which God has prepared for those who love Him. This no eye has seen, and no ear has heard. It can only be described with such words as, “to see Him as He is” and “to be like Him”, risen and ascended body and soul to the right hand of God, “glory and honor and immortality.” It is to possess God even as He possesses us, to see God with our own eyes, and to serve Him fully and completely for all time, even as He sees and serves us. For all who love His appearing and long for such a reward, they count even abuse and persecution and reviling for the Lord’s Name at the hands of this world to be greater wealth than all the treasures that this world has to offer. For in the kingdom of God, in His blessed vineyard, to live is Christ, to die is gain.",Jacob Sutton,"Terre Haute, IN",2/12/2017,
"For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,” we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain. And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:16–21; ESV)

You need transfiguration. You need a great exodus from the slavery of sin that reigns in your mortal body. You need to shed this body of sin for the incorruptible and holy. The tears and fears and dashed hopes we all experience, the strained relationships, the hurtful words and actions, the abuse, the false witness, slander, and gossip that stings yourself and others, the specter of death, the mourning, the grieving, the loneliness, all of it the dark work of our corrupted sinful nature and the devil in our lives. We are far from reflecting in any sort of way the glory and holiness on view on the Mount of Transfiguration. But it is what we need, to shed this darkness for that holy and pure light – ‘Tis good Lord, it will be, to be there.

But that can only come through the forgiveness of sins. You need a Savior to earn the light of the resurrection through the dark punishment of the cross. You need a fellow Son of Man to be raised from death, to be declared the beloved Son, well pleased of the Father by that voice of the Majestic Glory – so that same Father would declare it of you too. That’s what Moses and Elijah were discussing in their heavenly conversation with the transfigured Jesus. This is what they had always preached and pointed to: that time of God appointed, when God’s Son would willingly hide His glory, so as to come and reveal it on Mount Calvary in the ultimate revelation of God’s love and mercy for fallen sinners. And later, the apostle Peter gets it: we now have a more sure prophetic word, he says, the Holy Spirit carries along the saving preaching of the prophets in these latter days to reveal just what God has done in Jesus Christ, so that men might hear, believe, and be given heavenly transfiguration, the final exodus from death into life.

Moses and Elijah were the two greatest Old Testament prophets. Neither of them claimed to be the Messiah of the people, neither of them created a system in which they were to be revered and worshipped. Both of them pointed forward, away from themselves, to the Seed of Abraham who was to come, pointing to the promised offspring who would save God’s people from sin and death. The One they pointed to is greater than they are. He is the mystery of the faith that they confirm.

Moses, through whom God performed so many wonders, from the Plagues to the Passover, who led God’s people out of Egypt in the Exodus, he went up on Mount Sinai to receive the Book of the Covenant and the Ten Commandments. There, on the top of the mountain, Moses was allowed to come into the very presence of God Himself and speak with Him, just as he did at the burning bush many years before.

Moses writes in Exodus that whenever he met with God and spoke to Him, his face would be reflecting back some of the radiant glory of God. This was a glimpse of heaven, where God is the source of all light, and His Word perfectly illumines all things. The preaching of God’s Word is the coming of heaven to earth, even when delivered by sinful men like Moses – precisely because it is God’s Word to His people, a lamp unto one’s feet, and a light for one’s path. His Word is to be listened to and believed in, it is holy and right and true, it is the source of all life, and it enlightens mankind.

Elijah was also used by God to preach His Word, to perform wonderful and mighty signs, calling for repentance, pointing to the promised Messiah to come. God used Elijah to raise the Zerapheth widow’s son from the dead, showing God’s power over death. At Elijah’s prayer, God sent fire from heaven that consumed the sacrifice on Mount Carmel, defeating the prophets of Baal, showing God’s power over sin and the devil.

After that incident, Elijah had to escape the sword of evil Queen Jezebel, hiding in a cave on Mount Horeb, the mount of God. (1 Kings 19.8) There, God promised Elijah in a still, small voice that he was not alone, that he had left a remnant in Israel that were faithful to God, that He was faithful to His promises, His Word. Even more, God had provided a new prophet who would carry on the work of preaching – Elisha. God took Elijah up to heaven alive in a mighty chariot of fire.

God’s Kingdom did not rest solely on Elijah’s shoulders or on Moses’. God’s Kingdom rests on the power of His Word, the promise of salvation in that Word, the power of God unto salvation for all who believe in Him. It would be the Word of God that points to the Lamb of God who would take away the sin of the world, that is what Moses and Elijah preached, that is the mystery of the faith to be preached, listened to, and believed.

On the Mount of Transfiguration, God uses Moses and Elijah’s presence with the Transfigured Lord Jesus to confirm the mysteries of the faith – that this transfigured Man was not just any person but is truly that Promised Seed, the Messiah that they and all of God’s prophets had faithfully been testifying to during their earthly preaching, which has been faithfully handed down in Holy Scripture. God had sent His promised Seed. God had indeed descended to earth to bring the joys of heaven to His own people, bringing His Heavenly Kingdom down to us. In Jesus Christ, God follows through and makes good on all of the promises He gave through His prophets.

This transfigured Man, whose face now truly shone with the Glory of God, was not just reflecting that Glory as Moses’ face had, but indeed He is that glory, He is glorious, He is holy, He is light, God Himself in the flesh, the source of light and life.

This transfigured Man, who speaks with His prophets and apostles, is the eternal Son who speaks His Word of peace and comfort, even through sinners like Moses, Elijah, and Peter, and pastors today, whose is the Word that carries out and delivers what He promises because God is good to His Word, always.

These are the mysteries of the faith that have been confirmed. We have not been given any cleverly devised myths. This is not some contrived story to explain some law-based religion, there are no shrines to visit, no mountains to climb. The Son of God has come to be one in the flesh with Moses, Elijah, and all of us, to deliver us by His greater Exodus, a greater Passover, a greater demonstration of power than moving aside the Red Sea, than fire from heaven and raising the widow’s son, and He reveals it to us in preaching so that we would believe it and be saved by it.

Jesus would allow himself to be consumed on the cross, using His death to save us from ours, and His Resurrection to guarantee us our own eternal life in Him. This means that the Way to salvation and eternal life with God leads not up a mountain, but in God’s Son going down off the mountain, to Jerusalem. God’s Son did not come to receive glory on the mountain – but instead, He has come to exchange it, His life to save ours, His glory given over that we might share in His glory for all eternity.

So His Way leads through the cross, where He dies our death. It leads through the tomb, where He sanctifies our grave by lying in it, holy and perfect. It leads through the Resurrection, where He lives all glorious and brings to light our eternal life, our promised immortality. His Way leads to the great day of your Baptism, that “mystery” where through simple water and at His Word, our Heavenly Father declares once and for all over each of you, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”

Listen to this prophetic Word more sure: Arise and fear not, says Jesus. God’s Kingdom comes down even now to you, despite your sin, your shame, your failures, your troubles, your doubts, your heartaches, your grief – God has become one with you in your Baptism, and even now desires to give you His same glorified and resurrected flesh and blood under bread and wine, to strengthen you to that day when he orders you to arise from your grave.

Listen in faith, dear Christians, to that more sure prophetic Word, what Moses, Elijah, and all the prophets and apostles testify and preach of: the Son of God and Son of Man has been crucified and resurrected for you, and the gift of eternal life in Him is yours. In Him, you will be resurrected; you will be transfigured, shining with His glory. The Old Adam will finally be totally gone, and the New Man will have totally arisen, and we will live in the glorious presence of God Himself for all eternity.

God grant that day to come soon! Amen.",Jacob Sutton,"Terre Haute, IN",2/5/2017,
"We know the Nunc Dimittis from all the times we have sung it following reception of the Lord’s Supper. “Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace…” We have already spoken these words in the blessing of the candles, “A light to lighten the Gentiles...”, and we will sing them again many times. These words speak to us so clearly, for we face what old Simeon faced, what every sinner faces - the hour of our departure from this temporal world, as the hymn says, “…when the dark grave engulfs its prey.”

Today, God’s Word brings us into the Temple in Jerusalem, forty days after the birth of our Lord. Mary and Joseph ‘present’ this month old baby boy, our Lord Jesus Christ. Simeon receives Him into his wrinkled hands. Yet, there’s another actor in this story. Mary and Joseph were watching God fulfill John 3:16. God the Father, so loving the world, gives His only-begotten Son (and Mary’s Son), that whosoever believeth in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. That’s quite a little lamb Mary brings to the Temple.

In presenting Jesus at the Temple, the Law is being fulfilled on your behalf – even this little law of “presenting” the firstborn child to the Lord, and the time of purifying the mother – perfectly fulfilled, never by me, but always by Christ, for me. Jesus is the lamb of price, the whole burnt offering of all time, brought to a place of blood and sacrifice, where God by His grace and mercy taught people the price needed for sin – without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.

And so here is Jesus, conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin, circumcised on the 8th day and presented on this one, already on His path to shed His blood, to make that ultimate sacrifice. Much later, under the crucifying threats of Pontius Pilate, Jesus could say, “For this cause I was born” (Jn 18:37). Born for this. And every step after, circumcised for this, presented for this – to be crucified. This baby story is “God so loving the world” – the Father handing His Son over, giving His Son for what will end in death and so bring about your resurrection with Him.

Old Simeon in the Holy Spirit’s power knew this truth. He had been promised through the Holy Spirit that he would not die until He had seen the Lord Christ in the flesh. Simeon received the Holy Baby into his arms, a pure gift. And the heavenly chorus was given an earthly voice. “Now You are releasing Your servant, Lord, according to the word of Yours, in peace, because my eyes have seen Your salvation, whom You have prepared before the face of all people, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory to your people Israel” (St. Luke 2.29-32, my translation)

All believers in Christ have likewise been promised the same. Since Jesus fulfilled the Law on our behalf, died to pay for our sins and rose again to win life for us, we are made sons of God in Christ, and if sons, heirs, and if heirs who can call God our “Father,” then our inheritance is eternal life. We will not truly see death, we will with our own eyes see our Redeemer in the flesh. We will be released from this life according to our Lord’s word. We will face that release with peace because our salvation death and hell is secure and certain. That same baby whom Simeon once received, having innocently died the payment death for sin on our behalf, now lives and reigns in glory to all eternity, and by the work of His Holy Spirit gathers us into His Church to be called, gathered, enlightened, and sanctified, like Old Simeon.

This is true light in our dark world, a real candle shining that cannot be hidden, that will never snuff out. This is true enlightenment, true comfort for today and tomorrow. Not even death can truly defeat us. We can face the darkness and coldness of the grave and know like Simeon did that we will defy it. We can confess with Simeon that there is “peace” where there appears to be anguish, upset, upheaval, uncertainty, even in the face of death. Nothing in this life, not our sin, not our shortcomings, not anything in all creation, and certainly not death, can ever overcome the peace we have with God because of Christ’s sacrificial, atoning life, death, and resurrection on our behalf. Nothing can ever separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus, nor from each other as we abide in His true faith.

With all the saints, with Mary, Joseph, faithful Simeon and Anna, and all the faithful, we will be raised in Christ body and soul to live eternally in the new heavens and the new earth that God has prepared for His children, to live forever in the glory of the true Israel, with all who find in Christ their joy and glory.",Jacob Sutton,"Terre Haute, IN",2/2/2017,
"Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley were two English Theologians who stood against the teachings of the pope. Because of this, Both Ridley and Latimer were sentenced to death by the Catholic authorities and were burned at the stake in Oxford on October 16, 1555. As he was being tied to the stake, Ridley prayed, “Oh, Heavenly Father, I give unto thee most hearty thanks that thou hast called me to be a professor of thee, even unto death. I beseech thee, Lord God, have mercy on this realm of England, and deliver it from all her enemies.” Shortly after the flames were lit and rose up to consume their bodies, Latimer was heard saying, “Be of good cheer, Mr. Ridley, and play the man! We shall this day light such a candle by God’s grace in England, as I trust shall never be put out.”

Now why is it that these two martyrs can face such a devastating and painful death with such peace, comfort, and fearlessness? And why do the disciples in today’s reading seem to share none of the peace, comfort, and fearlessness of Latimer and Ridley as they face a storm at sea?

The truth is that, at this point, the disciples are still unsure of who Jesus is. They’ve witnessed him heal a leper, the centurion’s servant, Peter’s mother-in-law, and many others. Yet, they still hadn’t figured out what it all meant. Is he a great miracle worker, prophet, teacher? But, if he is just these things- then that doesn’t do anything for the crippling fear of facing death. A prophet, a teacher, even a miracle worker doesn’t bring comfort in the face of death and serious struggle.

Do you see what the devil does? He whispers into your ear, and imparts fear into you. He tells you that God really isn’t in control, that God’s will won’t actually be done. When you find out that you’ve come down with cancer, when financial struggles come, when you feel alone and unloved. The devil whispers into your ear that God has abandoned you, that He isn’t with you, and He isn’t in control. And then the crippling fear takes over- as your faith weakens. And this is the state of the disciples as the storm rages against their boat. Crippled with fear.

But then Jesus does something extraordinary. With a word, he calms the wind and the sea. Have you ever thought about the magnitude of that? Wind is controlled by a combination of atmospheric pressure, land formation, the rotation of the planet, magnetic fields, weather patterns in neighboring regions, and so on. And this is only part of what controls the violence of the sea. Yet, as the Disciples now marvel at as they realize: “even the wind and sea obey Him.”

The disciples are shocked. “What sort of man is this, that even the winds and sea obey Him?” The answer to their question changes everything. Jesus isn’t merely a teacher or a prophet- he has authority over creation itself. Jesus, this man who sleep in the boat with them, is God!

And this is why Latimer can say to Ridley, “Be of Good cheer,” while they face the fires of death. Because they have a God who has ultimate authority. And this God doesn’t only have authority over the winds and the sea. He has authority over the root cause for all the storms of life, and even death itself.

In the beginning, God created and it was good. Yet, once sin entered the world, all of creation was corrupted- the sea now became a place of violence and death. The earth became hostile, people died, diseases spread, and men became enslaved by demons. All of this took place because of the virus of sin. Yet, here we see Jesus: he casts out demons, heals the sick, raises the dead, and calms the storms. Jesus has authority over these things because he has authority over sin- because he is God.

Do you know why Latimer and Ridley can be of good cheer when they face their death? It is because they have a savior who couldn’t. After Jesus had been tortured and nailed upon the cross, when he approached his impending death, he didn’t cry out, “Oh, Heavenly Father, I give unto thee most hearty thanks.” No. He cried out, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me.” When Jesus died, he was utterly alone. He was forsaken by the world, forsaken by his disciples, and forsaken by His Father in heaven. Jesus faced the death and punishment which all sinners deserve. And he did this so that you and me, and Ridley and Latimer, would never have to face that death.

When things are tough in your life, when you face struggles, and suffering, and death. You can find peace, and comfort, and you can be fearless, because you know that your God has paid the price for your sins. And when fear attempts to tell you that “God’s will” will not be done in your life- that you are alone, that you are forgotten. Remember that Jesus, the man who calmed the winds and the sea, faced the fear of death himself. He submitted to the terror of the cross, and by doing so- conquered death. For on the third day, he Rose. Jesus experienced all of the pains and suffering and consequences of sin alone so that you don’t have to. He did all of this so that you can be like Latimer and Ridley- knowing that nothing in this world can keep you from your eternal home in Heaven.

So be of good cheer. For the light which Christ has lit will not be put out, and His will for you will surely be done today, and tomorrow, and for all of eternity.

Thanks be to God.

Amen.",Bryan Stecker,"Terre Haute, IN",1/29/2017,
"2016 has certainly been a year of change. Who would have thought that the Cubs would win the
World Series?
Sadly, a lot of the change that has happened over the past year has not been good. The idea of
having a “civil discourse” in our country seems like a thing of the past. People are more minded
to insult than listen - leading to mistrust, division and, in some cases, violence. Lifestyles that
used to be considered shameful are now celebrated. Materialism is running rampant and there is
palpable selfishness in our society, where even acts of charity are primarily done to make people
“feel good” about themselves.
How are Christians to face all these changes around us? Does God want us to change with the
world and adapt to its morality - as some unfaithful church bodies are doing? Or does he want us
to do the opposite and be like hate filled people who protest military funerals – chanting curses
on America and its people?
God wants us to do neither. Rather, he wants us to seek refuge in His unchangeable Son. 1)
Jesus is the same Savior who lived, died and rose again for our salvation. 2) He is the Christ,
who rules over all for the benefit of His Church.
Part One: Jesus is the same Savior who lived, died and rose again for our salvation.
Our devotion text is part of the final instruction with which the author of Hebrews completes his
epistle. It is sandwiched between an exhortation to follow the example of faithful leaders and an
encouragement to stay away from “strange teachings”, which are any teachings that try to entice
us away from the Gospel of God’s grace.
Why is our devotion text sandwiched between these two exhortations? It’s there to remind us
that, even though the world is constantly telling us to believe new things and live in new ways,
the Gospel of Christ never changes. We don’t have to be like so many on this earth: confused by
all the different religions and denominations, wondering what’s true and who to believe. Jesus
Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Our Savior God never changes. And what a
comfort this is for us who live in a world that is constantly searching for meaning and peace, but
never finding it.
And why will the world never find peace in the unchanging Gospel of Christ? Because it doesn’t
want to believe that it needs a savior. The world does not want to acknowledge that its selfish
desires and passions are evil. It doesn’t want to admit that it's subject to God. All people in this
world have inherited from Adam and Eve the same sinful desire with which they fell into sin: the
desire to be their own god and master of their own fate – subject to no one but themselves.
And our society is driven by this sinful rebellion against God. It makes one's “feelings” king.
This is why “right and wrong” are never discussed on the basis of what God’s Word says, but on
how a person “feels.”
“Follow your heart. Do what you think is best. Don’t let anyone keep you from doing what you
want to do.” – this is the religion of our society, a religion that constantly changes with the
whims of the human heart. The world condemns us for making it feel bad when we witness the
truth. It calls us unloving, intolerant, hateful and inhibiting human progress with our archaic
views. The world says that we should be more understanding and accepting, and embrace
everyone’s feelings and ideas.
But what the world fails to realize is that human nature is utterly corrupt. The feelings and
passions people naturally pursue are not godly and right. They are sinful and wrong. Jesus once
said: For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false
testimony, slander. These are what make a man ‘unclean’. (Matthew 15:19-20 NIV84) Listen
also to God’s assessment of the human heart: The Lord saw how great man’s wickedness on the
earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the
time. (Genesis 6:5 NIV84).
Thankfully our LORD saw our lost condition and decided to have mercy on us and to save us
from our own wickedness. And how would he accomplish this? By taking on human flesh and
blood so that he could win the righteousness we need by living a life of perfect obedience to His
law. Having accomplished that, he then suffered and died for the sins of the whole world. He
did this so that whoever looks to him in repentance and faith might be forgiven of all sin and
have eternal life.
Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever. Just as God’s holy law stands
unchanged in its condemnation of sin, so also Christ’s redeeming work that paid for the sins of
the world stands firm forever. By means of the Holy Spirit working through his Word, the LORD
shows us our sins that we might repent of them. More importantly, he shows us what he did to
save us from the hell we had earned. There is not a single sin he didn’t atone for. He will keep
his promise to watch over believers throughout their earthly life until he delivers them home to
heaven.
Therefore, in a world that is constantly changing its ideas of right and wrong to suit the passions
of its sinful heart, how are we Christians to react? First of all by seeking refuge ourselves in the
changeless love of Christ – for we too have a corrupt heart and constantly need his forgiveness.
And then, we can share His changeless Gospel with the world – speaking the truth in love.
And what will that look like – speaking the truth in love? Well, it certainly doesn’t look like
those false Christians who espouse hate in protests with signs saying: “God damn America” and
cheer whenever something bad happens to the homosexual community. But it also is not staying
silent when people are pursuing any kind of life style that the Bible calls sinful.
Rather, speaking the truth in love is just that: lovingly pointing out what the Bible says about sin
and our need for salvation, and then directing people to the same Savior that we ourselves need –
encouraging them to repent of their sin and turn to him in faith. Jesus Christ is the same
yesterday and today and forever. He continues to be the same Savior who lived, died and rose
for the forgiveness of all sin - lovingly calling people to repentance and faith through our witness
of him. He also continues to be the Christ who rules over everything for the benefit of his
Church.
Part Two: He is the Christ, who rules over all for the benefit of His Church.
Sadly, some of the people we witness to will not accept our message. Influenced by the
unbelieving world they will either ignore our loving call to repent or they will get mad at us for
making them feel guilty. And, as the godlessness of our world continues to increase, we will feel
even more pressure to either keep quiet or give up our faith. Already now we sometimes feel so
helpless and alone. We feel like we are under attack – fighting a losing battle.
But we are not fighting a losing battle. Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
He is the same God who rescued the Israelites from their slavery to Egypt, cast out demons
during his ministry on earth, conquered the devil by means of his cross and showed his victory
over the grave by rising from the dead. Jesus is the Christ who ascended into heaven to rule over
all things for the benefit of his Church.
I know, with all the evil that goes on in the world – especially towards Christians – it might seem
like the devil is more in control than the LORD. But God’s Word reassures us that Jesus is
working in all things for the benefit of those who love him. During his earthly ministry, Jesus
even prophesied about the various persecutions and pressures we would face as Christians –
especially as the day of his return approached. “In this world you will have trouble,” Jesus once
told his disciples, “But take heart! I have overcome the world."" (John 16:33 NIV84)
Yes, Jesus has overcome the world. He sits in heaven with the same authority by which He
created the World. He watches over us with the save love that moved him to suffer and die for
our sins. And he will come again to give us the deliverance and justice he constantly promised
to bring throughout the centuries.
Even though our world can seem like a chaotic mess, know that Jesus Christ is the same
yesterday and today and forever. His justice, power, love and mercy have not changed. He will
continue doing everything he promised. Take refuge in him knowing that, no matter how scary
the future may look for Christians, our loving Savior is still in control. Amen. ",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/31/2016,
"Over the mountains he ran, his lungs gasping for air and his heart bursting with excitement. The
trek was long, but he didn’t care. He had great news for the people of his city. Filled with joy
over the victory he had just witnessed, this soldier pressed on, running over rough, rocky ground,
up, down and around the mountains. As soon as he was in ear shot of the watchmen, he cried out
as loud as his exhausted lungs would allow: “Victory! Victory!”
The watchmen who heard him from the distance could not believe their ears. Did they hear him
correctly? Was he yelling, “victory”? Yes, it’s true. “Victory! Victory!” the watchmen began
shouting with the herald. Soon the whole city was jubilantly cheering!
And now you know the ancient legend from which the modern Marathon stems. A soldier named
Pheidippides ran from the plains of Marathon to Athens (26 miles) to announce the Greek victory
over the Persians. Why was this news so important? Because it originally looked like the Greek
army was doomed. They faced an enemy 4 times larger than them. Most thought that Athens was
lost. But victory, oh, how joyous the news! It was an announcement that the Greeks never forgot.
Last night we heard a more thrilling announcement than the one Pheidippides brought to Athens.
Let us recall and rejoice in the good news of Christ’s birth under the theme: Listen! Did you hear
the good news? Our God has come to work out our salvation.
Our sermon text is taken from a section of the Old Testament book of Isaiah, where the Lord
promised to send a special servant who would save his people from their sins. A few verses before
our text the Lord talks about his deliverance in this way: ""You were sold for nothing, and without
money you will be redeemed.""i

The LORD knew that we could not free ourselves from our slavery to sin, death and the power of
the devil. Only he could do it. He could not use gold or silver either. No, he had to use something
much more costly to pay for our freedom: the life blood of his beloved Son. But our Lord loved
us so much that he was willing to pay that price. He sent his Son to earth to be our Savior. 
Therefore, on a Judean night not unlike any other, while shepherds were out in the fields tending
their flocks, the sky ripped open and a host of beautiful, heavenly messengers appeared over the
mountains surrounding Bethlehem – announcing the good news of Jesus' birth to a group of
shepherds.
How beautiful the sight must have been! How wonderful their message! The shepherds were told
that a Savior had been born, who would bring “peace” to earth. And why was this message
important? Because, prior to Christ, God and mankind were at odds with each other. Even though
God created the human race, our first father and mother rebelled against him. And this rebellious
nature has been passed down from generation to generation. By nature people hate God and
oppose his will.
Now some of you might be thinking: “I don’t ever remember hating God before I became a
Christian, so how can you say that I did?” Think of it this way: if we were to take Christ out of
the picture and only had God’s law, how could we not hate God? Why? Because He asks us to
do things that our sinful nature does not want to do. God demands a perfection that no mere human
can achieve. God threatens so severe a punishment for those who disobey him that we would be
left to despair. Yes, if we were without Christ, we would hate God. Our sinful natures are at
enmity with him.
But God did not want this. He wanted to save the human race from its sin. So what did God do?
He took on human flesh and blood. Is there any greater sign of peace? The baby born in Bethlehem
is true God and true man. The two that were at enmity are united in Christ Jesus. He came to win
peace for us by forgiving our sins so that we might always be united with God. He is our Savior.
An interesting aspect of our sermon text is that it stands right before one of the most moving
portions of Old Testament Scripture, which talks about how the Christ would suffer and die to win
our salvation, how he would be crushed for our sins and bruised for our iniquities. The punishment
that brings us peace would be upon him and by his wounds we would be healed. In other words,
the only way our salvation could be accomplished was for a divine Savior to perfectly keep God’s
law for us and suffer His severe punishment for sin in our place. And this is exactly what the Son
of God took on human flesh to do. This was the message the angels had for the shepherds keeping
watch over their flocks near Bethlehem. It was a victory message that brought them great joy.
7How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of a herald, who announces peace and preaches
good news. He announces salvation and says to Zion, “Your God is king!” 8The voice of your
watchmen—they lift up their voices. Together they shout for joy, because with both eyes they will
see it when the LORD returns to Zion.
Imagine being there and hearing the news the shepherds heard: The LORD has kept his promise.
The LORD has returned to his people. Oh, the joy! Is it true? Has he really returned? The
shepherds ran to Bethlehem to see it with their own eyes, and behold: there was the baby they
heard about. There was his young mother, a virgin. With their own eyes the Shepherds saw their
salvation: the LORD incarnate lying on a bed of hay.
9Break out, shout for joy together, you ruins of Jerusalem, because the LORD is comforting his
people. He is redeeming Jerusalem.
The Shepherds were so overjoyed at what they heard and saw that they had to tell others. They
ran through out the streets of their little town singing the praise of God, waking up all they could
with their wonderful message. I am sure that there were some who were not happy with the
shepherds waking them up from their sleep, but the shepherds didn’t care. Mankind sat in the ruin
of sin. All had seemed lost, but look: here shines the hope of victory. The LORD himself has come
to comfort his people. He has come to redeem them from their sins. This news could not wait!
10The LORD lays bare his holy arm before the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth
will see the salvation from our God.
Consider what the Lord was doing at Christmas: he was rolling up his sleeves to do the dirty work
of saving us. He had to do it because there was no one who could do it for him. The Lord spoke
through Isaiah:
5
I looked, but there was no one to help, I was appalled that no one gave support;
so my own arm worked salvation for me, and my own wrath sustained me.
ii
 God worked out our
salvation, showing his strength and love. He did it in full view of the world, that all might see it
and believe in him.
You know, we believers are a lot like the shepherds. No, angels did not appear to us in the fields,
but at some point in our lives a messenger did come and tell us the good news about Christ. This
messenger might have been a parent, grandparent, friend, relative, pastor or teacher. How beautiful
this messenger is to us! Why? Because of the wonderful message he or she proclaimed:
redemption, forgiveness of sins, peace with God, and everlasting life through faith in God’s Son!
And what was our response to this news? Like the Shepherds, we had to go see if it was true. We
ran to the Bible and there we saw with our very own eyes of faith that which the shepherds saw.
It is true: God has come to earth to save us from our sins!
And what was our response? Like the Shepherds, we were overjoyed! I love seeing the joy that
new Christians have for the Gospel. They are often so fired up that they can’t help but tell other
people the wonderful news they heard and believed. They often confess Christ so fearlessly that
they can put mature Christians to shame. And that brings me to my next point: where is that
Christmas zeal with us?
Some times the trials of life get us down. Sometimes we think that, because we have heard this
message so much, it is yesterday’s news. The devil is always trying to take our zeal for the Gospel
away. But let me tell you: the message of God taking on human flesh and blood to save us from
our sins is never old news. There are many people on this earth who either haven’t heard or do
not understand this message. They are still at enmity with God - under the devil’s power. They
have no peace. How will they believe and be saved if they don’t hear the message? How will they
hear if they are not told? Having heard the message ourselves, how can we not be like the
Shepherds of Bethlehem and share this news with them?
Yes, some people will be annoyed with us as they were annoyed with the shepherds. They do not
want to be awakened from their spiritual slumber. But all who believe the Gospel we share will 
be saved. St. Paul speaks of this in Romans 10: ""Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will
be saved."" 14 How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they
believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone
preaching to them? 15 And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, ""How
beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news! . . . 17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing
the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.""
iii
Marathons are still run today - all in memory of the good news of Athens’ deliverance from the
Persians. If this event is remembered, which is of absolutely no consequence to us, how much
more should we remember the great message of deliverance from sin, death and the devil God
brought about by sending his Son into the world? How much more should we remember the race
the shepherds ran to tell all they could of the Lord’s deliverance? This message has meaning for
every person alive today.
So don’t be afraid to tell everyone you know about your Savior. Don't worry about what they will
think or how you can convince them of the truth. Just do what the shepherds did and share the
good news that you yourself have heard. Say to them: Listen! Did you hear the good news?
Our God has come to work out our salvation. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/25/2016,
"What is the true meaning of Christmas?
I know that this might seem like a silly question, but the reason I ask it is because many don’t
know the answer. Some think they can find Christmas’ true meaning in spending time with family
and friends. Others seek to find its meaning in acts of charity. Still others say that the true
meaning of “the holidays” can be found in whatever your heart chooses to find meaning in.
Regardless of what people think, there is only one place where the true meaning of Christmas can
be found: in the Bible, and it is summarized in the words the angel spoke to the shepherds: “Today
in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord”
Let us consider this marvelous, angelic message and discover what Christmas is truly all about,
namely: 1) Our need for a Savior being fulfilled. 2) The Lord himself making his dwelling among
us.
Part One: Christmas is about our need for a Savior being fulfilled.
From an earthly point of view, the night on which Jesus was born was probably like any other.
Underneath the sky near Bethlehem, shepherds were faithfully doing what they always did:
keeping watch over their flocks. But on this night, something amazing happened – something that
made heaven burst with joy.
What was it? An angel of the LORD appeared to tell both the shepherds and us: Today in the town
of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.
The birth of the Savior – this is what Christmas is all about. But why is that so important? Because
mankind is sinful and needs a savior.
It all goes back to the Garden of Eden and our first parents: Adam and Eve. God created them in
his likeness: perfect, holy and without any sin. However, instead of being content with all the
blessings the LORD had given them, Adam and Eve wanted more: they wanted to be their own 
gods. This is why, at the devil’s prompting, they disobeyed the LORD - eating fruit from the tree
from which God forbade them to eat. They rebelled. They sinned against him.
Because of this suffering, pain, death and the threat of hell came into the world. Human nature
had been corrupted. From now on all people born after Adam and Eve would no longer be good
and holy. Sinful flesh would give birth to sinful flesh - all future generations would inherit the
total depravity of sin.
Human nature is corrupt. I know that most people don’t want to believe this – especially around
the holidays – but it’s true. Want proof? Just look at all the wars, crime, hurt and hunger there is
in the world. If the human heart was truly good, none of those evils would exist.
But the outside world isn’t the only one who needs a Savior. We all do because we have all
inherited the same corrupt nature the world inherited. We are all evil. I know these words hurt.
We don’t want to think of ourselves as all that bad. We like to think we are better than the really
bad people of the world, who rape women, abuse children and kill indiscriminately. “They are the
ones deserving of hell - not us,” we like to think. But here’s the thing: God does not compare us
to other people. He compares us to his Holy law, which states: whoever keeps the whole law and
yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.i
 It also says: There is no difference, all
have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
ii
 According to the Bible, we all deserve hell, because
none of us have lived up to the perfect standard God set in his Holy Law. We all need a savior
from sin!
I know that so far my sermon does not seem all too Christmassy, but please understand why: it is
only when we truly understand our need for a Savior that the true beauty, joy and wonder of
Christmas begins to shine. Listen again to the angels’ announcement to the shepherds: a Savior
has been born to you. In other words, there is a God in heaven who loves you so much, that He
did something beyond all comprehension to save you. God so loved the world that he gave his
one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.iii
Part Two: Christmas is about the LORD himself making his dwelling among us.
Christmas is all about the Savior being born. And who is this Savior? The angel tells us in his
announcement to the shepherds: He is Christ the Lord.”
The child to whom Mary gave birth is true God and true man. He is the LORD himself, who is
described in the Old Testament as the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding
in love and faithfulness, maintaining love to thousands, and forgiving wickedness, rebellion and
sin.iv
 Just think: little baby Jesus is the almighty Creator of all - as the book of Isaiah prophesied:
The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel,v which means
God with us.
Because Jesus was born from a virgin, he didn’t inherit the sinful, human corruption that had been
passed down from generation to generation. He is true God and man, and as such he would save
us from our sins.
But how would he accomplish that? First of all by living the perfect, sinless life of love and
obedience to God’s law that we all failed to live. By doing this he would win the righteousness
we need to stand before God. Then, having taken all our sins upon himself, he would die for them
on the cross – suffering the very punishment we deserve for them. This act would satisfy God’s
justice. And then, proving that God’s justice had been satisfied, Jesus would rise from the dead.
His resurrection would demonstrate that mankind has been reconciled with God. Because of this
work, whoever looks to him in repentance and faith is forgiven of all sin – regardless of how bad
and numerous those sins have been. The person who repents and believes in Jesus is at peace with
God and will inherit eternal life.
What’s the true meaning of Christmas? It is found in the angel’s message: “Today in the town of
David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the Lord.” Amen

"Have you ever received a gift that you didn’t know what to do with because you didn’t know what
it was? My kids sort of received a gift like that from my brother last year. When they opened it
up, it just looked like a model robot. But, after finding out more about the gift, they realized that
it was much more than a mere model: it could dance, follow them around, play music – all sorts
of stuff. That information made them enjoy the gift a lot more.
Did you know that God’s great gift of Jesus is one that many people don’t know what to do with?
What makes his birth so special that we continue to celebrate it thousands of years after it occurred?
What meaning and relevance could it possibly have for us today?
Let us listen to an angel explain the answer to these questions, under the theme: Who will this
child be? The angel tells us: 1) He is Jesus, the LORD’s Savior. 2)He is Immanuel, God with
us.
Part 1: He is Jesus, the LORD’s Savior
Our text begins: 18This is how the birth of Jesus Christ took place. His mother, Mary, was pledged
in marriage to Joseph.
Please understand their situation correctly: Mary and Joseph were not merely engaged. According
to the custom of their culture, their pledge made them legally married in the eyes of the state. To
put it in modern terms, it’s as if Mary and Joseph signed and legally submitted their marriage
license months before having the actual ceremony. However, because they both highly honored 
the estate of marriage, they agreed not to come together as husband and wife until after their
planned, wedding feast. But. . .
Before they came together, she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit.
We don’t know whether Mary told Joseph about her pregnancy or he found out on his own, but I
am convinced that (after he found out) Mary did her best to explain to Joseph about the angel's
visit, that she still was a virgin and that the baby inside of her was from the Holy Spirit. But Joseph
still saw the sad fact: Mary was pregnant and the baby was not his child.”
19Joseph, her husband, was a righteous man and did not want to disgrace her. So he decided to
divorce her privately.
I certainly feel for Joseph. I can imagine him thinking: “Mary is a God-fearing woman. She isn’t
one to lie to me. Her relative, Elizabeth, is strangely pregnant in her old age. Could Mary be
telling the truth? And if she is, what does this mean for me? But then again, how can I know for
certain? Whose child is she carrying?”
Mary seemed to have committed adultery, which was punishable by death. But Joseph loved Mary
dearly. He didn’t want her to suffer public disgrace. Maybe he even wanted to believe what she
said, but couldn’t. That’s probably why he decided that it would be best if he used some lame
excuse other than adultery to get a divorce. No one would think anything about it and Mary would
be safe.
20But as he was considering these things, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared to him in a
dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because
the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21She will give birth to a son, and you are to give
him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”
God gave Joseph the reassurance and direction he needed by sending an angel. Notice that the
angel calls Joseph a “son of David,” reminding him of the prophecy that the Messiah would come
from the house and line of David, to which both he and Mary belonged.
Then the angel reassured him that what his wife told him about the baby was true: Mary had not
cheated on him. She was still a virgin. The baby inside her was conceived from the Holy Spirit -
brought about by the will of God. The LORD chose Mary to be the mother of the promised Savior
and wanted Joseph to be her husband – protecting and providing for both mother and child.
And, acting as the baby’s earthly father, Joseph was to name him Jesus – the Greek version of the
Hebrew name Joshua, which literally means, “The LORD’s Savior.” Yes, Jesus’ name would
perfectly describe who he is and what he came to do.
Now, there are certainly many different kinds of “saviors” on this earth. Firefighters, paramedics,
doctors, and charitable people (just to name a few) all save people in one way or another. What
would make Jesus different from all these kind of saviors? The angel tells us: “he will save his
people from their sins.” 
And what is sin? It’s both the desire and act of breaking God’s holy Law. Sin infects us so
thoroughly that it corrupts our nature. Because of sin we love evil, and not what is good. This is
plainly evident every time we turn on the TV and see so called “entertainment,” which glorifies
sex, violence, greed and pride. But we don’t even need to turn on the TV to know this. All we
need to do is look into our hearts and take note of our thoughts, which often put “self” first and
think poorly of others. Our own hearts testify of our rebellious sin, as we covet the things that
don’t belong to us and blame God for all that is wrong in the world. Sin separates us from God.
Because of sin we deserve God’s eternal punishment in hell.
But God the Father didn’t want us lost to the depths of hell. This is why he promised to send a
Savior from sin: someone who would both perfectly keep God’s Holy Law in our place and suffer
the punishment we deserve. By doing these two things, our Savior would satisfy God’s justice
and win our salvation.
However, no mere man could ever accomplish these things. This is why our Savior had to be both
true God and man in one person: so that he could be under the law and die, and apply his perfect
life, innocent death and glorious resurrection to all. This is why Jesus had to be born of a virgin
birth. The Lord’s Savior couldn’t just be a mere man. He needed to be God with us!
Part 2: He is Immanuel, God with us.
The angel continued: 22All this happened to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet: 23“Look, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son. And they will name him
Immanuel,” which means, “God with us.”
Wonder above all wonders – just think about what the name Immanuel means! The Creator united
himself with his creation in a way that seems unimaginable. Our God left his glorious, heavenly
home to take on human flesh and blood in the womb of a virgin. He became one with his rebellious
creation in order to save them.
Immanuel – God with us. What a wonderful name! God became like you and me. He was tempted
in every way as we are, with one very important exception: he remained sinless. He suffered pain,
sorrow and death, just like we do, in order that we might become like him: sinless, holy and loved
by God. Because He rose from the dead, we too will rise from the dead. Because he ascended
into heaven, we too will ascend into heaven. Because he has eternal life, we too will have eternal
life. The LORD will accomplish this for everyone who holds on to him in repentance and faith.
And our God wasn’t just with humanity when Jesus was born and walked this earth. He is with us
now, as he promised, “surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.""i
 God is with us in
worship, as we gather around his Gospel. He is with us when we partake of the Lord’s Supper,
receiving the very body and blood he used on the cross to forgive our sins. Jesus promises to make
his dwelling in every believer’s heart – guiding and directing us through life as we meditate on
His Word.
How can our hearts not jump for joy? What a wonderful revelation the angel gave Joseph: God
was fulfilling his promise. Who would Mary’s child be? He would be mankind’s Savior from sin.
He would be God with us.
And what was Joseph’s response to this wonderful news? 24When Joseph woke up from his sleep,
he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him. He took Mary home as his wife, 25but he was
not intimate with her until she gave birth to her firstborn son. And he named him Jesus.
God gave Joseph the responsibility of being a husband to Mary and a father to her son. Joseph
believed the Lord’s message and performed his duty with great zeal. Because he obeyed, Jesus
would be born into a family, and would not be considered a child of sin. Joseph also refrained
from having any intimate union with his wife until after God’s Son was born – thereby making
sure that the virgin birth would remain unquestioned. At the baby’s birth Joseph gave him the
name Jesus and made sure to take care of both his wife and her child as best he could.
Now, what is our response to the angel’s news? In one week we will be celebrating
Christmas. God has graciously revealed to us who Jesus is and why his birth is important: He is
our promised Savior from sin. He is God with us. Like Joseph, we too have been awakened to
this knowledge. Are we now going to just sit here and go back to sleep, or are we, like Joseph,
going to act out of faith? The message is certainly compelling us to act! Let us prepare for
Christmas by encouraging one another to come and meditate on the blessed news of Jesus’ birth.
Invite your family and friends who aren’t here today to come, see and experience Immanuel – God
with us – this Christmas. Explain to them why you celebrate his birth. Tell them what meaning
God’s gift of the Savior has for their life. Then we will all be ready to receive God’s Son with joy
this Christmas, understanding how Jesus’ birth is one of the greatest demonstrations of God’s love
for all mankind. Amen ",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/18/2016,
"What kind of expectations do you have for Christ? What kind of Savior do you imagine him to
be? Are your expectations of him correct – based on God’s Word? With our sermon text as our
guide, let us reevaluate Our Christmas Expectations for the Christ. 1) Ask Him Who He is.
2) Listen to His Servant, who uses His Word
Part 1: Ask Him Who He is
Our sermon text takes place well into Jesus’ ministry. At this time John the Baptist had been
arrested by Herod for preaching against his adulterous relationship with Herodias.
2While John was in prison, he heard about the things Christ was doing. He sent two of his
disciples 3
to ask him, “Are you the Coming One or should we wait for someone else?
Wait a second: did we hear this right? Is John the Baptist, the very forerunner of the Messiah
who not only directed people to Jesus by saying, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the
sin of the world!”
i but also heard God the Father say at Jesus’ baptism, “This is my Son, whom I
love. Listen to him!""
ii
– is this the man who sent some of his disciples to ask Jesus whether or not
he was the promised Christ? How can this be?
In order to understand John’s question, we should take a little time to review his ministry. As the
forerunner of the Messiah, John lived a very ascetic lifestyle in order to draw attention to his
message. He preached very strong law and Gospel – warning people to receive the forgiveness
the Messiah offered through repentance and faith, lest they be cut down by his justice and thrown
into the unquenchable fires of hell.
His bold preaching got himself thrown into jail. And there he sat – waiting for the Messiah to
bring about the justice the Old Testament Scriptures promised he would bring.
But John’s disciples brought back confusing reports about Jesus. Some wondered why he and
his disciples didn’t fast like they did. Others wondered why he was willing to associate with
public sinners, tax collectors and even the odd Gentile. Jesus gives us some insight as to what
people thought about him, when he said, “The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they
say, 'Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and ""sinners.”iii
And there sat poor John in prison, neither able to verify nor explain the reports he heard. Can
you imagine how the devil must have tempted him? “The Scriptures say that the Messiah is
going to judge the world with justice in order to bring relief to the oppressed. If Jesus is the
Messiah, why are you sitting here in prison – oppressed? Are you sure you put your faith in the
right guy?”
Yes, in prison poor John sat – unable to see and hear Jesus himself. His faith was under attack.
What would he do? The only thing He could: send some of his disciples straight to the source!
He asked Jesus to reassure him that he is the Messiah.
Some people think that John’s sending of his disciples to ask Jesus this question was a sign of
weakness, doubt, and possibly of a loss of faith. No! John’s actions were a sign of strength,
confidence and doing the right thing. Oh, that all believers would do what John did! Instead of
speculating and trying to figure out things on his own, John rightly let Jesus himself drive his
doubts away. Yes, sending his disciples to Jesus was an act of faith, because Jesus' words would
settle the matter for John.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, when Satan attacks your faith – tempting you to wonder whether
or not God really cares or exists with all the hatred, sorrow, crime and injustice in the world -
don’t try to tough these temptations out. If John, the greatest (human) prophet ever born, knew
that he couldn’t overcome temptation on his own, what makes you think you can? No, do as
John did: go to God in prayer – asking him to reassure you of his power, presence and love.
Read the Bible and let God himself settle the matter for you in His Word. 
Jesus addresses John’s concerns by telling his disciples: “Go, report to John what you hear and
see: 5The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the
dead are raised, and the gospel is preached to the poor.
Instead of just saying, “Yes, I am the Messiah,” Jesus let John’s disciples experience this truth
for themselves. By inviting them to report back what they saw and heard, Jesus led them to see
how his miracles, his preaching and the Old Testament Scriptures all proved that He was the
Messiah. Yes, John was right to expect Jesus to judge the world with justice, but that day of
judgement lay in the future. Right now Jesus was fulfilling his other work of bringing comfort,
healing and salvation through his Gospel ministry – the culmination of which would be the
sacrifice of himself on the cross for the forgiveness of our sins so that, whoever repents and
believes in him might have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn
the world, but to save the world through him.iv
Jesus says: 6Blessed is the one who does not take offense at me.” This is like saying: Blessed is
the man who doesn’t have false expectations about me, but allows the Holy Spirit to teach him
through Scripture.
Part 2: Listen to His Servant, who uses His Word
7As these two were leaving, Jesus began to talk to the crowds about John. “What did you go out
into the wilderness to see?
This is a very profound question. What did the people expect to hear and see when they went to
see John the Baptist? And we should ask ourselves the same question: What do we expect to
hear and see when we come to worship to listen to our pastor preach?
Do you expect to see a reed shaken by the wind – that is, someone who only tells us what we
want to hear: that you are a basically good person who doesn’t have to worry about sinning – that
all you have to do is believe in yourself and do what feels good for you?
8What did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? In other words, do you go to church
merely to be entertained with a flashy show, upbeat music and a self-affirming message? No,
those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses. That is to say: true ministers of the Gospel,
like John the Baptist are not entertainers. You don’t go to them for a show.
Jesus asks: 9
So what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you! And he is much more than
a prophet. 10This is the one about whom it is written, ‘Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of
you, who will prepare your way before you.’ 11Amen I tell you: Among those born of women
there has not appeared anyone greater than John the Baptist.
According to Jesus, John the Baptist wasn’t just any old prophet: he was the Messiah’s special
forerunner. And did you know that, other than Jesus, John is the only other prophet prophesied
about in Scripture? Therefore, it’s of the utmost importance that we take special note of John’s
message, even today! Why? Because his message is still relevant – especially in view of Jesus’ 
return. The preparations the Jews needed to make for the Messiah’s first coming are no different
than the preparations God wants us to make for his second coming.
And what is John’s message for us today? It’s the same message that has been preached from
every faithful pulpit since Pentecost: ""Repent, (that is: turn away from sin and to your Savior) for
the kingdom of heaven is near.""v
 He points to Jesus and says: “Look, the Lamb of God, who
takes away the sin of the world!”vi Repent of your transgressions and follow him in faith for he
has come to forgive all your sins. But watch out if you refuse to repent: for he is the promised
Messiah who will judge the nations with justice. 10 The ax is already at the root of the trees,
and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.vii
Yes, all that John says about Jesus is true, and we are not to neglect any part of his message!
God wants us to have a proper expectation of who Jesus is: both regarding his law as well as his
Gospel.
Sadly there are many people who focus so much on the gracious love God has for us poor sinners
in Christ and they begin to falsely assert that God’s law has no place in our preaching. They
falsely suppose that Jesus didn’t just save us from our sins, but also excuses our pursuit of them.
Such people reason: “God is love and accepts us for who we are. He wants us to be happy in
life, therefore I can pursue ungodly relationships and do whatever else my heart desires.” And
aren’t we often tempted to think the same? Don’t we also excuse sinning with the thought that
Christ will forgive me in the end? Oh how we cheapen his grace and love when we do that!
How low our expectations of the Christ become. Jesus was not born to be our buddy. He was
born to be our Savior. He is our God.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: as you prepare to celebrate Christmas – don’t let your hearts be
filled with false expectation as to who Jesus is and what he came to do. Make every effort to
listen to the Scriptures tell you exactly who Jesus is and why we can rejoice in him. He is the
Savior, the perfect Lamb of God who offered himself up for the sins of the world. He is our
righteous LORD who will come again at the end of time to judge the world with equity. All who
repentantly put their trust in him will receive eternal life – all because of what he came to
accomplish the first time He made himself known on this earth.
This is what Christmas is all really all about. Amen. ",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/11/2016,
"Part One: Understand what the Kingdom of Heaven is.
I don’t know about you, but every time I hear the word “kingdom,” I immediately think of a
medieval castle in some European country ruled by a king. Is this what the LORD wants us to
think about when we hear John the Baptist proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is near? Not
exactly.
You see, even though the original Greek word translated as “kingdom” in our text can refer to a
geographical place, it also refers to a king’s ruling activity: his reign, so to speak. Therefore,
whenever you see the phrase “kingdom of God” or “kingdom of heaven” in the New Testament,
you should think about God’s ruling activity over his people.
The LORD created Adam and Eve perfect and holy. Before the fall into sin, they were members
of God’s “kingdom,” who willingly submitted to God’s reign by obeying his one command: Don’t
eat the fruit from the tree in the middle of the Garden. Sadly, when Satan suggested to Adam and
Eve that God was holding out on them - they ate the forbidden fruit. This was an act of unbelief
and rebellion against the LORD’s gracious reign. This act separated both them and their offspring
from God because every child after them would inherit the sinful nature with which they rebelled
against the LORD.
Flesh gives birth to flesh, the Scriptures say. This means that we too have inherited the sinful
nature with which Adam and Eve rebelled against the LORD. We were born outside of God’s
Kingdom - enslaved to sin and the devil. Like Adam and Eve, we pursue our own will instead of
the LORD’s. This makes us God’s enemies. And what do earthly kings do with rebellious
enemies? They put them to death! And so we too lived under the threat of God’s eternal
punishment.
But the LORD did not want us lost. For some reason that human reason will never be able to
comprehend, the LORD pitied us to such a degree, that he took it upon himself to restore our
broken relationship with him by sending his divine Son into the world to become human - just like
us. As true God and true man, Jesus would live the life of perfect obedience to God’s law that we
all failed to live. He would take our sins upon himself in order to suffer the just punishment we
deserved. By doing these things, Jesus would reconcile us to God so that we might once again be
considered citizens of his heavenly kingdom – living at peace with him under his gracious rule.
So, when John the Baptist proclaimed: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near,” he was telling
his listeners that the promised Messiah would soon restore their fallen relationship with God. The
promised Christ was near - ready to forgive all sin and to rule in the hearts of all who receive him
in faith - granting them the wonderful, free gifts of forgiveness, eternal life and salvation.
Jesus, the almighty king of heaven and earth, was already living in the land when John the Baptist
proclaimed the nearness of his kingdom. But what about today? Is Christ near us today – ready
to rule in our hearts?
Yes, he most certainly is! Where is he, then? He is wherever his Word and Sacraments are
preached and administered in all truth and purity. Through these wonderful means of grace the
Holy Spirit washes us clean from all sin by connecting us to Christ and the sacrifice he made for
our sins on the cross. Through these wonderful means of grace, the Holy Spirit both creates and
strengthens our faith in Christ so that we might live under him in his kingdom, and serve him in
all righteousness, innocence and blessedness – both now and forever in heaven.
Part Two: Understand how repentance prepares you for it.
Repent, because the kingdom of heaven is near! Now that we know what the kingdom of heaven
is, let us learn what repentance is and why it’s important.
The Augsburg confession says: 3 Now, strictly speaking, repentance consists of two parts. 4 One
part is contrition, that is, terrors striking the conscience through the knowledge of sin. 5 The other
part is faith, which is born of the Gospel [Romans 10:17] or the Absolution and believes that for
Christ’s sake, sins are forgiven. It comforts the conscience and delivers it from terror. 6 Then good
works are bound to follow, which are the fruit of repentance [Galatians 5:22–23].
The Greek word translated as repent literally means “to change your mind.” The idea is that those
who once loved sin and hated God are changed to hating sin and loving God. But what could
possibly bring about such a 180 degree change in a person’s heart? Only the Holy Spirit working
through the Word!
You see, we sinful human beings are born with a corrupt spirit. We like to think that we know
what’s best for us, and that we are generally good people, who can earn our own way to heaven;
but nothing could be further from the truth.
The Bible reveals that we are totally corrupt: that every inclination of the thoughts of our hearts is
only evil.iii
 Now I know that nobody likes to think that about himself, but that is the truth. And
the more time we spend in God’s holy law – meditating on his commandments – the more we see
this truth. God demands that we love and yet how often don’t we hate? God demands that we
build others up and yet how often don’t we tear them down? God demands that we help others,
and yet how often don’t we take advantage of them? God demands that we love him above all
else, and yet how often don’t we refuse to listen to him – putting other people and things ahead of
him. This list can go on and on!
The more we honestly meditate on God’s Law, the more we have to acknowledge that outside of
Christ, we are utterly corrupt and helplessly lost to selfishness and sin.
But there is good news. Jesus came to save us from our corruption. Through his sacrifice on the
cross he paid for our sins in full. Through his resurrection he shows that God has accepted his
payment. Through faith in him we not only receive his forgiveness, but the Holy Spirit also creates
a new man inside of us: one that wants to please and honor the LORD – not out of fear of
punishment, but out of love for the one who suffered and died in order to save us.
Repent, therefore, because the kingdom of heaven is near! Understand from God’s Word how
selfishly pursuing sin will only lead to your destruction! See also how God wants to rescue you
from that destruction: how he paid for your sins in full and is willing to forgive you. Repent,
therefore, by confessing your sins to God with genuine remorse. That’s the first part of repentance.
The second part is just as important: trust that God has forgiven your sins for Christ’s sake. The
LORD has restored your relationship with him so that he might rule over your heart by means of
the Gospel.
Now that we know what repentance is, why is it important? Because without repentance there can
be no forgiveness. Why is that? Because if we refuse to repent, we show ourselves to be the rebels
Adam and Eve became when they fell into sin – distrusting of God and unwilling to submit to his
rule over our hearts. By refusing to repent we in effect tell God that we don’t care about him, his
will, or anything he did to save us. We don’t want him as our God because we love our sins more
than him.
But when we repent – confessing our sins with genuine remorse and trusting in Christ’s power and
mercy to forgive – then He comes into our hearts, washes us clean and reigns in us by the power
of his Word. And we are changed. How so? Because a new king rules over our heart: Jesus Christ
himself. By the power of the Holy Spirit, he awakens new desires and attitudes inside of us. We
no longer want to live for ourselves, but for him who saved us. We no longer want to take
advantage of our fellow man, but help him any way we can – reflecting the same love towards him
that Christ had for us. Instead of living in fear and hostility, we live in hope and love – trusting
that God will keep his promise to deliver us.
Now this is not to say that we won’t still struggle with selfish, sinful thoughts and desires. Because
of the sinful nature that lives inside of us, we will struggle with these things until the day we die.
But, compelled by the Spirit working through his Word, we can always turn to Christ in repentance
– trusting that He will answer our prayers to both forgive us and rule in our hearts by the power of
His Gospel.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: now that your know what the Kingdom of God is and how
repentance prepares you for it, heed John the Baptist's call to repent – knowing that the kingdom
of God is near. Live in a constant state of turning away from sin and to Christ in faith and love.
Then Christ will rule in your heart – safely delivering you from all your enemies until he brings
you home to himself in heaven. Amen.
",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/4/2016,
"The leaves have fallen off the trees and the days are much shorter and colder – all of which
signals a change in the seasons. Even though there isn’t any accumulating snow in the forecast
we all know that a freak winter storm could pop up at any time. Massive snow storms are
coming, we just don’t know when. So have you gotten your house, yard, vehicles and self
prepared for winter yet?
Let me ask you another question: are you prepared for Christ’s return. Like the change of the
seasons, we are surrounded by the signs of his coming. Like a freak, winter storm, his coming
will be sudden and shocking. Are you prepared for it, or are you waiting until the last minute to
try to “beat the storm”? The problem with waiting until the last minute is that, more likely than
not, you will be caught unprepared.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, you do not want to be caught unprepared at Christ’s return. The
consequences are eternally devastating. This is why Jesus urges us to be Alert . . . 1) Against
indifference. 2) Against unbelief. 3) Against carelessness.
Part One: Against indifference.
Our sermon text is part of a larger discourse Jesus gave his disciples concerning both the
destruction of Jerusalem and the end of the world. After describing the signs of his second 
coming – and encouraging us to interpret them as we would interpret the seasonal signs of nature
– Jesus goes on to say:
36“No one knows when that day and hour will be, not the angels of heaven, not even the Son, but
only the Father.
Just as no one can accurately predict when a tornado will form or exactly where it will strike, so
no one can accurately predict when Christ will come. It is foolish to even try. All we have are
the signs that this storm is coming. Every moment that passes is a moment that brings us closer
to the end.
Jesus says: 37Just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man returns.
What were the days of Noah like before the flood? Genesis 6 describes the earth as being
wicked. Believers married unbelievers resulting in a great falling away from faith in God.
People did whatever they wanted to do with no regrets. They refused to repent of their sins and
turn back to the LORD.
Does any of this sound familiar? Our society is growing ever more intolerant of the Gospel. It
either ignores what the Bible says about sin or mocks it. People follow their own unbridled
passions – doing everything they can to twist, change or destroy God’s Word. And many
Christians – especially the young and inexperienced - are falling away. Doesn’t today’s world
sound a lot like Noah’s?
Noah, being a man of faith, did all he could to confess the truth – calling the people of his age to
repentance and faith! And how did his world receive his urgent, heartfelt warnings? Jesus tells
us:
38In fact, in the days before the flood people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in
marriage, until the very day that Noah entered the ark. 39And they did not realize what was
coming until the flood came and took them all away.
In other words, people ignored Noah’s warning. They just continued going about their daily
lives without making any changes. They met Noah’s preaching with cold indifference – refusing
to either repent or acknowledge that anything was wrong until it was too late.
Jesus says: That is how it will be when the Son of Man returns. Most people will just go about
their daily lives as if there was nothing to be concerned about at all.
And doesn’t that sound like the world we live in today? The people of this world don’t seem to
care what the Bible says about their sins and need for forgiveness. They often meet
Christianity’s loving call to repentance with cold indifference. They just want to live their lives
without anyone or anything making them feel guilty for the choices they make.
But what about you: do you care what God says about sin and that, according to his law, you
deserve his eternal wrath and punishment? Do you care that Jesus loved you so much that he 
died for your sins on the cross so that you might be forgiven? Do you care that God the Father
sent the Holy Spirit to work repentance in your heart so that, having received the forgiveness
Jesus won for you through faith, you might become a child of God and heir of heaven? Do you
care that Christ will soon return to both judge the world for its wickedness and deliver believers
to eternal life with him in paradise? I sure hope you care about these things: for they are the very
teachings through which Christ prepares us for his return.
Be alert against indifference towards the Gospel. Spend time in God’s Word reflecting on both
your need for forgiveness and the lengths Jesus went through to save you. By doing this your
faith in Christ will increase and you will be prepared to receive Jesus when the end actually
comes.
Part Two: Against unbelief
Jesus continues: 40“At that time two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be
left. 41Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left.
Can you tell the difference between a believer and an unbeliever just by looking at them? I
certainly can’t; but Christ can. And he will reveal this distinction when He comes again on the
last day.
Two men are in the field. Outwardly they look the same. Both seem morally upright. On the
Last Day, however, only one of them will be taken to God’s side. The other will be left for
judgment. Why? Because one believed and the other didn’t.
Two women are grinding at the mill. To our human eyes these women are equal: the one seems
just as righteous as the other. But only one of them is received by God. Why? Because only the
one had faith.
“ So be alert,” Jesus says, “because you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.” What
should we be looking out for? The unbelief that so easily creeps into a person’s heart and
corrupts it.
“But pastor,” someone might say, “you don’t have to worry about me. I’m a member of your
church. Doesn’t this fact prove that I’m a believer?” Oh, how I wish that were true! Sadly it
doesn’t: a person can easily be an active, lifelong member of a church and still not believe!
Want proof? Look no further than Jesus' handpicked disciples. Were all 12 of them believers?
Judas sure wasn’t. Could the other disciples tell that he was not a believer before his betrayal?
No they couldn’t. Why not? Because, humanly speaking, he was just like the other disciples.
He heard the same sermons they heard and followed Jesus just like they did. He engaged in the
same ministry they engaged in. He gave nobody any reason to suspect that he was anything but
a disciple of Christ. But Jesus knew the truth. He saw into Judas’ heart.
This, then, is the point of Jesus’ illustration of the two men in the field and two women at the
mill: we can’t tell who is or isn’t a believer. Only God knows those who are is. 
Now, Jesus did not tell us these thing so that we can look around our church wondering who is
and isn’t a believer. To do so would be foolish and wrong. Rather, having heard His warning,
God wants you to examine your own hearts. What do you believe about Christ? Do you confess
that you are sinful and need a Savior? Do you trust that Jesus is the divine Savior God sent to
save you from your sins? Do you truly repent of your sins trusting that God forgives you for
Christ’s sake?
By asking ourselves these kinds of questions we can examine ourselves and address any unbelief
lurking within our hearts. And why would we want to do that? Because unbelief is like a
cancer: left unchecked, it can spread and destroy a person. Thankfully the Gospel remedies this
kind of spiritual cancer – keeping our faith alive as we patiently wait for Christ’s return.
Part Three: Against carelessness
Jesus continues: 43But understand this: If the master of the house had known at what time of
night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house to be
broken into. 44You also need to be ready for this reason: The Son of Man is coming at an hour
when you do not expect him.”
I can really relate to Jesus’ illustration. When I first became a pastor, I lived a couple miles
away from the Church I served in Milwaukee. I had to pick up my Mom from the airport one
Saturday night. We got home very late and, after getting my Mom settled, I immediately got
ready for bed. On my way to bed, my Mom asked me: “Did you put the Club on the car?” (You
remember the Club, don’t you? It was a large, locking device you put on the steering wheel to
keep a car from getting stolen.) “No, I forgot,” I said. “You better do it,” my Mom warned.
“It’s really, really late and I’m all ready for bed,” I replied, “Besides, the car is parked on a busy
street right in front of my house. No one will steal it tonight.”
When I got up for church the next morning, guess what I saw when I looked out my front
window? A pile of broken glass where my car used to be only a few hours earlier!
“It won’t happen to me tonight. . .” those are some famous last words! I had faithfully put my
club on my car every single night up until the night it got stolen. One act of false security and
carelessness cost me my car. Don’t let it cost you your salvation!
What I mean is this: Jesus tells us that his coming will be like that of a thief’s: sudden and when
we least expect it. Therefore don’t be careless with your salvation. Don’t live in sin, thinking
you have time to repent of your guilty pleasures. Do not be careless with the Gospel, treating
your relationship with God as something you’ll take more seriously later on, after you get your
life set up the way you want it to be set up.
Jesus said he’s coming soon - like a thief, when we least expect it. The signs heralding his return
have all been fulfilled. Every tick of the second hand is a tick closer to our Savior’s coming. 
Don’t be caught unprepared for his arrival – living in unrepented sin and unbelief. All who live
like that will be cursed to the eternal fires of hell together with the devil and all his evil angels.
However, all who – through repentance and faith – look to Jesus for the forgiveness of sins will
be saved. Christ’s return will be a blessing for them, because they will be welcomed to His side
to live with him in the perfect paradise he has prepared for them from before the creation of the
world.
Please understand that the LORD takes no pleasure in the eternal destruction of anyone. He
wants all people to be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth. This is why he sent Jesus to
suffer and die for the sins of the world. This is why he sends out pastors, missionaries and other
faithful Christian evangelists: so people might repent of their sins, believe in him and be saved.
So, stay spiritually alert – always prepared for Christ’s return. Then the day of Jesus’ second
coming will not be a day to fear, but a day to look forward to with joy because you will know
that when Jesus comes again, he is coming with the eternal reward he won for you on his cross.
Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",11/27/2016,
"Today is a special day. Our culture encourages us to take a step back from all our labor in order
to give thanks for all that we have. And we certainly have a lot to be thankful for, don’t we?
Food, shelter, clothing, running water, electricity, cars, computers, and cell phones. . . Compared
with our forefathers, we certainly have a lot of physical blessings.
But whom should we thank for them? The obvious answer is God, right? Well, that answer may
be obvious to us, but it isn’t obvious to all! Our society likes to think that it has itself to thank for
all that it enjoys? I mean, didn’t we learn at school that the USA is a country in which any person
can attain his dreams through hard work and determination? As we consider all our earthly
blessings, shouldn’t we, then, at least give ourselves a little pat on the back and say: “You earned
this, buddy. You did good”?
No we shouldn’t. And why not? Because we would then be stealing the honor that belongs to
God alone.
With our sermon text as our guide, let us learn to give God the glory that he is due, under the
theme: Don’t Forget the LORD. . . 1) He blesses us with prosperity. 2) He delivers us through
every trial. 3) He keeps his promises
Part One: He blesses us with prosperity.
Our sermon text is part of a longer sermon Moses gave the Israelites as they were about to enter
the promised land of Canaan – a land flowing with milk and honey. Their 40 years of
homelessness, severe trial and tribulation were about to come to an end. Now they would enjoy
the prosperity God promised: in their own houses, on their own land, with their own flocks and
herds!
And why would the LORD give the Israelites all these blessings? So that he might be glorified as
a God who keeps his promises and delivers his people, as the first verse of our text indicates:
10Then you will eat, and you will be filled, and you will praise the LORD your God for the good
land that he has given you.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: why has God given you all your wealth and prosperity? The first
verse of our text tells us: it’s so that you can praise the LORD, your God. Yes, the LORD is your
God, who loved you so much that he sent His one and only Son to suffer and die for your sins. He
loves you so much that he called you to repentance and faith by means of His Gospel – making
you his child through Holy Baptism. He has promised to watch over every aspect of your life, and
the prosperity you enjoy is proof of this fact.
But there is also a danger in the prosperity he provides. Moses warns:
11Be very careful so that you do not forget the LORD your God by not keeping his commandments
and ordinances and his statutes that I am commanding you today. 12When you eat and are satisfied,
and you build nice houses and move into them, 13and your herds and your flocks multiply, and
your silver and gold increase, and everything that you have prospers, 14watch out so that your
heart does not become arrogant and forget the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt, where you were slaves.
Israel’s history often played this sad truth out: whenever the LORD allowed his people to prosper,
they soon began to forget him. It’s interesting to note that many Old Testament prophets did not
minister during times of national want, but during times of national prosperity - calling God’s
people to repent of their arrogance, selfishness and idolatry.
Is it any different today? The LORD has allowed many western nations, in which Christianity
once thrived, to become very prosperous. But look at what has happened: Christianity is declining
in those nations. People have become arrogant – thinking that they have no need to follow the 
Bible. Why not? Because all is well. Why would they need a Savior when life is so good? They
say: “Where is this “god” who supposedly provides for all our needs. We don’t see him. Our
human intelligence, work ethic and entrepreneurship have accomplished all we have.”
We Christians might think we would never be so crass to say things like that, and yet aren’t we
also tempted to view all the stuff we own as stuff we deserve – stuff we worked hard to get? Aren’t
we also tempted to mindlessly cling to all our physical blessings – forgetting the LORD and the
eternal life he has prepared for us in Christ?
Yes, there is great danger in great wealth. So, then, how should we view our prosperity? Should
we be afraid of it – considering it more of a curse than a blessing? Should we give all our wealth
away in order to live a more austere life? No – that’s not what the LORD wants us to do. The
LORD gave us our wealth as a blessing – to be used to the glory of his name. Therefore He wants
us to enjoy the prosperity he has given us with thanksgiving. He wants us to grow in love and
faith towards him - considering how he keeps his promise to work in all things for our eternal
good.
Part Two: He delivers us through every trial.
Moses continues:
15Do not forget the LORD, who led you in the great and terrifying wilderness, where there were
venomous snakes and scorpions, where the thirsty ground had no water, but the LORD made water
come out of a flint rock for you. 16Do not forget the LORD, who in the wilderness fed you manna,
which your fathers had not known before, to humble you and to test you so that it would be good
for you later on.
Life for the Israelites wasn’t always easy. The LORD allowed them to face a lot of severe trials
during their 40-year desert journey: deadly animals, powerful enemies, hunger and thirst. And yet
look: the LORD miraculously delivered them through it all. He gave them the food, drink and
protection they needed. He kept his promise to watch over them in every evil in order to safely
deliver them to the land he wanted them to have.
The LORD wanted the Israelites to remember how he kept his promises in times of severe trial.
Every bad thing they experienced served their deliverance and good. He wanted them to grow in
faith – realizing that, without his gracious love and deliverance, they would most certainly be lost.
What was true for the Israelites is also true for us. The LORD has been with us throughout our
lives – keeping his promises. Has there ever been a time you lacked food or drink as you held on
to him in faith? Has there ever been a time he failed to provide for your bodily needs? The fact
that you are here today shows the answer. 
Now, the LORD certainly may have allowed severe trials in your life, but you can know for certain
that whatever he allowed, he allowed for your good; that it would, somehow and in some way,
benefit your faith by leading you to cling all the more closely to Christ.
So, as you give thanks today for all the blessings you have received from the LORD, don’t forget
to consider his hand in all the trials you faced – how he kept his promise to deliver you through
them all. You can be sure that he will continue to watch over you in every trial you may face in
the future. He will use them to strengthen you and as he keeps his promise to lead you to your
promised land of heaven. How can you be sure of this? Because God always keeps his promises.
Part Three: He keeps his promises
Moses continues:
17You might say in your heart, “My ability and the power of my hand have earned this wealth for
me.” 18But then you are to remember that the LORD your God is the one who gives you the ability
to produce wealth, to confirm his covenant that he promised to your fathers with an oath, as he
does to this day.
Our LORD is gracious. The only reason anyone is successful is because He allows it. The only
reason our age has seemed to advance more quickly than other ages of history in the areas of
science, medicine and technology is because the LORD has given our society the abilities and
wisdom to do so. He knows that our world needs these advancements to feed, clothe and sustain
the billions of people that presently live on this earth. Though people do the work, none of their
striving and labor would achieve anything without the LORD keeping his promise to provide for
all people during their time of grace on this earth.
And what the LORD does for the world in general, he also does more specifically for us.
Everything you have and are is a result of God’s love for you in Christ. He has poured out all His
blessings upon you in keeping with His promises. This is why you never have to fear tough times
because you can be confident that he will be with you – giving you the abilities and tools you need
to glorify his name on this earth until he brings all of us to the eternal paradise he promised to give
us in Christ.
You see our present, prosperous life, with all its glitz and glitter, is not the Promised Land to which
we are journeying. It is merely an oasis on the way. The real Promised Land is yet to come, where
we will enjoy God’s unending presence and glory for all eternity. We can be certain that God will
keep his promise to bring us there because he has already given up his one and only Son to pay for
all our sins in full. If he did that for us, how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us
all things? (Romans 8:32 NIV84)
Brothers and sisters in Christ, as you spend time today looking over all your blessings, don’t forget
the LORD. Don’t let your prosperity blind you from seeing your need for him. He loves you. He
wants you to be faithful to him – not only thanking him today, but every day as you remember his
faithfulness to you. Don’t forget the LORD. He has blessed you with your prosperity. He has
delivered you through every trial. He always keeps his promises. As you hold on to him in faith,
will deliver you safely to heaven.
Therefore, as you eat your Thanksgiving dinner today, enjoying your family, friends and
prosperity, don’t forget the LORD. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",11/24/2016,
"There certainly seems to be a lot of fear and uncertainty in the world today. There are protests
over here and shootings over there. Various dictators are threatening war. Our society seems to
have thrown the virtues of civility and common courtesy to the wayside. In many places
Christianity is being persecuted worse than ever before, and great numbers of people are falling
away from the Christian faith.
All these things are signs that the end is near, as Jesus once predicted: “ 6 You will hear of wars
and rumors of wars. . .
7 Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.. 9
. . .you
will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death, and you will be hated by all nations
because of me. 10 At that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each
other . . . 12 Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, 13 but he who
stands firm to the end will be saved.i
Yes, everything that is happening in the world today testifies that the end is coming soon. But
what should we do about it? Should we try to hide our faith in the world so that no one bothers
us? Should we worry about every bad news story we hear and live our lives in fear? No, this is
not what our Savior wants our reaction to be. Rather, he wants us to lift our heads, redouble our
evangelism efforts, and look forward to his coming at the End of Time.
And why should we do that? Because God promises to raise the dead on the last day and deliver
believers to a wonderful, new paradise where all the evils of this present age will no longer affect
us.
When faced with the many problems, concerns and temptations that come into our life on this
evil earth, the LORD wants us to lift our eyes to him and find comfort in his promised salvation.
With the prophet Isaiah as our guide, let us listen to the LORD describe our future home under
the theme: Imagine what eternal life with God will be like. There will be: 1) unending joy, 2)
no curse of sin, 3) perfect peace.
Part One: There will be unending joy.
Our text begins with the LORD making a wonderful promise to all his faithful followers who
face all sorts of problems on this evil earth. It’s as if he is saying: “Don’t be afraid. Don’t
despair. Trust in me. Look at what I am doing.”
Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth.
The Bible says that, when Christ comes again, our current earth will be destroyed.
ii God will
create a new home for us out of its ashes. That new home will be similar to the Garden of Eden
before Adam and Eve fell into sin. There will be no suffering or death on that new earth –
nothing that would ever cause us any heartache or pain.
The LORD says:
The former things will not be remembered, nor will they come to mind.
Does this mean that believers will forget everything they ever did while living on this earth? Not
necessarily. What it means, rather, is that if we have memories of our past, they will not bring us
any sorrow or pain. Why is that? Because Christ’s atoning sacrifice for us on the cross has paid
for our sins in full. The forgiveness and peaceful conscience we possess now by faith, we will
have in all fullness after Christ returns. Our sinful nature will be gone for good. Our
consciences will be absolutely clean before God with no regrets or thinking of past sins with
horror. Our focus will be completely on the LORD and His great love for us.
18 But be glad and rejoice forever in what I will create, for I will create Jerusalem to be a delight
and its people a joy. 19 I will rejoice over Jerusalem and take delight in my people; the sound of
weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more.
God promises that believers (who are pictured as Jerusalem in this text) will always be happy.
O, I can’t tell you how I look forward to that reality! Let me explain why.
Have you ever battled with any sort of depression? It stinks. You have this constant sadness and
anxiety inside of you that just makes you want to curl up in a ball and cry. You feel drained of 
all energy and want to avoid all contact with others. You feel helpless, worthless, and like a total
failure. You might even be tempted to wonder how God could ever love you.
But look at what God promises: a place where there will be no crying, sorrow, worry or
depression, but only joy forever. Imagine what that will be like: always having a smile on your
face and feeling good all the time. And that is what we will experience in heaven, all because of
the saving love God has for us in Christ.
Yes, whenever you are tempted to feel depressed, let yourself be comforted with the paradise
God is preparing to give you on the last day. Imagine what it will be like – living with God in
unending joy. This will be your reality as you hold on to Jesus in faith. How do I know?
Because God loved you so much that he gave up his one and only Son to save you from your
sins.iii
 The Bible says so much. Let this truth sustain you through every dark, hopeless period in
life: Jesus is coming again soon to take sins curse away from you, so you can live in unending
joy.
Part Two: There will be no curse of sin
What will the new heaven and earth be like? Knowing that our human minds can’t even begin to
comprehend the joy that awaits us there, God uses a series of understatements to describe it -
focusing our attention on how sin’s curse will be removed.
He says:
20 ""Never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days, or an old man who does not
live out his years; he who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere youth; he who fails to reach a
hundred will be considered accursed.
The Bible is clear: wherever there is sin, there will be death. The two go hand and hand. The
fact that youth and infants die on this earth, shows how deeply sin has corrupted our world.
But can you imagine a world in which no mother has a miscarriage and no father will ever have
to bury his child? Can you imagine a world in which you call a 100 year old person a youth, and
whose death (if he were even able to die) would be considered a great tragedy and curse because
he died so young? That’s what life on God’s new earth will be like. People will live forever and
never die. Why? Because sin’s curse will be removed forever. And where there is no sin, there
can be no death.
21 They will build houses and dwell in them; they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit. 22 No
longer will they build houses and others live in them, or plant and others eat.
The people who lived in ancient Israel lived in fear. They were tormented by foreign raiders
who would ruin and steal anything the Israelites planted or built. How the people prayed for
relief!
But God promises a future where we won’t have to cry out for His relief because we will already
have it. No one will be allowed to take away the blessings God gives us, or prevent us from
having joy in them. All the dangers and frustrations we have in this present world will be gone.
For as the days of a tree, so will be the days of my people; my chosen ones will long enjoy the
works of their hands. 23 They will not toil in vain or bear children doomed to misfortune; for
they will be a people blessed by the LORD, they and their descendants with them.
Did you know that there are trees alive today that seem to have germinated thousands of years
ago - shortly after the flood? Those trees seem to have lived forever! When Christ delivers us to
his new earth, we will live forever - enjoying all the blessings he gives us. There will be no toil,
labor or frustration – no sorrow or misfortune. All those things will be replaced with peace,
security, joy and satisfaction in all we do. Why? Because sin’s curse is gone. We will be a
people blessed by the LORD – holy, precious and loved. All the evil we experience on this earth
will be removed forever, and we will live with God in perfect peace.
Part 3: There will be perfect peace
24 Before they call I will answer; while they are still speaking I will hear.
On this earth, the LORD doesn’t always answer our prayer right away. He makes us wait
patiently for his answer in order to strengthen our faith. And that waiting is often hard.
Can you imagine what it would be like if God answered our prayers, even before we got to
Amen? Talk about comfort and assurance – never having to wonder or worry how He will
answer our requests! This is exactly what God promises to do on the new heavens and new
earth. He will immediately give us everything we ask for in prayer. Why? Because we are his
dearly loved children – who will be living in all holiness and righteousness with him in paradise.
We will be at peace.
25 The wolf and the lamb will feed together, and the lion will eat straw like the ox, but dust will
be the serpent's food. They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain,"" says the
LORD.
Can you imagine a world in which predators and prey actually got along? That’s what God’s
new heavens and earth will be like. Rich or poor, young or old, black or white, male or female,
republican or democrat: we will all get along in perfect peace and harmony in God’s kingdom.
Why? Because when Christ comes on the last day, he will remove the sin that keeps mankind
divided. All fear and suspicion will be taken away. Believers from every corner of the globe
will be united in peace. Every living creature will live in perfect harmony with us and each
other. None will kill and eat the other. They will all eat the vegetation God provides – except
the snake.
And why is that? Probably as a reminder of what happened on this earth when the devil tempted
Adam and Eve into sin. When God cursed the snake he also made a promise that a special 
descendant of Adam and Eve, would restore the relationship they lost with God when they fell
into sin. The snake’s continuous humiliation would serve as reminder of that promise, and of the
Savior who fulfilled it!
Yes, because Jesus died on the cross for our sins we can stand before God free, forgiven and
righteous through faith in him. We are no longer slaves of the devil, but children of God –
children who will live in perfect peace with God and each other when Christ comes again on the
Last Day.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, we are living in dark and dangerous times. We are constantly
being tempted to give up our faith. How are we to face and overcome all the trials we face in
life? By remembering Christ and the wonderful paradise he won for us through his life, death
and resurrection.
Imagine what it will be like living in unending joy, facing no curse or consequence of sin, and
living in perfect peace and harmony with God and each other forever. Let those thoughts
strengthen you as you look forward to Christ’s return, remembering what the apostle John wrote:
20 He who testifies to these things says, ""Yes, I am coming soon."" Amen. Come, Lord Jesus . 21
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people. Amen.
",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",11/13/2016,
"What will you say when the almighty God asks you on Judgement Day what you did with
the treasure He entrusted to your care? “Treasure?” you might ask, “What treasure?”
Don’t you know about the treasure God has given you? I’ll give you a little hint as to
what it is: it’s the only thing that offers you true forgiveness, life and salvation. The
treasure is His Gospel in Word and Sacrament.
Our sermon text for today is a parable Jesus once told, urging us to faithfully use his
Gospel. Let’s meditate on his instruction, under the theme: Be faithful stewards of the
King’s mina because 1) the king commands faithful stewardship, 2) he rewards faithful
stewardship, and 3) he will condemn unfaithful stewardship
Part One: The King commands faithful stewardship
12 [Jesus] said: A man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed
king and then to return.
Jesus is the man of noble birth, who (at his ascension) went off to the far country of
heaven to be appointed as king - ruling over everything on behalf of God the Father.
So he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas.
A mina was the equivalent of what a common laborer would make in 3 months. Money,
however, is not the point of the parable. In Scripture the number “10” usually represents
completeness. The 10 minas and 10 servants, therefore, represent the complete treasure
of the Gospel, which God has entrusted to all believers.
‘Put this money to work,’ he said, ‘until I come back.’
The king's command to put His money to work is similar to the command Jesus gave to
all his disciples at his ascension regarding the Gospel: Go and make disciples of all
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.” (Matthew 28:19-20
NIV84)
In other words, Jesus didn’t just give us his Gospel so that we can feel good about our
future and live our lives however we want. No, he entrusted the Gospel to us so that we
might put it to work, so that it might earn more souls for heaven. Yes, our duty as
servants of Jesus is to invest God’s Word; but how do we do that? The answer is quite
easy: we invest the Gospel by simply confessing it to others.
Now it stands to reason that we need to know what God’s Word says before we can
confess it. Our first priority, therefore, is to study the Bible: for both the strengthening of
our own faith, and for the ability to call others to repent and believe in Jesus for salvation.
You see, an amazing thing happens when we study God's Word: the Holy Spirit awakens
a desire in us to tell others the good news of God's forgiving love. The more we meditate
on the meaning of Christ's cross, the more courageous we become in sharing this lifesaving
Gospel. We don't want our family, friends and neighbors lost to hell when they
could so easily be saved. And when we share the good news with them through our
words and actions, we are putting to work the treasure Christ entrusted to our care.
14 ""But his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, 'We don't want this
man to be our king.'
Even though Jesus sacrificed himself to pay for the sins of all, the world still rejects him.
Why? Some don’t want to repent of their sins. Others don’t want to believe that they
need a Savior. The wicked world hates its Savior; and, since the Savior is not seen on
this earth, the world often directs its hatred towards us: his servants. Because of this, we
face the pressure to stop sharing the Gospel with others – afraid of how people might
mock or reject us.
Yet, Christ encourages us to remain faithful stewards of His Gospel. Why? First and
foremost because he commands it. And, as we will see next, the LORD promises to
graciously reward our faithful stewardship.
Part Two: The King rewards faithful stewardship
He was made king, however, and returned home. Then he sent for the servants to whom
he had given the money, in order to find out what they had gained with it.
Jesus is coming back at the end of time as the King of Kings and Lord of Lords to deliver
and reward his faithful followers – just as he promised in Scripture. He will call each
believer to give an account of what we did with His Gospel. The first two servants
represent Christians, who faithfully put God’s Word to work by sharing it with others.
The results even astonished them.
16 “The first one came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned ten more.’
It is important to interpret what “the earned minas” represent in the parable, in order to
properly understand it. They are not the number of people who come to faith through our
witness. No, rather they represent our faithfulness in studying and sharing the Gospel –
regardless of whether or not people believe. God doesn’t command us to convert people.
Only the Holy Spirit can do that. The LORD simply wants us to be faithful in sharing his
Gospel.
Notice that the servant doesn’t claim to have done anything to earn the extra minas. No,
he gives all glory to the king’s mina. In a similar way, we too (if we remain faithful in
studying and sharing the Gospel) will stand before God on the last day in awe over all the
people God’s Word touched through our witness of his grace! With Luther we will
confess, “We did nothing LORD, your Word did everything!”
17 ”‘Well done, my good servant!’ his master replied. ‘Because you have been trustworthy
in a very small matter, take charge of ten cities.’
Jesus will show his joy over believers on the last Day by graciously rewarding them for
their faithful stewardship of His Gospel. We in no way deserve such a reward because
the Word did all the work. Nevertheless, Jesus promises to give faithful Christians
blessings and honor that far exceed our wildest imaginations. Why? Because that’s the
kind of God He is – merciful, loving and kind.
18 “The second [servant] came and said, ‘Sir, your mina has earned five more.’ 19 “His
master answered, ‘You take charge of five cities.’
Even though the second servant’s return was less (signifying that he wasn’t quite as
faithful as the first) notice that the King still rejoices over what his faithful witness
accomplished and rewards him accordingly. And even though his reward is less than
what the first servant received, it is still far greater than he could have ever imagined!
The point is this: Jesus is coming soon to graciously reward his followers who faithfully
study his Gospel and confess it to the world. This amazing grace is sufficient enough to
motivate faithful stewardship. However, since Jesus also knows that we all have a sinful
nature that tries to keep us from using His Word, he gives us the following example of
what a person’s unfaithfulness will reap.
Part Three: King condemns unfaithful stewardship
“Then another servant came and said, ‘Sir, here is your mina; I have kept it laid away in
a piece of cloth. I was afraid of you, because you are a hard man. You take out what you
did not put in and reap what you did not sow.’
This servant represents people who are Christians in name only: people who claim to be
believers when it suits their purpose, but don’t actually study, believe or share the
Gospel. Even though they may claim otherwise, they don’t really care what happens to
the lost. They, in fact, don’t even care about Jesus. All they really care about is
themselves, and their actions prove it.
“His master replied, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked servant! You knew
did you, that I am a hard man, taking out what I did not put in, and reaping what I did
not sow? Why then didn’t you put my money on deposit, so that when I came back, I
could have collected it with interest?’
The servant's excuse for hiding his mina was nothing but an insult. Regardless of how
hard a boss is, any decent employee would at least do the minimum his employer asked
him to do. This wicked servant didn’t even do that, thereby revealing His absolute hatred
towards the King.
But let’s go back to the wicked servant’s original claim: was the King a hard, evil man?
Didn’t he just graciously reward his servants with wealth and honor far beyond anything
they could have ever earned or deserved? You see, the devil, world and our sinful nature
are constantly trying to get us to think that God is evil and unjust. We may hear people
say things like, “If your God is all powerful and good, why does He allow evil in the
world?” or, “Your God says homosexuality is a sin? I don’t want a God who doesn’t
accept people the way they are!” In saying such things, people are either trying to justify
their sins or accuse God of being the author of human evil. They become like the 3
rd
servant in this parable: blaming God for the judgment their own sins brought upon
themselves.
Then he said to those standing by, ‘Take his mina away from him and give it to the one
who has ten minas.’ ”‘Sir,’ they said, ‘he already has ten!’ “He replied, ‘I tell you that
to everyone who has, more will be given, but as for the one who has nothing, even what
he has will be taken away.
The unfaithful servant is judged: his mina is taken away and given to the man with ten.
This act not only shows God’s justice, but also His grace. He was so pleased with the
faithfulness of the first servant that He graciously kept on giving him more, thereby
showing that those who faithfully use God’s Word will receive more and more blessings!
At the same time, what a horrible judgement for the wicked servant! He lost the only
thing that could save his soul from hell. He lost the Gospel.
But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them—bring them here
and kill them in front of me.’”
Jesus is certainly a loving Savior, who died for the sins of the whole world. He truly
takes no pleasure in the death of anyone. He wants all people to be saved by coming to a
knowledge of the truth. At the same time, Jesus is also just. If a person refuses salvation
by refusing to believe in Jesus, he will be condemned. Christ will judge such people –
not because he takes pleasure in it, but because in their unbelief they refuse the
forgiveness, life and salvation Jesus won for them by means of his cross. In doing so,
such people choose to remain enemies of Christ – even though God offered them peace.
As enemies of heaven, therefore, they will be condemned.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: as Christians, you bear the name of Christ. You have been
washed clean from all sin in Holy Baptism. Through faith in the Gospel you have been
clothed with Christ’s righteousness. You belong to the LORD, because he mercifully
saved you.
And he has also entrusted you with a great treasure. Don’t be like the last servant in our
text – hiding the Gospel from both ourselves and the world. No, be faithful steward of
the King's Mina by faithfully studying and sharing the Gospel. Why? Because the
LORD both commands it and promises to graciously reward our faithful use of his Word.
Even though our witness of His Gospel might not seem like it’s accomplishing much, the
LORD promises that it is never in vain. His Word will accomplish what he desires and
achieve the purpose for which he sent it. All this will be revealed when He comes again
at the end of time. Therefore we pray: “Come soon, Lord Jesus.” Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",11/6/2016,
"499 years ago, on October 31, 1517, a professor/monk named Martin Luther nailed 95 theses to
the Castle Church Door in Wittenberg, Germany. The theses were debate points he wanted to
discuss with fellow clergy regarding the sale of indulgences. Luther rightly noted that the
practice of selling indulgences was tantamount to selling forgiveness. It was unscriptural and
wrong. A person can neither buy nor earn his way into heaven. The only way a person can
obtain eternal life is if God justifies him – something the LORD does for all who look to him for
forgiveness in repentance and faith.
I can think of no better story that illustrates this truth than the parable Jesus told about the
Pharisee and the tax collector, which we will consider under the theme: Go home justified . . .
1) not because of your works, 2)but by faith.
Part One: Go home justified, not because of your works.
Our sermon text takes place while Jesus was on his final journey to Jerusalem, where he would
suffer and die for the sins of the world. Sadly, not everyone who followed him confessed their
need for his forgiveness. Like the rich synagogue ruler who once told Jesus that he had kept all
of God’s commandments, some of Jesus’ hearers thought that they too were good enough to
earn eternal life. They never stole, committed adultery or murdered anyone. They were good
people. Wouldn’t God let them into heaven because of this?
Sadly, most people today have the same attitude that the Jews had back then. I can’t count how
many times people have told me: “Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran – none of those labels make a
difference. All that matters is that you live a good life - following the golden rule of treating
others as you yourself would want to be treated. Just be good and you will get to heaven.”
Be good? As opposed to what? A devil? An angel? A 2016 presidential candidate? Saying,
“be good and you’ll get to heaven,” is tantamount to trusting in your own righteousness to save
you, and Jesus has something to say about that. We read:
9
To some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else,
Jesus told this parable: 10 ""Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other
a tax collector.
In order to understand the contrast Jesus is making in this parable, we need to understand
something about Jewish culture. The Pharisees were highly respected by the people of Jesus’
day. They lived according to the letter of God’s law – even going above and beyond what the
Bible required of them. I guess a good modern day example would be monks and nuns. Do you
ever hear people saying bad things about them? Rarely. And why is that? Because they seem
to have turned their backs on worldly pursuits in order to dedicate their lives to God. They pray
six times a day and seem careful to fulfill every law of their orders. Many have taken a vow of
poverty and some provide social relief. There are few people the world considers holier than
monks and nuns. The same was true regarding the Pharisees of Jesus’ day.
On the other hand, there were few things worse than a tax-collector. The Jews considered them
extortionists and traitors. Maybe a modern day parallel would be what we would call “a thug” –
someone who harasses and steals from the helpless. The Jews hated tax-collectors so much that
a number of rabbis taught that their sins could never be forgiven. They were doomed to hell.
Even though the temple was open all day for private prayer, there is good reason to believe that
the Pharisee and tax-collector came during either the morning or evening sacrifice – when a
Lamb was offered up for the sins of all people. This sacrifice foreshadowed the atonement the
Messiah would bring through his sacrifice for the sins of the world.
11 The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself: 'God, I thank you that I am not like other
men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers--or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week and
give a tenth of all I get.'
Notice that the Pharisee was so confident of his righteousness that he was not afraid to stand as
close to the sanctuary as possible with his arms stretched out in prayer. Now, in and of itself,
there was nothing wrong with the posture the Pharisee took. The Jews regularly prayed with
their arms stretched out ready to receive mercy from God. This Pharisee, however, didn’t have
his arms stretched out to receive mercy, his posture was more: “look at me – who I am and what
I have done.” He mentions God once in feigned gratitude, and then goes on talking about
himself. The law encouraged fasting once a year? He fasted twice a week. The law
commanded giving a tenth of certain items? He gave a tenth of everything he had. Compared
to all the crooks and criminals in the world, he was a saint!
But notice who he didn’t compare himself to: the LORD. And how could he? I mean even this
Pharisee would acknowledge that the LORD was far more righteous than he! And yet, if we are
going to make comparisons this is exactly the comparison God wants us to make. He doesn’t
say to us: don’t be as greedy as the habitual robbers and lust less than those living in adultery.
No, Jesus says: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”i
 If you are going to 
make a comparison, how do you compare with God? If we do this, we will be forced to confess
that we all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
ii
But back to the Pharisee in our text. We might be tempted to think: “What a blind, pretentious
buffoon: considering himself more worthy of God’s love than others.” And yet aren’t we all
tempted to do the very thing? Let me give you an example: more than once I have heard a
Christian say to me, “Pastor, I just can’t believe that God would be willing to forgive the really
evil people of this world – you know, like terrorists, rapists and pedophiles. Regardless of how
repentant they are, there has to be a limit to what the LORD is willing to forgive, right?” Now
let me ask you: how is this any different than what the Pharisee said: “God, I thank you that I
am not like other men--robbers, evildoers, adulterers”?
Yes, it is all too easy to fall into the trap of the Pharisee: thinking that our own goodness or
works merit God’s favor and forgiveness. It’s all too easy to compare ourselves to others
instead of God’s law. But here’s the thing: God takes no pleasure in our bragging, boasting or
comparing. He sees what’s in our heart. He knows how deeply flawed we are better than we
know it ourselves. As I mentioned before: God demands nothing less than perfection. We are
not perfect. Our flawed goodness, therefore, doesn’t earn us anything but hell. The LORD
wants us to realize this so that, like the tax collector, we can come before him in all humility –
turning to him alone for the free gift of forgiveness, life and salvation that he offers us through
the Gospel.
Part Two: Go home justified by faith.
Our text continues:
13 ""But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his
breast and said, 'God, have mercy on me, a sinner.'
The tax-collector knew his sins all too well and they terrified him. He knew that, in and of
himself, he had no right to come into God’s holy presence. The constant beating of his breast
was his way of saying: I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.
iii There
was nothing he could offer God, nothing he could do to change his past. He was a sinner.
And yet look: this tax-collector came in hope. He came believing the Old Testament promise
that God will forgive every wicked person who turns to him in repentance and faith. He came
believing that God will send a Savior, who will sacrifice himself for his sins. This is why he
prayed: “God, have mercy on me, a sinner.”
Now, I have to say something about his prayer that you won’t catch in any of our English
translations. Unlike other prayers for “mercy” found in the Bible, this tax-collector uses a
different word. A better translation would be: “God make atonement foriv me a sinner.” In
other words the tax collector is not just asking for general “mercy.” He is asking for
forgiveness. And what makes him bold to ask for this forgiveness? His faith in God’s Old
Testament promise to send a Savior for sin!
Yes, God’s Law and Gospel had worked repentance and faith in the heart of this tax collector – a
faith that not only led him to see the sheer horror of his sins, but also to hold God to his promise
to forgive all who turn to him in repentance and faith. And this is exactly what the tax collector
did: he repented of his sin. He didn’t compare himself to others. Actually, if you were to read
this text in its original language, you would see how his prayer reflects the trustworthy saying St.
Paul wrote to his disciple Timothy: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I
am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners,
Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on
him and receive eternal life.v
Which of those two men do you think when home “justified” – that is, declared free and forgiven
of all sin and at peace with God? Jesus tells us:
""I tell you that this man [the tax collector], rather than the other, went home justified before God.
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.""
Do you understand why the tax-collector went home forgiven and not the Pharisee? It’s because
the tax collector had faith in God’s promised salvation, and the LORD kept his promise: Jesus,
the Lamb of God, offered himself up as the once and for all sacrifice for sin. He suffered the
death and damnation we deserved. He paid for our sins in full. It is finished – just like God said
it would be.
King David wrote: The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O
God, you will not despise.vi Therefore, brothers and sisters in Christ: don’t come before God
bragging about your works, or comparing yourself with others. Don’t come before God thinking
that you deserve him to hear you. Come before him with a humble and penitent heart –
confessing your sins with sorrow. Come trusting in his mercy to forgive and help you live a new
life to His glory. This is what repentance is all about – the repentance Luther encouraged in his
very first of 95 theses that he posted on the Castle Church in Wittenberg 499 years ago: When
our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, “Repent”, he willed the entire life of believers to be one
of repentance.
Yes, like the tax-collector in our sermon text, be always turning from sin and to Jesus. We will
never be perfect on this earth, but we are forgiven for Christ’s sake. Trust what God says about
his grace and live in it. Then, like Zacchaeus, St. Paul, Luther and many other great sinner/saints
who have gone before us, we will find both the motivation and power to live our lives in
obedience to God’s will – not perfectly, but perfectly forgiven.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: go home from Church today justified - not because of who you are
or what you have done, but for Christ’s sake. You are right to trust in his mercy. Let this trust
renew your zeal to live as his dearly loved child on this earth. Amen.
",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",10/30/2016,
"Have you ever felt a longing in your heart to find meaning in your life, but couldn’t figure out
how to fulfill it? I think a lot of people feel this way and try to satisfy this longing with the
pursuit of wealth, leisure, and a variety of earthly things. But can such pursuits actually calm our
troubled hearts? Like a drug, they often numb the pain we feel by temporarily filling us with
pleasure. But they can never really solve the problem by giving us the peace and fulfillment for
which we long.
St. Augustine, an ancient Church Father, once attributed the longing we have in our hearts to our
separation from God. He famously prayed: “Thou hast formed us for Thyself, and our hearts are
restless till they find rest in Thee.”
God made our hearts restless to get people to reach out for him in repentance so that he might
save us from the eternal damnation that threatens our souls. Let us observe how the LORD did
this for a man named Zacchaeus so that we might also recognize the LORD’s work in and for us,
under the theme: The Seeking Savior . . 1) stirs in our hearts a desire to see him; 2) finds us and
calls us to receive him; 3) uses His salvation to change our lives.
Part One: He stirs in our hearts a desire to see him
1 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through.
Our sermon text takes place during the last leg of Jesus’ final journey to Jerusalem. Since
Jerusalem was an entire day’s trek away, many Passover pilgrims spent the night in Jericho
before continuing on their journey. Jesus, however, did not merely travel through that city to
find a safe place to spend the night. No, he came to Jericho to find a specific man, whose heart
was restlessly searching for salvation.
2
A man was there by the name of Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy.
In order to understand Zacchaeus you should know something about the way Rome collected its
taxes. They didn’t have an Internal Revenue Service like we have in America. No, they sold the
right of collecting taxes to wealthy groups or individuals. As long as Rome got its money and
riots weren’t caused by exorbitant rates, privatized tax collectors were allowed to charge
whatever they wanted to cover their costs and make a profit. More often than not, tax collectors
abused the system by extorting money from their fellow countrymen in order to get rich.
Because of this, the Jews hated tax collectors – considering them traitors.
Zacchaeus was a “chief” tax collector – meaning that he was either very well known in Jericho
or a manager over other tax collectors. He lived his life in pursuit of earthly wealth and ease –
thinking that these things would fill the longing he felt in his heart for purpose. He worked hard
at his job – eager to do what it took to get ahead. Honestly, Zacchaeus could have been any
career driven American today whose whole focus is making a profit.
I know, some might be thinking that there is a difference between being a business man in
today’s world and a tax collector in Jesus’ day: business men don’t extort money from their
neighbors. True, but even everyday business people are tempted to charge a little more just
because they can. Isn’t that the whole point of supply and demand capitalism? And even if
Zacchaeus were an honest tax collector, he still made his career, wealth and success his gods –
hoping that they would give his life meaning. Aren’t we also tempted to worship those same
idols?
But Zacchaeus didn’t have peace. A restlessness stirred inside of him that his wealth could not
calm. Earlier in life, he didn’t care about his relationship with the LORD, but now – as he got
older – he began to wonder: “What will happen to me when I die?” Could he, who lived his life
in selfish extravagance, ever hope for salvation? The rabbis taught that, being a tax collector,
Zacchaeus pretty much damned himself to hell with no hope of forgiveness. Truth be told, they
didn’t want him to be saved – that’s how much they hated tax collectors!
But Zacchaeus heard rumors of another rabbi who performed mighty miracles. That rabbi was
not ashamed to eat with sinners. In fact, one of his disciples was a former tax-collector! People
were starting to wonder whether or not this rabbi was the Messiah. If he was, Zacchaeus
wondered, would he welcome a man like him?
And so a desire stirred in Zacchaeus’ heart to see Jesus. Little did he know that this desire did
not come from himself, but the Holy Spirit awakened it through the news he heard about Jesus.
The LORD wanted Zacchaeus to know His Son and believe in him for salvation. And so, when
Zacchaeus heard the news that this famous rabbi was in town . . .
3 He wanted to see who Jesus was, but being a short man he could not, because of the crowd. 4
So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.
In Jewish culture, no respectable man would run or climb a tree in public. Such actions were
considered childish. But Zacchaeus’ desire to see Jesus ran so deep that he didn’t care what
people thought of him. He dropped his work, wealth and even his dignity just to see Jesus.
Oh, that we would be like Zacchaeus – willing to drop everything to see Jesus! Sadly, how often
don’t we do the opposite: allowing other things to steal us away from him? Every Sunday and
Monday Jesus is here to meet us, but how often don’t we let other ""more pressing” needs get in
the way of coming to worship? How often don’t we hide our faith, afraid of what people might
think if they knew what we believed?
Yes, we can learn a lot from this little tax collector; nothing is more important than seeing Jesus
because not only does the LORD stir in our hearts a desire to see him, he finds all who are
looking for him - calling them to receiving his salvation.
Part Two: He finds us and calls us to receive him.
5 When Jesus reached the spot, he looked up and said to him, ""Zacchaeus, come down
immediately. I must stay at your house today.""
Zacchaeus may have hoped to see Jesus, but little did he know that Jesus was also searching for
him. This is why Jesus stopped and addressed Zacchaeus by name.
Yes, Jesus knew more about Zacchaeus than Zacchaeus knew about himself. He knew how
Zacchaeus loved money so much that he sacrificed his faith in order to become a tax collector.
He knew how Zacchaeus hurt his own countrymen by extorting money from them. Jesus knew it
all. And yet, Jesus says that it’s necessary for him to stay at his house!
Didn’t Jesus know that, by staying at his house, the Pharisees would consider him unclean?
Didn’t Jesus know, that the people would think poorly of him because he associated himself with
sinners? And yet Jesus – the Messiah – says that he must stay at his house!
6
So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly.
Yes, Zacchaeus was happy. Jesus’ command convinced him that he was the promised Messiah –
the LORD himself, who came to take away his sins. Zacchaeus was lost, but now the amazing
grace of Jesus found him and worked repentance and faith in his heart in order to receive
salvation.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: the Savior who found Zacchaeus and made his dwelling with him,
is the same Savior who found us. He knows each of us individually and invites us to receive
him. And how do we receive him? Through repentance and faith! Yes, our dear Savior wants 
to dwell with us – making his home in our hearts. He knows all about our sins and past
unfaithfulness – and yet he is willing to forgive all. He is our Savior who loves us. In him our
hearts find rest.
So are we going to continue joyfully answering Jesus’ call and gladly welcome him into our
hearts? Or do we ignore his call to receive him – thinking that we have more important things to
do? Sadly, we lifelong Christians are often tempted to forget what Christ’s love means for us.
Just as a couple that has been married a long time might forget how empty their life was before
they met; so we are often tempted to neglect our relationship with Christ - forgetting how empty
our life was before he brought us to faith. This is why it’s important for us to take time to
meditate on God’s law as well as his Gospel. It’s only when we see our need for him through the
law that we appreciate how he sought us out in love and called us to faith. His salvation truly
changes us.
Part Three: His salvation changes our lives.
7
All the people saw this and began to mutter, ""He has gone to be the guest of a 'sinner.' ""
Was Zacchaeus a sinner? Absolutely. But what the people failed to understand is that Jesus
didn’t come to save the righteous. He came to save sinners – calling them to repentance and
faith. This is why he was not ashamed to be Zacchaeus’ guest. This is also why he is not
ashamed to dwell with you and me.
8
But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, ""Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my
possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times
the amount.""
By making these promises, Zacchaeus is not trying to make himself look good before the
Messiah. No, rather he is confessing his new-found faith in Jesus: a faith that changed him.
Notice that Zacchaeus calls Jesus “Lord” - revealing his conviction that Jesus is the Messiah –
the LORD incarnate. Jesus saved Zacchaeus from his sin, and, in response to that love,
Zacchaeus wants to start a new life. He wants to use his wealth to honor God and help people –
for this is why God gave him his wealth in the first place.
9
Jesus said to him, ""Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of
Abraham. 10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.""
Jesus is not saying that Zacchaeus is saved because of his pledge to pay back those he cheated
and give half his wealth to the poor. No, Jesus is saying that Zacchaeus is saved because he
repented and believes in him – proof of which is his changed heart. Zacchaeus is a son of
Abraham – not merely by birth, like the Pharisees and Sadducees. Zacchaeus is also a son of
Abraham by faith – something the unbelieving Jews could not claim. Zacchaeus trusted in Jesus,
and that faith changed his life. It changed his eternal future – giving him the precious gifts of
forgiveness and eternal life – all of which he received by faith.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, our seeking Savior offers us the very same gifts of forgiveness, life
and salvation that he offered Zacchaeus. And when we receive these gifts through repentance
and faith we also undergo a change. The Holy Spirit creates a new person in our heart – one
that does not want to live selfishly, but that wants to honor God in everything. As Christians, we
begin to care for our neighbors as Christ cared for us. We want to use our wealth to help support
the Gospel and bring relief to those in need.
Now, this doesn’t mean that we won’t have a selfish nature to contend with. No, we will have to
struggle against our sinful flesh until the day we die. But with Christ we can overcome our
sinful nature. The good news of his salvation changes us. It moves us to want to do good –
putting his glory and the welfare of others ahead of our own. Jesus, our seeking Savior, finds us
and fills the longing we have in our restless heart with his forgiving presence. Live in the joy of
this fact that, just as Jesus sought Zacchaeus, so he has sought you – calling you by name to be
his own and so that you can live with him forever in heaven. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",10/9/2016,
"Have you ever been tempted to give up praying – discouraged because you think your prayers
aren’t accomplishing anything? I think we all have. I remember a woman at a former parish,
whose husband was diagnosed with an aggressive form of colon cancer. She prayed and prayed
that the LORD would spare her husband - only to see him die months after he was diagnosed.
She asked me if there was something wrong with her prayers because they didn’t seem to affect
any change what-so-ever.
If God (who consistently knows what’s best) always does what he wants, what point is there in
praying? Can our prayers actually influence God?
Jesus addresses these questions in our sermon text for today, as he encourages us not only to
pray, but to pray both persistently and confidently.
Part One: Pray Persistently
Our sermon text follows a discourse Jesus had with his disciples about the suddenness of his
coming on the last day. Because of all the dangers that threaten to destroy Christ’s Church
before his reappearing, He then told them a parable on the need for them to pray always and not
become discouraged.
Like a weary soldier in the heat of battle, surrounded by enemies, we might be tempted to think
that no one hears our call for help. Even Jesus acknowledges that we can become discouraged
because of all the bad things we experience on this earth. But He says: “Don’t give up praying –
even though you are tempted to think that your prayers aren’t accomplishing anything. Keep on
praying - trusting that God hears you and will help.” By means of a parable Jesus now explains
why we can have this hope.
“There was a judge in a certain town who didn’t fear God or respect man.
There are few things worse than a corrupt, godless judge. Who can get justice from such a man?
Can we ever imagine him doing the right thing? There was no trial by jury or court of appeals in
ancient Israel. There were no judicial review panels, who could investigate this man. This judge
had all the power and seemed to only make decisions that would benefit him.
And a widow in that town kept coming to him, saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’
The widow Jesus describes in this parable is the exact opposite of the judge. She has no power
or influence at all, but lives at the mercy of others. Being poor, she could not bribe the judge.
There was no reason that he should ever rule in her favor except one: she knew that the LORD
instituted Israel’s judicial system to help people like her. Because of this fact, she expected the
judge to do his job and grant her justice. And so, even though he kept turning her away, this
persistent widow kept coming back to the judge: reminding him of his duty to her. She never
gave up expecting what was right – what the LORD promised to provide for her through Israel’s
judicial system.
“For a while he was unwilling, but later he said to himself, ‘Even though I don’t fear God or
respect man, yet because this widow keeps pestering me, I will give her justice, so she doesn’t
wear me out by her persistent coming.’ ” Then the Lord said, “Listen to what the unjust judge
says.""
Yes, listen to what the unjust judge says. Consider his words carefully and apply them to our
relationship with God. The widow’s constant pestering wore the judge out. Her unanswered
demands were like a constant public beating– revealing his merciless heart to all. The widow
forced his hand. He had to grant her justice.
Now, if a corrupt judge such as the one in the parable will grant the request of a widow because
of her persistence in asking, how much more, then, will the perfectly righteous and just judge of
heaven and earth do the same? Or, as Jesus puts it: Will not God grant justice to His elect who
cry out to Him day and night? Will He delay to help them?
Think about the argument Jesus is making: We are like the widow: in need of help. We are
powerless to save ourselves. In fact, we are worse off than the widow in the sense that she had
every right to demand justice. We, on the other hand, have no right to demand anything from
God. Because of our sins, the only thing we deserve from the LORD is his eternal wrath and
punishment.
But then consider our God. Unlike the selfish, unjust judge of the parable, the Lord has such a
supreme interest in us that he left his heavenly home to take on human flesh and blood in order
to save us. He - our righteous God - suffered and died for us: his unrighteous, rebellious
creation. He did this in order to grant us a justice we don’t deserve. He paid for our sins in full
on the cross so that all who believe in him might be justified from every wrong they have ever
committed or will ever commit!
Jesus' point, then, is this: if a widow's persistent asking can sway a judge who doesn’t love
anyone, how much more will our persistent prayers influence our God who loves us so much,
that he suffered death in order to save us? We have no reason to question whether or not our
prayers are heard by God: they most definitely are! He loves it when we pray and promises to
take them into consideration. Regardless of whether or not our prayers are answered exactly as
we want them to be, we can have confidence that he hears us and will work in all things for the
good of those who love him – just as Jesus promises in our sermon text: I tell you that He will
swiftly grant them justice.
Yes, even before a word forms on our lips, our God has heard the desire of our heart. He is
ready to answer and save. But he will do this in his good and gracious time since he knows not
only what’s best for us, but also when the best time is to give it.
In other words, the LORD may not answer our prayers right away. St. Peter once wrote: Dear
friends, don't let this one thing escape you: With the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a
thousand years like one day. The Lord does not delay His promise, as some understand delay,
but is patient with you, not wanting any to perish but all to come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:8-9
HCSB)
The LORD’s patience might mean that God will allow us to suffer for a time. For example, St.
John once had a vision of the suffering church crying out to God for justice: They called out in a
loud voice, ""How long, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, until you judge the inhabitants of the
earth and avenge our blood?"" Then each of them was given a white robe, and they were told to
wait a little longer. . . (Revelation 6:10-11 NIV84) Notice that God does not deny his suffering
saints justice, but asks for their patience. A time will come, a time already determined and
known by God, when he will judge Satan and this wicked world for all the suffering they have
caused believers. On that day, the LORD will swiftly bring his deliverance.
But until that day, the LORD wants us to pray both patiently and persistently at all times and for
all people. He wants us to pray that our enemies repent of their sins and come to faith. He wants
us to pray that those who suffer will be healed. He wants us to pray for the success of his Gospel
and that he comes again soon. Yes, God wants us pray persistently and never get discouraged.
He also wants us to pray in all faith – confident that He will keep his promises!
Part Two: Pray Confidently
You see, whenever we are tempted to give up praying – thinking that our prayers aren’t
accomplishing anything - our discouragement usually stems from the fact that we are focusing
more on ourselves and our problems then on our Almighty God and his gracious promises. This
is why Jesus adds a thought provoking question at the end of his discourse on persistent prayer:
Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He find that faith on earth?” 
Now, first of all we have to be clear: Jesus is NOT saying that there will be no Christians when
he returns. The Bible clearly states that the Church will remain on this earth until he comes
again on the Last day. There will always be believers in the world.
However, the Bible does say that a lot of people will abandon their faith in God as the last day
approaches. Elsewhere Jesus himself predicted that many will turn away from the faith and will
betray and hate each other, and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.
Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold. . . For false Christs and
false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect--if that
were possible. (Matthew 24:10-12, 24 NIV84)
So, when Jesus asks if he will find faith on the earth when He comes again, he is warning us that
we will be severely tempted to doubt God’s promises and fall from faith. This is all the more
reason why we need to always pray and never lose heart or give up. Prayer is an exercise of our
faith because it holds God to his promises. And God loves it when we do this. He loves it when
we both confidently and persistently expect him to give us what he promises us in the Gospel.
He loves it when we pray for forgiveness, life and salvation – not only for us, but for others as
well. Our prayers matter so much to God that the Bible tells us we should always expect to
receive everything we ask for in prayer without any hint of doubt.
But what if, after praying persistently and confidently, God doesn’t give us what we ask for?
What should we do then? We should remember Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane. He prayed
more persistently and confidently than any other person on this earth ever has or ever will. Do
you remember how God answered his prayer? He didn’t give Jesus exactly what he asked for:
deliverance from his suffering. He, instead, gave him what both he and we needed: strength to
endure his suffering so as to win our salvation and glorify his name.
Whenever God doesn’t give us exactly what we ask for, it’s only because He knows more than
we do. He will give us what we truly need. He asks us to trust him in this, and we Christians do.
This is why we end every prayer same way Christ did in Gethsemane: may your will, and not
mine, be done O LORD. And even if we don’t understand now, we can trust that God’s good
and gracious will is truly what’s best for us – just as it was for Christ.
So, brothers and sisters in Christ: don’t get discouraged by all the evil you see around. Continue
to pray persistently and confidently. Christ promises that He hears us; and that – in his good and
gracious time – he will grant us the deliverance we so desperately need. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",10/2/2016,
"How many of you remember the TV program “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous”? Robin
Leach hosted the show and, as the title indicates, he would show off the homes of rich and
famous people while talking about their lifestyle. Beautiful houses, cars, and friends, going
wherever you want and doing whatever you wish . . . “Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous” gave
viewers a dream to chase. Even if we could never obtain the extravagant luxuries of the people
on the show, we were nevertheless encouraged to pursue our dreams and live as comfortably as
possible.
But is luxurious, carefree living really the highlife? The world thinks so, but Jesus doesn’t. Let
us listen to him explain the truth about fame, fortune, and living the highlife. 1) He dispels
the earthly myth and 2) presents the eternal reality.
Part One: The earthly myth.
Shortly before our text takes place, Jesus talked to his disciples about the shrewd use of earthly
wealth and warned them not to love it more than God. Some money loving Pharisees overheard
what Jesus said and ridiculed him. This gave rise to Jesus’ instruction about fame and fortune.
He said:
19 There was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day.
Jesus doesn’t name the rich man in the story, but we can assume that he was well known to his
contemporaries. The fact that he could afford purple clothing (which was very expensive in
Jesus’ day) and live in luxury tells us that he was very rich and used his wealth for extravagant
living. I imagine his lifestyle being like that of billionaire Donald Trump before he ran for
president: a real tycoon who threw the classy parties that all the “who’s who” went to. I could
imagine that everyone wanted to be like him: carefree and enjoying all kinds of extravagance.
20 At his gate was laid a beggar named Lazarus, covered with sores 21 and longing to eat what
fell from the rich man’s table. Even the dogs came and licked his sores.
What a pitiful sight Lazarus must have been. You can almost picture the crowds coming to one
of the rich man’s parties and quickly passing this no-name pity of a person by in disgust. No one
wanted to be like him. They didn’t even want to be near him! This man’s only friends were the
dogs who licked his sores. In the world’s eyes, Lazarus was the picture of what it meant to be at
rock bottom.
22 “The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham’s side. The rich
man also died and was buried.
There is no mention of Lazarus having a funeral. His body was probably picked up and disposed
of because no one knew who he was. Nobody cared.
But God did care. God knew Lazarus by name. His name means: “The Lord helps.” Lazarus
trusted in the LORD for salvation. He clung to his God throughout his tough life. Even though
Lazarus had no earthly riches, fame or pedigree, he had faith in the LORD – because of which,
he was known by God and welcomed to Abraham’s side in heaven.
When the rich man died we can be sure that his funeral was as lavish as his lifestyle. Celebrities
probably spoke about how he lived well. But, even though a lot of people may have been
shocked and saddened at his death, the Lord didn’t care. Did you notice that throughout the
story, the rich man’s name is never mentioned? This fulfills what the Lord says in Psalm 16: that
he will not even take the names of the wicked upon his lips. The rich man’s death was of no
importance to heaven. He was just another poor soul going to hell.
Which of these two men had a fulfilling life? The world claims that the rich man did. Wasn’t
his luxurious lifestyle the very definition of living well? Wouldn’t we also like what he had: a
fancy house with lots of beautiful and influential friends? Wouldn’t it be nice if money were no
object and we could live carefree?
The problem is that focusing on this kind of life separates us from the LORD. Even though this
man was wildly rich, he was spiritually poor. He failed to follow the Lord in faith. He was
unknown to him, and therefore lost all he had in death.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: don’t fall victim to the earthly myth of fame, fortune, and living
the highlife. Even though the world encourages you to do all you can to pursue a life of earthly
ease, the LORD warns us that this pursuit separates us from him. He says: 15 Do not love the
world or anything in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. (1
John 2:15 NIV84). And again: 36 What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit
his soul? (Mark 8:36 NIV84) And isn’t this exactly what happened to the rich man in our
account: didn’t he gain the world at the cost of his soul?
Yes, not the rich man, but poor Lazarus was the one who had it all. He had it all because he had
Christ, who forgave his sins and gave him his righteousness as a free gift. Even though every
aspect of his life seemed to indicate that the LORD had forsaken him, Lazarus continued to trust
Him for salvation. And, his faith did not disappoint! God welcomed him to heaven – giving him
the honor of being comforted by the famous father of faith himself: Abraham.
Part Two: The eternal reality.
Our text continues describing the plight of the rich man. We read:
23 In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by
his side. 24 So he called to him, ‘Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the
tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.’
Because of his unbelief, which was demonstrated by his life of self-indulgent luxury, the rich
man was in hell. The one from whom Lazarus once begged, now became a beggar himself. As
he sees Lazarus sitting next to Abraham, he asks the father of faith for a small favor: just a drop
of water from the tip of Lazarus’ finger. I wonder how often Lazarus begged for a similar crumb
of mercy from the rich man during his life on earth – only to be refused.
25 “But Abraham replied, ‘Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things,
while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony. 26 And
besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go
from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.’
Abraham reminds the rich man that, in life, he loved luxuries more than the LORD – proof of
which was allowing his fellow Israelite suffer right outside his house! God left ample warnings
for the rich man through the Scriptures of what his fate would be if he pursued wealth over the
LORD. The rich man chose to ignore those warnings in order to do the opposite of what God
commanded. His punishment was just and final – just like God said it would be.
Lazarus, on the other hand, persevered in his faith - in spite of receiving only bad things in life.
God gave Lazarus the reward he promised to all the faithful throughout the Scriptures: eternal
life with him in heaven. This judgement was also final. Nothing could take Lazarus away from
the blessings he now enjoyed with the LORD.
I want to pause here to point out something else about the rich man: did you notice that his
attitude didn’t change in hell? There’s no word of him repenting of his sins. He still thinks that,
just because he is a Jew by birth, father Abraham should listen to him and grant him relief. He
still doesn’t get it: salvation has nothing to do with who we are and what we do. Salvation
comes only through faith in Christ Jesus. This is why it is of the utmost importance for us to
grow in our faith through genuine repentance and meditation on God’s Word.
Mark the warning well. Many people have the same kind of hope in their heritage that the rich
man did. They say to themselves, “As long as I am baptized, belong to a church and pay my
dues all is well. I don’t need to regularly go to worship, Bible Class or study God’s Word at
home. Why? Because I am a Lutheran – just like my parents and grandparents were before me.
As long as I pray and stop in to worship every once in a while, I’m fine.” How easy it is to trust
in “belonging to a Church” or “our Lutheran heritage” for salvation, instead of in Christ and the
Gospel! All those who have such a shallow faith in Christianity instead of Christ will find
themselves next to the rich man in hell, who relied on his being a child of Abraham to save him.
27 “He answered, ‘Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father’s house, 28 for I have five
brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.’ 29
“Abraham replied, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.’ 30 “ ‘No, father
Abraham,’ he said, ‘but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.’ 31 “He said to
him, ‘If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone
rises from the dead.’ ”
Again, the rich man, though sorry for what he is suffering, doesn’t actually show any sign of
repentance. Instead of confessing that his sinful lifestyle got him where he was and endangered
his family, he asks that Lazarus be sent back from the dead to warn his family. By doing this he
is, in effect, blaming God for being in hell. “If only God had sent someone to warn me, then I
wouldn’t be here. I would have changed my ways. Someone has to warn my family, so that they
don’t stumble into hell like me.”
Abraham rightly pointed out: They have Moses and the Prophets. . . 'If they do not listen to
Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.'"" God
has left his testimony on this earth – warning people about sin and directing them to his Son for
salvation. He has given his Word, which is sufficient for all warning and consoling because God
has promised to send his Holy Spirit to work in the hearts of all those who hear it. God’s Word
warns us against all selfishness and sin. It calls us to repent and points us to Jesus as the only
source of forgiveness. It creates and strengthens faith in our hearts - encouraging us with God’s
promise of eternal life and salvation through faith in His Son.
But what about what the rich man said: wouldn’t a flashy miracle be more effective in getting
people to repent and believe in Jesus for salvation than just preaching God’s Word?
Well, Jesus raised another man named Lazarus from the dead. How did the leaders of the Jews
receive that message? The Bible says that they wanted to kill that Lazarus to cover up the
evidence of Jesus miracle! Jesus rose from the dead: how did the Jews receive him? Most didn’t
believe. Miracles do not create faith: only the Gospel in Word and Sacrament can accomplish
that.
The only way to heaven is through repentance and faith in the Gospel. It’s only when we realize
our sinfulness and look to Jesus for forgiveness that our attitudes and lifestyles change. Because
of Christ’s forgiving love for us we want to love each other. If we experience bad things in life,
like Lazarus, we are not afraid. Why not? Because we are convinced that God will keep his
promise to deliver to heaven. And if we experience good things in life, we rejoice and share with
others the blessings God has given us.
Living a life of faith and good works to God – all in response to his saving love toward us: this is
what God wants our lives to be all about. So, brothers and sisters in Christ, learn the truth about
earthly fame, fortune and living the high life. The ability to live luxuriously on this earth may
seem like a dream we ought to pursue, but God warns that pursing such a life separates from
him. Let us then be like Lazarus and pursue the LORD in everything because, even if we lose
everything in this life, we will have lost nothing. The Lord will remain our help and deliver us
home to himself in heaven – just like he did for Lazarus. Amen ",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",9/25/2016,
"What thoughts went through your mind when you heard today’s sermon text? Did you think
about all the Wall Street scandals over the past two decades; and say to yourself: “Corporate
America certainly needs to take this warning seriously!”
But what about you? Don’t you need to take this warning seriously too? At first glance we
might think: “But, I don’t take advantage of the poor. I don’t cheat on my taxes. I conduct my
business with integrity. This text is meant for the world, not a Christian like me, right?”
But, here’s the thing: when the LORD had Amos originally pen this text, it wasn’t for the pagan
world. He gave this prophecy to God’s people, who had strayed from his commands and
stumbled down the never ending rabbit hole of greed. Now, even though you may not be like the
Israelites described in our text, you still have a selfish, sinful nature inside of you: one that
entices you to be greedy. And, as we will learn in our sermon for today: God Hates Greed. 1)
It corrupts our worship. 2) It hurts those the LORD wants us to love. 3) Only in Christ can we
overcome.
Part One: It corrupts our worship.
Our sermon text was originally written to the people living in the northern kingdom of Israel
around 750 BC. Under King Jeroboam II’s leadership, the population felt very secure and their
economy prospered. Yes, humanly speaking, it seemed like an excellent time to live in the
northern kingdom. But there was a hidden rot under this façade of prosperity: idolatry, wasteful
extravagance, immorality, oppression of the poor, and economic corruption ran rampant. Even
though the Israelites were physically prosperous, they were spiritually poor. Their religious
fervor was all just a show: going through the motions of worship without true faith. 
The LORD was concerned with what he saw: the people’s greed had turned their hearts away
from him. Evidence of this fact was how they treated their poorer country men. God had given
them the commands: “Love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and
with all your strength,”i
and “love your neighbor as yourself.”ii He specifically commanded them:
be openhanded toward your brothers and toward the poor and needy in your land.
iii
But the Israelites, over time, began to neglect these commands. Why? If we take an honest look
inside our own hearts, I think we can figure it out: they coveted the extravagant luxuries other
nations were enjoying around them. Businessmen wanted the same profits their non-Israelite
counterparts had. But how could they get those things by keeping God’s rules? Not only did
they lose money helping those in need, but they weren’t allowed to work during the Sabbath.
That really cut into their profits! So, making the excuse that they had to watch out for number
one lest they become poor themselves, many stopped helping the needy as they ought. Greedy to
achieve their goals, the weekly Sabbath day became a burden instead of a blessing. They went
through all the motions of worship – thinking: “Come on: Let’s get this day over with. I will
have done my duty to God, and then I can get on with getting the things I want to enjoy.”
Brothers and sisters in Christ, have you ever approached worship with thoughts like: “Come on,
let’s get this over with. I have stuff to do”? Maybe it was on Thanksgiving, and all you could
think about was the early bird sales you were missing.” Maybe it was before an early Packer
game or some other event you wanted to get too: your desire for something else made your
worship like that of Adam and Eve’s son Cain who killed his brother Abel because he was
jealous that God didn’t accept his worship. Do you know why God didn’t accept Cain’s
worship? It’s because it wasn’t done out of faith; and neither is our worship, when our minds
are on things like money, sports, leisure, work or anything else instead of the LORD.
“But,’ someone might say, ‘at least I come to church. That’s better than not coming at all,
right?” No, actually it’s not. They are both equally sinful in God’s sight. Both reveal a selfish
heart. God hates it when people go through the motions of worship without truly listening,
thinking and believing in him.
You may have never tried to cheat the poor, but who of us can claim that we have never
worshipped God with a divided heart? Our sinful nature is selfish: it likes thinking about the
things that can give it pleasure rather than on the LORD. God hates greed. Why? First and
foremost because it corrupts our worship of him. The person, object or thing we are greedy for
steals God’s place in our hearts. It becomes an idol. Is it therefore any wonder that God’s Word
encourages believers: Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual
immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry?
iv
Yes, God hates greed. It corrupts our worship of him. It also hurts those God wants us to love.
Part Two: It hurts those the LORD wants us to love.
The Israelites, to whom Amos originally gave this message, had drifted far from the LORD.
Commanded to help the poor, they took advantage of them instead. They used uneven scales, 
bad weights and dirty grain – all with the hope of making a little more money. And if someone
borrowed money to buy sandals but couldn’t afford paying them back? Well, they were so keen
on getting their money that they would rather see their fellow Israelite brother sold into slavery
than forgive that debt.
Their greed hurt the very people God commanded the Israelites to love: the poor, weak, sick,
injured and defenseless. God was so disgusted by their greed that he said: The LORD has sworn
by the Pride of Jacob (that is, himself): ""I will never forget anything they have done.”
Wow, can you imagine God saying such a judgement over you? Thankfully we never have to
worry about that, right? Why not? Because none of us would ever be that greedy – selling our
countrymen into slavery just to get more money.
While it may be true that we have never gone to that extreme, that doesn’t mean that our greed
hasn’t hurt the people God commanded us to love. Consider Luther’s explanation of the
seventh Commandment: “You shall not steal. What does this mean? We should fear and love
God so that we may not take our neighbor’s money or property, nor get them with bad products
or deals, but help him to improve and protect his property and business.”
Have you ever been at a garage sale and saw an item that was worth far more than the person
was asking? What did you do: tell him its true value? Or did you think to yourself, “He should
have known better,” and buy it from him without breathing a word of its true value? If you did
the latter, is that keeping God’s commandment the way Luther explained it?
Or what if someone less fortunate than us is selling what they have at a very inexpensive price in
order to pay their bills. Do you take advantage of their misfortune, or pay them what is fair?
How about if a store makes an honest mistake – advertising an item for $2 instead of $20? Do
you insist that they sell you the product for the advertised price – even though you know that the
$2 would not cover their cost?
In our business dealings, are we always looking out for the person we are negotiating with, and
not just our own interests?
Or how about when we see a person in need: do we help them? Or do we say to ourselves: “He’s
probably just a schnook - taking advantage of the system” and turn a blind eye to him?
You see, God doesn’t just call us to love our family and friends, he calls us to love all people –
including our enemies.v
 The LORD would rather us be taken advantage of then take advantage
of others.vi
 And why is that? Because, when we take advantage of others, we dishonor God’s
name. They will think: “What kind of God is the LORD, if his followers selfishly cheat, steal
and only look out for themselves?” No, these kinds of actions dishonor God – hurting the very
people our Savior calls us to love. And can any of us claim to be sinless in this regard?
So where does that leave us? Are we doomed to face the same judgment Israel faced – when the
LORD swore: ""I will never forget anything they have done”? We certainly deserve the same 
punishment. So where does that leave us? I don’t know about you, but it leaves me at the foot of
the cross – begging Christ for forgiveness. Why? Because, only in Christ, can we overcome the
greed that lurks within our nature.
Part Three: Only in Christ can we overcome.
The LORD certainly knew about the sinful corruption of our hearts. He could see that there was
no way we could either pay for our sins or overcome the selfishness of our nature. We would be
helplessly lost in sin, unless he did something about it. And, God be praised, He did do
something about it: He sent his one and only Son into the world to live the perfect life we all
failed to live in order to win the righteousness we need to have to gain eternal life. Jesus showed
perfect love to God. How? By going to the Synagogue every Sabbath to both learn and teach
His Father’s Word. He showed perfect love to his fellow man by feeding the hungry, healing the
sick and, most importantly, teaching the way of salvation. And when the time came for Him to
suffer for our sins on the cross, Jesus didn’t shrink away from doing that. Out of great love
towards both God and us, He willingly offered himself up for our sins.
Jesus glorified God’s saving name by showing unselfish love to God and the world. Because of
this fact all our sins have been paid for in full. The LORD no longer remembers the sins of those
who cling to him in faith. Why? Because He remembered them when Jesus was on the cross
and punished him for them all. We are free. More than that, the LORD has also sent the Holy
Spirit to create a new person in our hearts – one that wants to love others as God himself loved
us. Yes, our new man wants to love people – not because it fears God’s wrath or wants to earn
heaven. It already knows that it has heaven as a free gift. No, our new man wants to love others
simply because it rejoices in the love it has received from God. This new man loves like Jesus
loves – as St. Paul once said: I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ
lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave
himself for me.
Only in Christ can we overcome the greed that lurks with in our sinful flesh. Why is that?
Because our Savior God, who absolutely hates greed, took our sins upon himself to suffer and
die for them all. More than that, he has given us a new man – one that is completely selfless and
loving. By means of the Gospel, the Holy Spirit directs this new man and helps him overcome
the selfishness of our sinful nature. He reminds us of God’s love for us – a love that made us his
children in Holy Baptism. How can we not worship God with genuine love, all in response to
the great love he showed us? How can we not love our fellow man – doing all we can to help
him? No, we will never be perfect in this life, but with the forgiving help our God offers us we
can overcome the greed he hates – all to the glory of his name. We can only do this in Christ, for
he already overcame our greed for us. Amen.

"Do you remember what it was like living in America before September 11, 2001? There were no
long security lines at the airport. Any child, who asked nicely, could visit the cockpit of an
airplane and talk to the pilot midflight. Very few people worried about terrorists. Why?
“Because,” we thought, “our country is too far away from those kinds of people. Two huge
oceans isolate us from most of the world. On top of this, we are the most technologically
advanced country on this earth. Wouldn’t our government know if a foreign terrorist was
planning something and be able to deal with them before they had the opportunity to do anything
bad?”
But then something happened that we never saw coming: planes struck the Pentagon, World
Trade Center and another one, headed for the capitol, crashed into a field before it could reach its
destination. This was the first major, foreign attack on US soil since Pearl Harbor. Our nation
was shaken to its core. The safety we once felt was gone. Sure, our government tried to reassure
us that it will do everything in its power to protect us, but can it really prevent a horrific event
like 9/11 from ever happening again? Will we ever be able to feel totally safe?
In our Gospel lessoni
for today, Jesus warned that bad things will continually happen on this
earth until He comes again on the Last Day. Why? Because the earth is filled with wicked men,
like the one described in Psalm 10. Does this mean that we will never feel safe on this earth? Is
there no refuge from all the evil that people plan against others?
The Bible tells us that there is a place where we can be totally safe. Where is that? It’s with
Jesus. With the last verses of Psalm 20 as our guide, let us meditate on this truth, under the
theme: We trust in the Name of the Lord our God. 1) He alone has the power to save. 2) He
will keep His promises.
Part One: He alone has the power to save.
Our sermon text is part of a psalm King David wrote for his people to sing as they prepared for
battle. Right before our text, David asks the Lord to protect the king and give him victory. He 
expresses confidence that the LORD would grant his request by saying: Now I know that the
LORD saves his anointed; he answers him from his holy heaven with the saving power of his
right hand.
What gave King David the confidence that the LORD would protect him in battle? Was it that
he led the mightiest, most technologically advanced military of the time? Absolutely not! Truth
be told, Israel’s army was one of the weakest in the region! They didn’t even have chariots or
horses!
But what they did have gave David the greatest comfort and security - even as he faced enemies
far more powerful than what he could muster. The LORD almighty was with them! He alone
has the power to save.
The LORD wants us, his believers, to have the same confidence David had in God’s ability to
keep us safe. But how can we be sure that He has the power to do that? Well, just look at
creation! Our universe seems almost unending with countless stars in hundreds of billions of
galaxies. Yes, creation itself cries out that our LORD has power!
But just the fact that God has power to create, doesn’t necessarily reassure us that he has power
to save. To know this we need to look in the Bible, which is chock-full of examples of the
LORD faithfully saving his people. For them He divided waters, toppled walls and destroyed
powerful armies that opposed them. One of my favorite Old Testaments examples of how God
watches over his people is found in 2 Kings when the Aramean army surrounded Elisha and his
servant – intent on capturing them. ""Oh, my lord, what shall we do?"" the servant asked. ""Don't
be afraid,"" the prophet answered. ""Those who are with us are more than those who are with
them."" And Elisha prayed, ""O LORD, open his eyes so he may see."" Then the LORD opened the
servant's eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around
Elishaii
. Just think: the LORD doesn’t just send guardian angels; he sends guardian angel
armies!
However, the greatest demonstration of God’s power to save is found in how He sent his Son to
win our eternal salvation. Our greatest enemy is not some terrorist group holed up in the
mountains of Afghanistan. It’s the devil, world and our own sinful flesh that are constantly
trying to drive a wedge between us and God by enticing us into sin, doubt and despair. These
terrorists are not just trying to kill our bodies; they are trying to drag our souls into hell. Worse
yet, we are totally powerless against these spiritual enemies. . . But Jesus isn’t. He took it upon
himself to save us from these spiritual terrorists by becoming man in order to take away the only
weapon they had to separate us from God’s love: our sin. He lived the perfect life we failed to
live – thereby earning the righteousness we need to stand before God. He took all our sins upon
himself on the cross – suffering the punishment we deserve. His resurrection from the grave
proves that our sins have been paid for in full. And to make sure we would receive the benefits
of this forgiveness, He sent the Holy Spirit to lead us to repent of all sin and create saving faith
in our hearts by means of his Word. We are free. Rage as he might, the devil cannot touch
believers – all because of Christ. Now if Jesus is able to save us from our most dangerous
enemies, then we can be sure that he has the power to protect us from anything!
After the events of 9/11, there was a lot of talk in the media about improving our intelligence,
military, and border security to keep us safe. But none of these things could ever make us totally
secure. As our sermon text indicates, if we put our trust in “horses and chariots” (our military
and technological superiority) we will be “brought to our knees and fall.” Such is the fate of all
those who trust in such things. Rather we should put our trust in the one who created heaven and
earth, controls all things, and has already defeated our greatest enemies. He alone has the power
to save us. He alone is able to turn even the evil we experience into something that will serve
our eternal welfare!
We trust in the name of the Lord, for he alone has the power to save! But this is not the only
reason why we trust in him. If it were, then our hope would be as wishy-washy as hoping that
billionaire Bill Gates would give us a million dollars just because he is superrich. No, we also
trust in the name of the Lord because he not only has the power to save; he also promised to do
so!
Part Two: He will keep His promises.
We certainly do not deserve anything from God. You know what His law demands: 'Be holy
because I, the LORD your God, am holy.
iii
 You know that whoever keeps the whole law and yet
stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
iv
 You know that the wages of sin is
eternal deathv
in hell - where the worm will not die, nor will the fire be quenched. Our sins put
us at enmity with God. We deserve nothing but his wrath and punishment. And isn’t that why
God allowed a disaster like 9/11 to happen to our country: to punish us for our sins?
If God were to punish America for its sins, this nation would no longer be on the map. No, Jesus
tells us that whenever he allows a disaster (regardless of whether it’s natural or manmade), his
purpose is to remind us of our mortality and need for salvation. He wants us to repent of our sins
and turn to him for forgiveness.
vi
 He wants us to let go of the world and cling to him alone. He
is with all who hold on to him in faith - promising them many blessings.
And what, exactly, are those blessings? First of all he promises to listen to us in our time of
need, saying “Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor me.""vii

He promises to hear all our prayers, saying: “Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer,
believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”
viii
 The Lord promises to protect us from
all our enemies. He says: 'You are my servant'; I have chosen you and have not rejected you.
So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you
and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. . . . Though you search for your
enemies, you will not find them. Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all.
ix

The LORD promises to work in all things – even the evil we experience – for our good.x
 Even
death is no longer something we need to fear – as the LORD says through Isaiah: The righteous
perish, and no one ponders it in his heart; devout men are taken away, and no one understands
that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil. Those who walk uprightly enter into
peace; they find rest as they lie in death.xi
 Finally, the LORD promises believers eternal life, as
Jesus once said: My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them
eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand.xii
God has promised believers all these blessings and has demonstrated throughout history that he
has the power to do what he says. He doesn’t protect us because we have earned or deserved it.
He does it merely out of love. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.xiii St. Paul writes in Romans:
He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all-- how will he not also, along with
him, graciously give us all things?xiv
When our country was attacked on September 11, 2001, the things our nation trusted in to protect
us failed. Our government promised that they would do everything in their power to prevent
something like that from happening again – that we don’t have to be afraid. I know, however,
that no matter what our government does to try to protect us, they will never be able to do it
perfectly. We are always in danger. And yet, I am not afraid. Why not? Because I know that
my LORD is watching over me and my loved ones. He alone has the power to save and he will
keep his promises. Even if the world falls apart and we are surrounded by suffering and death,
Christians can be confident that none of these things will be able to separate us from the love
God has for us in Christ Jesus our LORD. No matter what happens, we will always remain
totally safe in him. Let us share this message with our countrymen so that, through repentance
and faith, they too may have the same peace, hope and totally security we enjoy in Christ.
Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",9/11/2016,
"I can just imagine how fun being a volunteer firefighter would be. You get to face a little
danger, play with big equipment, and spend time shooting the breeze with guys at the station –
all the while feeling good that you are saving people.
Yes, being a volunteer firefighter would be great: but then why doesn’t everyone do it? I think
the biggest reason is that, even though it is voluntary, it still involves commitment. You can’t
choose whether or not you want to respond to a call. When the beeper goes off, you have to go.
This may mean giving up time with your kids because some electrical short caused a house fire.
It might mean giving up a Packer game if someone got into a car accident. Volunteer firefighters
can’t be “half–committed” - only responding to the calls they want to respond to. No, you are
either all in or all out: there is no middle ground.
In a certain way being a Christian is like being a volunteer firefighter. Just as a fire chief
demands total commitment from the men he leads, so also our Savior demands total commitment
from us. Let’s consider this truth under the theme: Being a Christian means: 1) Loving Christ
alone. 2) Trusting Christ alone.
Part One: Loving Christ Alone
Our sermon text takes place while Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. Many people joined him.
Why? Probably because they were fascinated by his miracles and intrigued with his teachings.
Many toyed with the idea of becoming one of his disciples. They envision how he would
miraculously provide for their every need and heal every disease. They imagined all the earthly 
benefits they would have as Jesus’ disciples without really considering what being a Christian in
a sin cursed world actually means.
Now don't get me wrong: Jesus certainly wants disciples. He truly desires the salvation of all!i
But he also knows that superficial, half-hearted Christianity will not benefit anyone. Why not?
Because the salvation he came to win can only be received through faith.
This is why he stopped, turned to the crowd and said: “If anyone comes to me and does not hate
his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own
life, he cannot be my disciple.
What? Did we hear Jesus correctly: unless we hate our own family, we cannot be his disciples?
How are we to understand this statement? Well, we certainly should not understand it in the
sense that Jesus wants us to wish evil or harm on them. Remember: this is the same Jesus who
also commanded husbands to love their wivesii and children to honor their parentsiii
. He, in fact,
commands us to love all people - including our enemies!iv
No, when Jesus says that we must “hate” those we hold most dear – including ourselves – we
must understand Jesus’ words in the context of the first commandment, the meaning of which
Luther explains as: ""We should fear love and trust in God above all things.”
I think one of the best ways to understand what Jesus means is to think about the account of
Abraham and Isaac on Mount Moriah.v
 Do you remember that story? The LORD told Abraham
to sacrifice his only son Isaac on that mountain. This was a test to see whether or not Abraham
truly feared, loved and trusted in God above all things. One could only imagine the shock and
turmoil Abraham felt at this command. But what did Abraham do? He got Isaac and set out for
Moriah early the next morning. He loved the LORD above all and was even willing to sacrifice
his own son, if God commanded him. Thankfully, the LORD stopped him from doing that. He
provided a ram to be used in place of Isaac. He also allowed this story to be recorded in the
Bible for at least two reasons: 1) to give us an example of what it means to love God above all
things, and 2) to provide and illustration of how God would sacrificed his own Son for our
salvation.
When Jesus says that a disciple must hate everyone he holds dear – including his own life – what
he means is this: Being a Christian means more than just loving God more than our family
friends and neighbors. Being a Christian means that we love Christ alone. Why? Because he is
our God and Savior who called us into a special relationship with him! And just as a husband
loves his wife to such a degree that he would hate any woman who would attempt to break the
marriage bond he has with her, so also Jesus wants us to be faithful to him – loving him alone
and hating person or thing that wants to separate us from him.
But this kind of love is difficult. Unbelieving family members and friends often try to tear us
away from Christ. When we lovingly warn them of their unbelief they sometimes lash out at us,
saying that we should love and accept them as they are. Is that true? Does true love mean that
we have to respect their life-style choices? No, it doesn’t! Knowing what Christ says in the
Bible, we can’t condone their wicked behavior. Christ’s love compels us witness the truth. This 
will lead us to reject their sin and lovingly call them to repentance. And if they threaten to shut
us out of their lives unless we accept their unbelief? Well, then the Christian will prayerfully
bear this rejection for Christ’s sake – keeping with what Jesus says next: 27 Whoever does not
bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.
To understand Jesus’ words we have to think about what a cross meant to first century Jews
living under Roman rule. A cross was a most horrible instrument of torture. It was the emblem
of total shame and excruciating pain. No one would willingly take up a cross – no one except
Jesus, that is.
Jesus was so totally committed to saving us from our sins that he chose to take up the cross in
order to suffer the punishment we deserve. He suffered and died for the sins of the whole world
so that whoever believes in him may not perish, but have eternal life.vi

But even though Jesus took up his cross willingly, we must understand that the reason he was
crucified was because the world hated him. They did not want to believe that their actions were
evil. They didn’t want to believe that they needed a Savior from sin. If the world treated Christ
this way, should we Christians expect anything different?
Being a Christian means that people we love might pressure us to make a choice between Christ
or them. This is a hard because no one wants to lose the love of another. And yet, as a Christian,
there can only be one answer: Being a Christian means loving Christ alone. No other
relationship matters because no other relationship saves.
Part Two: Trusting Christ alone.
To emphasize our need to take our faith in him seriously, Jesus offers two illustrations. He says:
28 For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, whether
he has enough to complete it? 29 Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to
finish, all who see it begin to mock him, 30 saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to
finish.’ Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not sit down first and
deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty
thousand? 32 And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for
terms of peace.
No ancient King would build a grandiose monument without making sure he had the resources to
complete it. Why not? Because, instead of erecting a monument to his greatness, an unfinished
tower would be testimony to his folly.
The same is true regarding war: a wise king would never attack an enemy unless he is sure that
he had the resources to win. Doing otherwise would be disastrous!
The point of these parables is this: just as building a tower and waging a war are not things you
rush into without giving serious thought, so also following Christ requires serious reflection.
We Christians are at war. Our enemies are the devil, world and our own sinful nature. Do we, in
and of ourselves have the power to battle these enemies?
A Christian’s life is meant to glorify God? Do we, in and of ourselves, have the resources to
make our lives such a monument to Christ?
Only a rash fool would say yes. The truth, however, is that there is not a single person on this
earth who has what it takes to be a disciple of Christ. If left to our own power, we would fail
miserably. And this is exactly the conclusion Jesus wants us come, as he says next: So therefore,
any one of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.
Being a Christian means that we don’t trust in ourselves; we trust in Christ alone. Without his
forgiving love, aid and instruction, we could never fashion our lives into a monument dedicated
to his glory. Without his power, protection and strength we could never overcome our spiritual
enemies. Like the apostle Paul in our first readingvii, Jesus wants us to see the truth about
ourselves and our accomplishments: it’s all rubbish: Being a Christian means that we realize the
futility of everything we have and are and lay them at the cross saying: “LORD, I am nothing
and can offer nothing. Everything I am and have is of no value. You are the only thing that
matters, for only you can save me. Only you can reconcile me to the God the Father and give me
the hope of eternal life. Only you give my life true meaning and purpose. Forgive my sin and
cover me with your righteousness so that I can be the disciple you want me to be – all to the
glory of your name.”
And do you know what? Jesus hears such a heartfelt prayer and answers it by forgiving all our
sins and covering us with his righteousness. Through faith, His perfect love and obedience to
God becomes our perfect love and obedience to God. Through faith we have all the resources
we need to defeat our spiritual enemies and live our lives to his glory. He gives us all these
things in His Word.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: just as no one wants a half-hearted volunteer firefighter, who only
answers the call when it suits him; so also Christ doesn’t want half-hearted disciples who are still
torn between serving him and their own selfish sinful natures. This is why he calls us to
carefully consider what being a Christian will mean for our lives on this earth. He doesn’t do
this to chase us away from him. He does it so that, when difficult days comes, we might cling to
Christ all the more – loving and trusting in him alone for forgiveness, life and salvation. This is
what it being a Christian is all about. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",9/4/2016,
"Terrorist attacks, Zika virus, tornadoes, flooding, crime, civil unrest . . . with all the things
happening in the world, it’s hard not to worry about our loved ones and ourselves. Who will
keep us safe from all these perils? And then there are all the worldly influences the devil uses to
try to separate us from our salvation, such as: materialism, work-righteousness, our society’s
redefinition of morality and intolerance towards the Gospel. Where do we find refuge from these
soul destroying threats?
We find our refuge in the LORD himself: our almighty God who not only created each and every
one of us, but also graciously redeemed us from our sins by the blood of his Son. He promises
to walk with us on our journey through life and deliver us safely to our everlasting home in
heaven. With Psalm 121 as our guide let us find comfort in our Guardian God, under the theme:
The LORD watches over you. 1) Consider his power. 2) Trust in his protection.
Part One: Consider his power.
Psalm 121 is one of 15 “songs of ascents” found in the book of Psalms. Many theologians think
that these songs were sung by the pilgrims who were on their way “up” to Jerusalem to celebrate
a major festival like the Passover.
For many pilgrims the journey was long and hard. They couldn’t take a car or bus. Most didn’t
even own horses. The people walked – sometimes hundreds of miles – so that they could see
God’s temple and celebrate the way the LORD delivered their ancestors from Egypt. But these
celebrations were not only a remembrance of former times, but offered hope for times yet to
come. Just as the LORD faithfully kept his promises in the past, so he would keep them in the
future by sending a Savior who would take away the sins of the world. Being in God’s house
with thousands of other faithful pilgrims – celebrating the LORD’s presence and love . . . this
gave the people great joy. It made their difficult journey worth the effort.
The Israelites pilgrimage to Jerusalem wonderfully illustrates our life on this evil earth. God has
freed us from our slavery just as he freed ancient Israel: through Jesus’ life, death and
resurrection he save us from our bondage to sin, death and the power of the devil. He chose us to
be his own people – adopting us in Holy Baptism. We belong to him every bit as much as the
pilgrims who went to Jerusalem. And we too are on a journey to God’s house – his heavenly
temple in his heavenly Jerusalem. Like the Israelites, we are happy to make our journey because
we want to be with God.
But the ancient journey to Jerusalem was both difficult and dangerous. The pilgrims could not
sleep in the nearest Super 8 or Motel 6. Many camped out in open fields – surrounded by wild
animals and exposed to the elements. There was no highway patrol monitoring the roads.
Bandits could attack at any moment. Who would watch over the pilgrims? Who would protect
them on their journey?
The pilgrims knew! They sang: I lift up my eyes to the hills-- where does my help come from? 2
My help comes from the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth. Why does the Psalmist look to
the hills for help? Because the hills he looks to are the hills that surround Jerusalem, the Holy
City of God! On one of those hills stood the temple of the LORD, who created the heavens and
earth. He is the one who holds back the flood and reins the tempest in. He is the one who moves
mountains and causes the earth to shake. He is the one who sends the storm and commands the
wind and waves. He is the one who calms the oceans, makes the spring sun melt the winter
snow, brings forth the spring flowers, and watches over every sparrow.
i
 On top of this, He has
thousands upon thousands of mighty angels at his command.
Our help for our earthly pilgrimage comes from the all-powerful LORD. He will protect us from
the devil, who prowls around like a lion, looking for someone to devour.
ii
 He protects us from
false teachers, those spiritual thieves and bandits who try to steal us away from Christ.
iii
 He
stands as the Good Shepherd. As we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we fear no
evil, for he is with us.
iv
What comfort this brought the pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem, and what comfort it brings us!
Yes, the dangers that face us are very real and very scary. And the worst part is that we often
don’t perceive the spiritual perils that threaten us because we don’t keep watch. Praise the
LORD that he is ever vigilant. He uses godly friends and relatives to warn us with His soulsaving
Word. He encourages us through the Church’s preaching of the Gospel and our own
private meditation of the Bible. Our God is gracious and all-powerful. We can trust in his
protection.
Part Two: Trust in His Protection
Our Psalm continues: He will not let your foot slip. Now at first glance, someone might think
that a slipping foot is such a minor thing that we might wonder why God would protect us from
that. But think about this: my mom’s foot once slipped on a step. That little slip resulted in
bones so broken that she had to have a plate and seven screws put in her lower leg. As you can
see: even a minor slip can lead to major hurt. 
So also little spiritual slips can lead to major spiritual hurt. For example, a little careless word
can lead to broken friendship and shattered trust. A little slip of having a one night stand can
lead to unwed pregnancy and lots of worry. The Bible even goes so far as to say any minor slip
of God’s law in thought, word or deed makes us worthy of eternal hell.v
But God keeps our feet from slipping. How? By giving us his Word that warns us of all the
temptations that threaten our soul. And if we fall into sin? Then God leads us to repent –
reassuring us that Jesus has paid for every one of our sins through his death on the cross. We are
forgiven through faith in him. Not only that, but God also awakens a desire in us to avoid future
sin. He sends the Holy Spirit to instruct us through His Word to keep us from slipping again.
And if we do slip again? Jesus is there with his forgiving love to pick us up, bandage our hurt
and take away our sin so that we can continue on our journey.vi
The Psalmist continues: He who watches over you will not slumber; 4
indeed, he who watches
over Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
5
The LORD watches over you-- the LORD is your
shade at your right hand; 6
the sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night. What a
wonderful assurance this is! Just think: God has not merely assigned an angel to watch over you,
the almighty LORD himself watches over you. And he is not just “keeping an eye” on you
either. No, he is keeping watch: fully alert to all the danger that surrounds you. He never takes a
break from this work. Day and night he keeps his vigil - protecting us from all harm and
bringing relief to our sin-scorched souls.
The Psalmist writes: The LORD will keep you from all harm-- he will watch over your life; the
LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore. From what kind of
harm will God keep you? From every single kind there is: disease, crime, disaster, sin,
temptation . . . you name it! The LORD promises to protect your soul.
“But,” someone might ask, “don’t Christians suffer evil all the time? Don’t some fall victim to
crime and others to disease? Aren’t Christians hunted every day in other parts of this world and
killed for their faith? How can the Psalmist say that the LORD will keep us from “all harm”
when we all experience harm at some point in our lives?”
The Psalmist can say this because the “harm” God protects us from is not physical but spiritual.
God doesn’t just want us to have a good life on this earth; He wants us to live with him forever
in heaven. And to that end he is always working: using even the evil we experience in life to
serve that good purpose. I cannot tell you how or why God does it. Only he knows. But there is
one thing I can say for sure: just as a doctor might hurt his patient in an attempt to heal him, so
also the LORD only allows hurt in our lives to spiritually benefit us in some way.
Why do I believe this to be true? Because the Apostle Paul writes in the book of Romans: we
know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him.
vii
 Later on he adds: Who
shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or
nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: ""For your sake we face death all day long; we
are considered as sheep to be slaughtered."" No, in all these things we are more than conquerors
through him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor 
demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor
anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ
Jesus our Lord.viii
God will keep our souls from all harm in the sense that He will make sure that nothing separates
us from His love for us in Christ. God will protect us from crime, terror and disease. And if, in
his divine wisdom, he allows us to experience these earthly evils, then we can trust that he only
allowed them for our spiritual good: to strengthen us in our faith as we journey through life home
to His house in heaven.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: when faced with seemingly insurmountable worries and troubles,
take comfort in your Guardian God. The almighty LORD himself promises to stand beside you
through thick and thin - guarding you in all your ways. He uses his ultimate authority to keep us
safe throughout our earthly pilgrimage. He himself accompanies us on our journey – always
ready to warn, instruct and forgive. Yes, there is no need to be afraid: the LORD himself is
watching over you. Consider his power. Trust in His protection. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",8/28/2016,
"Have you ever felt like giving up? Maybe it was during a new diet you started. Things started
off well, but then you saw that double-layered chocolate fudge cake, oozing with a dark, creamy
frosting; and a friend says: “Do you want a piece?” How about that exercise program you
started, and even enjoyed, but the results are so slow in coming that you just want to give up?
How do you overcome the desire of giving up? Ask a winning athlete, musician, or any other
person who has succeed in what they put their mind to, and they will tell you that success comes
from constantly renewing your focus on the goal. A good coach always tells his players, “Stay
focused!”
As Christians we may also feel like giving up. Sometimes our sinful doubts and desires just
seem too great for us and we want to give in to them. It is during times like these that we need to
stay focused on our ultimate goal in life by reminding ourselves what that goal is. Let us do just
that with today’s sermon text, under the theme: Look forward to the LORD’S Salvation. 1)
Salvation that the Lord himself prepares for us. 2) Salvation that we only receive through faith.
Part One: Salvation that the Lord himself prepares for us.
Our sermon text begins: 6 On this mountain the LORD Almighty will prepare a feast of rich food
for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine— the best of meats and the finest of wines.
The LORD compares the wonders of eternal salvation with a kingly banquet. Why? Because he
knows that our finite human brains can’t comprehend the glories of his everlasting paradise any
more than an amoeba can understand advanced calculus. This is why God uses pictures to
represent His coming glory; and the picture he uses is that of a feast. Why a feast? Because good
food and drink combined with good company makes the heart merry! Who doesn’t enjoy being
at a well catered party with your best friends – laughing and enjoying yourself? The point is this: 
God wants us to be with him - enjoying his presence and living in perfect harmony with each
other forever.
And notice whom this banquet is for: not just Israel and Judah, but for all people from every
tribe, nation, language and culture. The LORD of heaven wants his paradise filled with believers
from every corner of the globe – united in faith and praise of Christ. This is exactly how St. John
describes heaven in his book of Revelation, where he writes: 9
After this I looked and there
before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and
language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. . . . And they cried out in a loud
voice: ""Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."" i
Isaiah tells us the LORD himself is preparing this everlasting feast. Why is he doing it himself?
Because our salvation is not like a “potluck” in which we can offer some of our works or merits
for the party. No, our human “goodness” offers nothing to God because, outside of Christ, even
our most righteous acts are tainted with sin; as the Scriptures say: “All of us have become like
one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags.”ii
Because of our sins, we not only can offer God nothing, we deserve nothing from God except his
eternal wrath and punishment in hell. God is 100 % righteous and holy. He cannot tolerate any
sin in his presence. We are anything but holy with our impure and selfish thoughts, words and
actions. It’s because of our sins that there is death in the world, as the Scriptures say: the wages
of sin is death.
iii
 That’s the bad news.
But here is the good news: God does not want us lost forever in hell. He loves us – even though
we don’t deserve it. This is why he took it upon himself to give us a special gift – as the
Scripture passage I quoted earlier continues: the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is
eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.iv
 Forgiveness life and salvation – this is the feast God
himself is preparing for us in Christ Jesus , which we will fully enjoy when He comes again on
the Last Day, as our sermon text continues:
7 On this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all
nations; 8
he will swallow up death forever. The Sovereign LORD will wipe away the tears from
all faces; he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth. The LORD has spoken.
You’ve probably seen it on TV shows: whenever someone dies, they are covered up. Why?
Because the living do not like looking at the dead. In a similar way our sins separated us from
God to such a degree that he does not like looking at us. As I mentioned before: God’s holiness
prevents him from even tolerating the slightest sin in his presence. Sin kills. It separated us
from God. Death is our disgrace because it proves we are sinful.
But God promises to remove the shroud that covers the nations. Why? Because that shroud
won’t be needed anymore! God promises to make us alive. He promises to take away mankind’s
shame and destroy the death that consumes us. How? The only way he could: by taking away
our sins.
And this is why He sent his one and only Son into the world. Even though Jesus was tempted in
every way as we are, he kept his Father’s law perfectly in our place. He took all our sins upon
himself and suffered the death we deserved because of them. And, do you know what the best
part is? He rose victoriously from the grave – thereby showing that all sin has been paid for in
full. He conquered death so that, whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
v
And this is why we can smile when a Christian dies and defiantly say: ""Where, O death, is your
victory? Where, O death, is your sting?” . . . thanks be to God! He gives us the victory through
our Lord Jesus Christ.”
vi
 We can say this with all confidence looking forward to Christ’s return
when He will raise the dead, wipe every tear from our eyes, and allow us to enjoy his perfect
paradise where there will be no more sin, sorrow, death or pain. There will only be joy and
peace forevermore.
And how can we be certain of this? Because: “the LORD has spoken.” This statement is like
God’s signature on a contract. Whatever God promises, that He must do. His name bears
witness to this fact – for if the LORD ever went back on his promises, he would cease to be who
He is.
How often do you get paid? Those who get paid once a month know about the struggle there is a
week or two before your paycheck when all the bills come due, and cash is running low. This
struggle makes you look forward to “payday” when there will be no more bills, and you can
celebrate with a nice dinner in the evening. Keeping focused on “payday” can help you go
forward in your work and not give up.
If our attitude is such for a measly paycheck, how much more shouldn’t we look forward to
Christ’s return? Look at what he is giving us! Joy, peace, life and a place at God’s table! Look
at what he is taking away from us: ignorance, sorrow, pain, and death! As we struggle through
these last days, look forward and rejoice in the salvation the LORD is preparing for us. He will
give us the strength to press on, because we know that our present sufferings are not worth
comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.vii
Part Two: Salvation that we only receive through faith.
Hearing about both the wonderful things God is going to do and the bad things he will take away
from us, really makes us want to be on God’s holy mountain, right? But how do we get there?
Well, let’s look at how the people in our text got there: In that day they will say, ""Surely this is
our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. With one voice they confessed that it was the
LORD who saved them. In other words, they didn’t do anything to get there, God did it all.
But they also said that they trusted in God. In other words, they received the salvation God
prepared for them by believing His promise. Without that faith, they would have never received
God’s gift because they wouldn’t have believe that it was true. But because they believed God,
they, with the Holy Spirit’s help, persevered in their goal of receiving what God promised. Like
Abraham of old, they followed God’s direction and guidance – not letting any worldly worries or 
troubles detract them from trusting the LORD. And their God came through, as they themselves
confess: Surely this is our God; we trusted in him, and he saved us. This is the LORD, we trusted
in him; let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.”
Imagine that your boss came to you this week and told you that he is going to give you a $2000
Christmas bonus because he values you as an employee. What would you do? Most likely you
would thank him now and tell your family the good news about the coming Christmas bonus.
Your boss's promise would give you joy in the present and encourage you to work all the harder
for him.
But what if an employee said to his boss, “Ya, right. I don’t believe you.” Would that worker
have the same joy you had? Would he look forward to Christmas as much as you? Would he
love his boss as much as you? Finally, would he attempt to cash his boss’s bonus check once it
came – if he didn’t believe it was real? No he wouldn’t. His unbelief would prevent him from
enjoying the gift.
In the same way if a person does not believe God’s promise of salvation, the promise will do him
no good. His life will not be joyous but laborious. He will not look to the end of his life with
hope, but despair. He will not receive salvation because He refuses to have it.
But the opposite is true for the person in whom the Holy Spirit has awakened faith. He will
believe God’s promise, and that belief will give him hope. His faith in God’s salvation will
sustain him through every difficult day of life – as he happily lives for his LORD. He will stay
focused on the salvation God has prepared for him, ever reminding himself of God’s promise,
and look forward to receiving it with joy. And, when Christ does return, the LORD will fulfill
his promise – giving him eternal salvation for Christ’s sake.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: our daily life is a struggle. Many times we feel like giving in to
the temptation to give up our faith. When the devil, the world, and our sinful natures press us
hard, let us focus on the promises God gave us and look forward to the LORD’S Salvation:
Salvation that the Lord himself is preparing for us, and salvation we that we only receive
through faith. Let the thought of this eternal salvation move you to press on - knowing that God
will most certainly fulfill what he promised because Jesus has already paid for your sin. Amen.
",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",8/21/2016,
"Do you ever wonder what it would be like to be a real life cowboy? I got to experience it once
when I was around 12. My Dad and I went on a father/son trip together to eastern Montana where
my Dad was going to install a new pastor at a country church. At the service, we ran into a rancher
my Dad knew from when he was a pastor in Great Falls. He invited us to have breakfast on the
ranch early the next morning, so we went.
When we got there he gave us the news: some cattle got through a broken fence and he needed to
round them up. He was wondering if we would like to be cowboys for a day and help. We happily
agreed, so he had his ranch hands saddle up the horses and we three set out to spend an entire day
on the range – rounding up cattle under the big, blue, Montana sky.
I’ll never forget that day because, as it turned out, we not only rounded up quite a few cattle, but
also some stray horses and a lost flock of sheep! Mr. Stensvad really loved his animals. He didn’t
want any of them lost. This is why he took the time to ride out on the range – finding the lost and
bringing every animal back to where it needed to be.
In our sermon text, the LORD describes himself as a shepherd; that’s a rancher who takes care of
sheep. We are his sheep. God uses this picture of shepherd and sheep to teach us how much he
loves us. Let us consider this love, under the theme: Jesus is our searching Shepherd. 1) He
looks for his scattered sheep. 2) He comforts, feeds and leads us home.
Part One: He looks for his scattered sheep.
Imagine, after a hot humid day, a nighttime thunderstorm rolling over the prairies. Rain, hail,
lightning and thunder: it would be terrifying enough for us who are in the comfort of our own
houses, but just think what it would be like for the animals stuck outside – especially if they lived
in ranching country like eastern Montana, where there are barely any trees and very few places for
cover. Storms like that can send animals into a frenzy. You can just imagine how scared they are
and how easily they could get hurt.
After a storm like that, a good rancher will go out to check on his animals. He loves them and
does not want any of them lost or hurt. He’ll enlist the help of his ranch hands and will not stop
until he has found every single animal.
The LORD also seeks us out like a rancher after a storm. He says in our sermon text: I myself will
search for my sheep and look after them. 12 As a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he
is with them, so will I look after my sheep. I will rescue them from all the places where they were
scattered on a day of clouds and darkness.
Like scared, little sheep all people have run away from God. What scares us? The threat of
punishment.
Children, you know how you feel when you do something wrong – like breaking something your
parents told you not to touch. You’re scared to tell them because you might get spanked or
grounded. You feel like hiding. If you can understand that feeling, then you can understand why
all people run away from God.
You see, God has given us his Holy Law – the Ten Commandments – and told us not to break
them. God said that the punishment for breaking any one of his commandments is eternal death
in hell. He’s very serious about this, because his commandments are meant to give us wonderful
blessings.
But guess what? Every person on this earth has broken his commandments. And because we have
done this, we are scared of God because of the punishment he threatened. This is why people run
away from God in the same frenzy as an animal running away from a storm!
But God does not want us lost in hell. He loves us. Even though we have broken his precious
commandments and have gotten ourselves into a lot of trouble, he still loves us so much that he
took it upon himself to save us. And how did he do that? By taking on human flesh and blood so
that he could be like us in order to suffer our punishment in our place. And that is exactly what
Jesus did on the cross: he suffered and died for our sins, and then he rose again so we can live with
him forever in heaven.
Because Jesus did this there is no reason to be afraid of him any longer. He wants us to know this
and return to him. This is why Jesus looks for us like a rancher looks for his animals after a storm.
He calls out to us through his Gospel – telling us that everything is ok, that we don’t have to be
afraid of him anymore. 
And just as scared animals don’t always come right away to a rancher, so also scared sinners don’t
always come to their Savior when he first calls them. A rancher will often call on his ranch hands
to help him round up his cattle. Our Savior calls on Christian parents, pastors, teachers and friends
to help him round up his lost lambs. They come to us with God’s Word. They warn us not to run
away because that will just get us into more trouble. And, just as a person might entice an animal
with the food it loves, so also God’s helpers entice us with the spiritual food our souls need: God’s
Gospel promises of forgiveness, peace, love and eternal life with him forever in heaven.
In this way God calls out believers from every nook and cranny in this world, gathering them
together to be his dearly, loved sheep; as he himself says: 13 I will bring them out from the nations
and gather them from the countries, and I will bring them into their own land. I will pasture them
on the mountains of Israel, in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land.
Part Two: He comforts, feeds and leads us home.
Now, when a rancher gathers his scared animals, he knows that some of them might be very
hungry, others might be very thirsty, and still others might be hurt. This is why a good rancher
won’t drive his animals hard, but tend to their needs – giving them food and water, and making
sure they are healthy after such a traumatic experience.
Jesus, our good Shepherd, treats us in a similar way. He says: 14 I will tend them in a good pasture,
and the mountain heights of Israel will be their grazing land. There they will lie down in good
grazing land, and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. 15 I myself will
tend my sheep and have them lie down, declares the Sovereign LORD. 16 I will search for the lost
and bring back the strays. I will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak. . .
Where is the rich pastureland to which Christ lead us for spiritual rest, renewal and peace? It is
his Word that we hear at Church or read in the Bible. God’s Word tells us of the countless ways
Jesus cares for us.
For example, if we are tempted to worry whether or not we will have enough to eat or drink, we
can remember that God created the heavens and the earth. All things belong to him. And just as
he feeds every animal, so he will feed us – for the Bible says that we are much more valuable to
him than they.
If we are worried about all the scary things happening in the world, we can remember God’s
promise to send his angels to protect us from all harm and danger. God himself promises to be
with us and work in all things – even the bad and scary things that happen – for our eternal good.
When we are sick, we can take comfort in the fact that God has the power to heal us. Not only
that, but if God allows our sickness to linger or allows us to die, he promises that even death will
be a blessing for us. Our believing souls will be with him as our bodies rest in the grave. Not only
that, but God also promises to raise us up from the dead, so that we can live with him forever in
paradise.
And what is the paradise God is preparing for us? The Bible tells us that it is a perfect place where
there is no sin, sorrow or death – only things that are lovely and good. Imagine a beautiful
mountain forest or flowery meadow with no mosquitos and ticks. Imagine every animal being at
peace with you so that you can play with them. Imagine no crime, terror or threat of war. Imagine
no illnesses and nothing that makes you sad. Imagine all that and, on top of it, Jesus will be there
– smiling upon you and always ready to give you a hug. He will spend time with you – showing
you his wonderful creation and allowing you to enjoy it forever because, in in his home, there is
no death.
It’s to this wonderful place that God is leading us. We can’t get there on our own. We need him
and his forgiveness – the forgiveness he won for us by dying on the cross for our sins and rising
from the dead so that we can live with him forever in heaven. Whoever repents of his sins (that is,
says sorry to God and means it) and trusts that God will forgive us because of what Jesus did on
the cross, that person is forgiven of all sin. He has been adopted into God’s family. He is one of
Jesus’ precious lambs whom he will continue watch, feed, guide and lead home to himself in
heaven.
Better than any rancher, Jesus is our searching shepherd, who constantly is on the lookout for his
scattered sheep. He comes to rescue us from the dangers that threaten us. He comforts, feeds and
leads us home. May these truths lead you to ever love, trust and listen to him. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",8/14/2016,
"Are wildfires good or bad? At first impulse we would say bad because they consume and destroy
vegetation. But wildfires can be good in the sense that they renew certain types of land. Sequoias
and Lodgepole pines, for instance, need the heat of fire to open their cones to disperse seeds.i
Native Americans long noted how the occasional wildfire would help forage producing grasslands
and encourage the growth of fruit bearing shrubs.ii
 This observation led them – every so often –
to intentionally set fire to grasslands. The DNR’s “prescribed” burns are a continuation of this
practice.
Wildfires are scary. They consume and destroy; but they are also beneficial and necessary. They
purge the land and encourage new growth. Let us keep this observation of nature in mind as we
meditate on our sermon text today, under the theme: Jesus’ Wildfire: 1) Kindled at his bloody
baptism, 2) is still raging throughout the world.
Part One: Kindled at his bloody baptism
Jesus once told his disciples: I have come to bring fire on the earth, and how I wish it were already
kindled!
What exactly is the fire that Jesus wanted to bring upon the earth? In our 1st lesson we heard
Jeremiah describe God’s Word as a fire; is that what Jesus is talking about here? Sort of, but not
quite. Rather (as Jesus intimates just two verses later) the fire he would bring is the division God’s
Word causes because many people refuse to accept it.
But why would Jesus want to kindle the fire of division? For the same reason the DNR might
kindle a controlled burn. You see, nobody really likes a physical fire because of the destruction it
causes. At the same time, the DNR understands that controlled burns are necessary to purge and
renew the land. 
In the same way Jesus doesn’t find pleasure in the fire of division. He wants all people to be saved
and come to a knowledge of the truth – and it’s for this very reason that he sends His life saving
Word into the world. However, here’s the problem: the sinful nature inside of man rejects God’s
Word and refuses to believe it. Why? Because it loves sin. People don’t want to be told that they
are wrong: that the things they enjoy are harmful. They don’t want to hear that they can’t save
themselves. The sinful nature is utterly opposed to God’s Word – unable to tolerate it.
But here’s the thing: without the Gospel, there can be no salvation. The truth about sin and grace
needs to be preached if people are going to be saved. That’s why, even though we don’t take
pleasure in the division this fire causes, we still rejoice that his Word is being proclaimed because
it saves and renews those who receive it in faith. How does it do that? First of all God’s law burns
away the selfishness that captivates our hearts by showing us our sins and the punishment we
deserve because of them. And then, the Gospel shows us what Jesus did to win our salvation –
telling us that, through faith in Him, we are forgiven of all sin and holy in His sight. The Gospel
gives us a new life of peace with God for all eternity.
Now, in order for God’s Word to be effective, Jesus had to accomplish what His Word said He
would accomplish: our redemption. This is why He said: I have a baptism to undergo, and how
distressed I am until it is completed!
“Wait a second,” someone might ask, “wasn’t Jesus already baptized when he spoke these words?”
Yes, he was. “Then what is this Baptism he is talking about now?” It’s a special baptism that
gives all water baptism its power to save: it’s Jesus’ baptism of blood. Let me explain what I
mean.
Baptism is basically a ceremonial washing, or purification. The purification (or baptism) Jesus
wanted to go through was a purification from all the sin he bore. You see the Bible is clear: simple
water can’t wash our sins away. “The law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood,
and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.”iii
 Jesus bore the sins of the world. The
only way he could be purified of them is through the shedding of his blood. This is exactly what
he did on the cross: shed his blood, to purify himself from all sin. This bloody baptism is the
reason our sins are forgiven – for the sins Jesus bore were not his own, but ours.
“But,” someone might ask, “if Jesus is talking about his death on the cross, why does he say that
he is distressed until it is complete?”
That’s simple: because his sacrifice for our sins would cause him great pain. Jesus did not look
forward to his suffering anymore than a pregnant woman looks forward to the pains of child birth!
And yet, just as a pregnant woman looks beyond the pain - eager to endure it so that she can hold
her child in her arms - so also Jesus looked beyond his suffering on the cross, eager to give birth
to our salvation. It’s only because he willingly went through His bloody baptism that we stand
forgiven and at peace with God.

Jesus’ bloody baptism on the cross is the spark that kindled the fire of His Gospel – a fire he cast
upon the whole earth at Pentecost when he visibly poured out the Holy Spirit on his disciples so 
that they might proclaim his life saving Gospel to the world! And do you remember the visible
sign that accompanied that event? Tongues of fire appearing over the heads of his disciples!
Sadly the devil and world stand in opposition to this Gospel. They do everything they can to
prevent people from believing it and persecuting those who do. They don’t want the LORD as
their God. They burn with hatred towards him and his followers.
Part Two: Is still raging throughout the world.
Foreseeing this reaction, Jesus warned his disciples: Do you think I came to bring peace on earth?
No, I tell you, but division.
“Now,” someone might ask, “why does Jesus say this? Doesn’t the prophet Isaiah calls him the
“Prince of Peace”?iv
 Didn’t the angels proclaim peace at Jesus birth?v On the night before his
death, didn’t Jesus say to his disciples, “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you”?vi
 Doesn’t
the Bible clearly say, “We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ”?vii
 How then can
Jesus say that he did not come to bring peace when the Bible clearly says he has?”
Yes, Jesus did come to bring peace, but not the worldly kind – as he himself once said, “Peace I
leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives.”
viii
The peace that Jesus brought is foremost a peace with God. It is the peace of knowing that our
sins and guilt have been taken away from us through Jesus’ bloody baptism. We no longer have
to fear God’s wrath. Heaven is our certain home. We also are at peace with fellow believers,
regardless of their backgrounds, culture, class or gender. We all share in the hope of salvation
given to us through the Gospel. We work together for the common goal of spreading the Gospel,
as we use our unique talents and abilities to support one another.
This wonderful peace Jesus offers to all, but, since this peace can only be received through faith,
not everyone has it. You see, the people of this world seek a different kind peace. They want the
peace of not being responsible to God. They want the peace of believing whatever they want to
believe and doing whatever their sinful hearts desire.
The world likes living in the fantasy of this kind of peace – pretending that all is right. But then
God sends his servants out to preach His Word. The world now hears the condemning voice of
God – convicting it of all kinds of evil, selfishness and sin. God’s Word tells the world that it is
corrupt and that it needs a Savior, and that Jesus is that Savior. Whoever repents of his sin and
looks to Jesus in faith will be forgiven and have eternal life. The world hears this message and
hates it. It cannot tolerate the Gospel and hates us for both believing and sharing it. And so
wherever God’s Gospel of peace is shared, worldly division and discord will soon follow, as the
devil and his allies do all they can to suppress the proclamation of God’s Word.
And no group in society is safe either. Jesus says: From now on there will be five in one family
divided against each other, three against two and two against three. They will be divided, father 
against son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother, motherin-law
against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.""
Yes, rejection of the Gospel can even tear families apart. Many of us have experienced this first
hand as we reach out to an unbelieving family member in love, only to have the person
misunderstand our attentions and attack us for what we believe. In some countries, Christians have
been killed at the hands of their unbelieving family members – all because they tried to witness
the Gospel to them in love.
The fire of division – especially when it’s in a family – is a very hard thing to face. Like a wildfire,
it rages and destroys almost everything in its path. We sometimes wonder if anything good can
come from it. Yes, God can and does allow good to come from the evil of division.
He uses it to test and strengthen us - teaching us to trust Him at all cost. He wants the exercise of
our unquestioning faith to serve as a public testimony of who He is and the love he has for us in
Christ Jesus. You see, when others in the world see our patience and hope in the face of hostility,
they may be drawn more and more to find out about the Gospel, and the hope of salvation we have.
Many people love blaming Christians for all the division and discord in the world. They say: if
only you would learn to accept people as they are without making them feel guilty, then we could
finally live in peace. But here’s the thing: without the Gospel there can be no true peace. Why
not? Because, without the Gospel, there is no salvation. But with the Gospel there is true peace,
forgiveness, life and salvation. This moves Christians to hold on to Christ in spite of the division
caused by people rejecting it.
But it can be incredibly hard hanging on to the Gospel when your family – the very people you
love the most – persecute you for your faith. How should we handle this when it happens? Handle
it in love – asking God to help you remain faithful to him as you both lovingly and prayerfully
witness the Gospel. Who knows, maybe after some time, the LORD will cause the fire of division
to die out in the hearts of our unbelieving family and friends that they might repent and believe. It
has happened in the past; whose to say it won’t happen again? More importantly, remember Jesus’
words in His sermon on the Mount: Blessed are those who are persecuted because of
righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you,
persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad,
because great is your reward in heaven.
ix

Discord and division are the wildfire Jesus’ kindled at his bloody baptism. It’s a fire that still rages
today.
Understand, however, that the Gospel did not cause this fire, rather its caused by people rejecting
the Gospel. Remember also God’s promise to work in all things for the good of those who love
him. May this truth sustain you whenever you face ridicule or persecution for the Gospel’s sake.
God will keep his promise and, in his time deliver you from it. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",8/7/2016,
"“Absolutely pointless!” says the preacher. “Absolutely pointless! Everything is pointless.” . .
. What kind of person do you imagine making such a statement? Do you picture a frustrated
worker - doing all he can to get ahead in life, only to have problem after problem prevent him?
That’s the first person I would imagine saying these words; but they aren’t from such a man.
They come, rather, from one of the richest, wisest and most successful people that ever lived:
King Solomon.
Humanly speaking, he was a man who had it all: fame, fortune and power. Everything he set his
mind to succeeded. His negotiations and trade policies made Israel so rich that he made silver
and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones.i His people loved him. Almost every world leader
respected him. He built one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world.
It is he, this wildly rich and successful man, who says: Absolutely pointless! Everything is
pointless.” . . . I hated everything I had worked for under the sun. What in the world would lead
Solomon to say such a thing? Was he going mad? No, as we will see, he was actually starting to
express true spiritual wisdom - a wisdom we would do well to listen to. Let us, then, consider
the reason behind Solomon's rant, under the theme: Wise Words from a Wealthy Man. 1)
Pursuing worldly wealth is pointless. 2) Happiness is found in Godly contentment.
Part One: Pursuing worldly wealth is pointless.
Our sermon text is taken from Ecclesiastes - a book of the Bible that King Solomon wrote late in
life. Let me tell you a little secret: I love this book. Why? Because it is wonderfully depressing
- showing us how meaningless life is without Christ! And why is that a good thing? Because it
directs us to strive for the one thing that is truly important: the salvation God offers us through
faith in Christ Jesus.
King Solomon was the wisest man there ever was. At first Solomon used his God-given talent to
glorify the LORD and lead people to him. Later on, however, Solomon started to misuse his
wisdom to sinfully pursue fame, fortune, and carnal pleasure. He succeeded at almost every
worldly pursuit - thinking all these things would bring him true happiness. But they didn't. Why
not? Because, as Solomon grew older, He came to realize that everything on this earth is
temporary - as the Scripture say elsewhere, the world is passing away.
ii
 Nothing lasts forever,
therefore nothing really matters.
This truth lead Solomon to exclaim: I hated everything I had worked for under the sun. I have to
leave it to the man who comes after me. And who knows if he will be wise or foolish? He will
take control of everything under the sun for which I worked and used my skill. This also is
pointless. Then I started to despair of everything I worked for under the sun. Here is a man who
has worked hard with intelligence, knowledge, and skill only to turn it over to one who didn’t
work for it and so it belongs to him. This also is pointless and a terrible tragedy.
As the old expression goes: “You can’t take it with you!” Everything you work hard to attain on
this earth will be left behind when you die, as Job once confessed: “Naked I came from my
mother’s womb, and naked I will depart.iii
 And then what will happen to everything you worked
for while on this earth? Someone else will get it. And what then? Will the son, daughter, friend
or relative treasure what you left them as much as you did? Will they wisely or foolishly handle
the wealth you left them? History is filled with examples of children wasting their parents’
inheritance. So many companies fall from their heights of success after an exemplary CEO
retires or dies. And why is this the case? Usually because the person who takes over never
worked hard for the wealth he inherited. How can he, then, have the same passion for it as his
predecessor?
This led Solomon to ask What does a man get for all his work and striving with which he wearies
himself under the sun? All his life is painful, and his work is troublesome. Even at night his mind
can’t rest. This also is pointless.
All the earthly things we work for and care about: are they really worth the pain, toil and
sleepless nights in the end? Are they truly worth sacrificing our relationship with God to get? If
we're honest with ourselves, we have to say: no, they aren’t.
But someone might say: at least we will have memories, and that’s something! But what good
are memories when I grow old and begin to forget? And even if I don’t forget, how will my
memories of the good things I once had, but do not have any more, actually benefit me? If
anything, they make me more miserable as I begin to long for the things I am no longer able to
have!
Solomon’s point is clear: outside of Christ, everything we work for and strive after on this earth
is pointless. None of it can offer true happiness, peace and security. None of it will save my
soul from hell? I mean, think about it: Will all my toys, gadgets, and experiences have a positive
impact on God when He raises me on the last day? Will He say to me: “Good job Michael, I am
impressed that you used everything I gave you to experience so many things in life! I am so
happy you used the gifts I entrusted you with to selfishly get more and more!”? No, that certainly
will not happen. What good is it, then, for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?iv
Oh, what a blessing it was when aged Solomon finally saw this depressing truth! Why do I say
that? Because the LORD led him back to what truly matters: not the Packers or Brewers, not our
stock portfolio or financial legacy we leave for our children. The only thing that truly matters is
the LORD and our relationship with him; as the Bible says: the man who does the will of God
lives forever.
v
Part Two: Happiness is found in Godly contentment.
This is why, after speaking about the pointlessness of striving after “things,” Solomon writes:
There is nothing better among men than eating, drinking, and finding satisfaction in your
work. I also saw that this comes from God’s hand. Without God, who can eat and enjoy himself?
The LORD who created this earth still stands in control over it. He determines when and where
people will live and what blessings they will have. Everything we have and are is from the
LORD, and how blessed we are when we acknowledge this fact. Why? Because then we won’t
worry about our life - what we will eat, drink or wear. Rather, trusting in God, we will seek first
his kingdom and righteousness, believing that he will continue to provide everything else we
need. vi
 This will cause us to look at everything we have with thanksgiving. Instead of
complaining we will enjoy the earthly blessings God gives us (whether they be many or few).
Without God’s aid it would be impossible for us to have this mindset. Like the rest of the world,
we still have a sinful, selfish nature inside of us - one that wants to be its own god and master of
its own fate. And, if it were not for the Holy Spirit’s aid and counsel, we would be like the rest
of the world - living only for ourselves and striving for more. But God, working through his
word, calls us to repent from such striving. By the power of his Gospel, he leads us to seek him
out and trust in Jesus for the forgiveness of sin, life and salvation. And when we look to Christ
in repentance and faith, then God is truly pleased with us.
And, as Solomon says, to anyone who pleases Him [God] gives wisdom, knowledge, and
pleasure - not in the earthly sense of allowing us to be healthy, wealthy and wise. Rather, the
LORD gives us these gifts in a spiritual sense. Through the Gospel, he reveals his true nature to
us: who he is, how he saved us, and the glorious future He offers us through faith in Christ Jesus.
God gives us the spiritual wisdom to apply his divine knowledge to our lives. We don’t have to
fret or worry about life on this earth. We can thank God for what we have (even if it is only a
little) knowing that he will keep his promise to take care of us. We can live in joy of knowing
that, even though the world might consider us and our work of little consequence, God loves us
and considers our station in life very important. Why? Because he put us where we are and
works through us to glorify His name.
“But,” Solomon says, “to one who lives in sin He gives the job of gathering and collecting
wealth only to turn it over to one who pleases God.” Now, someone might say, “I disagree with
Solomon. There are many godless people on this earth who are wildly successful. How does
this jibe with what he says?” Because, nothing they have will go with them when they die. No,
everything goes back to God. He will use what they left behind to accomplish his will of saving
his elect. And, even though His followers might suffer trial, hardship or want, they will, in the
end, inherit the new heaven and earth God will create for them on the Last Day.
Brothers and sisters in Christ - a lot of people pay a lot of money to hear the insights, wisdom
and secrets of the rich. Today, you have heard the advice of one of the richest and wisest men
that has ever walked this earth. Take his encouragement to heart: the pursuit of worldly wealth is
pointless. True happiness can only be found in the heart of the person who believes in Christ for
the forgiveness of sins, thanks God for everything, and trusts that, whether wealthy or poor, the
LORD will work in all things for his eternal good, just as he promised. This is the secret of
Godly contentment. This is the secret to finding true happiness, joy and meaning in your life on
this earth. May the LORD grant us his grace to take these truths to heart, and live in them.

"What is the most important activity for a Christian to be involved in? Is it visiting the sick and
shut-in? Is it maintaining this building? How about performing acts of charity and service to our
community? What about serving the Church with whatever spiritual gift God has given you?
Now, don’t get me wrong: all these things are incredibly important. However, they are of no
spiritual benefit, in and of themselves, unless they are combined with the one, essential activity
God wants all Christians to be occupied with. And what is that activity? It’s listening to Jesus
by meditating on his Word. Let us consider this truth, under the theme: Just stop, sit, and listen
to Jesus! 1) Leave your worries behind. 2) Listen attentively to His Word. 3) Apply His peace to
your life.
Part One: Leave your worries behind.
Our sermon text begins: As Jesus and his disciples were on their way, he came to a village where
a woman named Martha opened her home to him. She had a sister called Mary, who sat at the
Lord's feet listening to what he said.
Jesus’ friends - Mary and Martha - had great faith in Him, which exhibited itself in different
ways. Martha, for instance, was concerned for Jesus' wellbeing. She understood the rigors of his
ministry and wanted to make his stay with them as comfortable as possible. Everything she did,
she did out of love for her LORD – trusting that he was the Christ, the Son of God, who was to
come into the world.""
i

Mary, however, exhibited her faith in a different way. She too believed that Jesus was the
Christ; but, whereas Martha considered this fact to be the reason she ought to make serving him
her top priority, Mary viewed this fact as the reason she ought to make listening to him her top 
priority. She understood that his whole purpose in coming to this earth was to “preach the good
news of the kingdom of God”.ii
 And so, while Martha labored for her LORD, Mary listened to
him instead.
We read: Martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made.
I can empathize with Martha. There was so much she wanted to do for Jesus – and entertaining a
guest in that culture was not as easy as it is today. Water needed to be gathered from a well,
animals needed to be freshly slaughtered for their meat, bread was made from scratch, vegetables
needed to be cleaned and cooked . . . There was a lot to do. Martha must have wondered
“Doesn’t my sister care about Jesus? He’s our guest. This is his time to rest. We need to get
busy serving him and not bother him with questions.”
I can imagine Martha gave Mary subtle hints that she should help; but Mary - being absorbed in
Jesus’ teaching – probably didn’t catch them. With all that needed to be done, Martha had
enough! Thinking that Jesus would understand, she came to him and asked, ""Lord, don't you
care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself? Tell her to help me!""
""Martha, Martha,"" the Lord answered, ""you are worried and upset about many things, but only
one thing is needed. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her.""
The LORD certainly cared for Martha. He saw all that she was trying to do for Him, and loved
her. But there was one big problem: all her service was keeping her from doing the one thing He
really wanted her to do: to stop, sit and listen to him. Jesus didn’t come to Martha’s house to
cause her trouble. He came to bring her peace. And so, in a gentle way, he bids Martha to
become like Mary: to leave behind all her troubles and worries in order to listen to Him.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, it is so easy for us to be like Martha. Having experienced the
Gospel, we truly love our LORD and look for ways to serve him. Now, it certainly isn’t wrong
to serve Jesus. He appreciates the fact that our hearts are willing to do so. However, Jesus
becomes greatly concerned when our service takes priority over simply listening to His Word.
Why’s that? Because if we choose serving him over listening to him, our faith becomes “me”
focused - all about us, our love and what we can do for God. When this happens we marginalize
Christ’s awesome work for us on the cross without even realizing it. We start to become like
Pharisees – thinking we can earn God’s favor through our actions. We worry that it’s up to us to
build God’s church by keeping ourselves busy with all sorts of efforts and programs – proving
our love and dedication to God. Whenever our service to God supplants simply listening to His
Word, all sorts of worries, concerns and distractions fill our minds – drawing us away from the
one thing needful.
But here’s the thing: Jesus’ never asked us to worry about all the ways we should serve him.
What he has asked of us instead is to stop, sit and listen to him. He wants us to leave all our
cares and worries behind. He wants us to focus our attention on his Word, which records all the
wonderful things he has done for us.
Part Two: Listen attentively to His Word.
Oh, how wonderful an example Mary is for us. She didn’t just use Jesus, as her sister implied, to
get out of her work. The whole reason she stopped what she was doing is because she
recognized him as her Savior. She knew that listening to him was the greatest service she could
render him.
And so this simple woman sat at Jesus’ feet – taking on the very position Jewish students took
when being taught by their Rabbis. She absorbed herself in Jesus’ teaching – making every
effort to listen and learn. She didn’t let all the hustle and bustle of what was going on around her
deter her from listening– even if she could sense her sister’s annoyance.
And why did Mary listen to Jesus so intently? Because she believed Jesus was the Son of God.
His Words were important. And what did he tell her? What he told everyone: the good news
about the Kingdom of God. He explained to her how he would suffer and die for the sins of the
world, and be raised on the third day so that, whoever repents and believes in him shall not
perish, but have eternal life. Jesus’ taught Mary the same thing he teaches us every Sunday: He
taught Mary about God’s love for us in Christ.
And, even though the concepts Jesus taught were difficult for any human to understand, Mary
listened intently – asking Jesus to help her believe. And Jesus did help her – giving her such
insight into his work that it, at one point, surpassed the disciples. Listening to Jesus gave Mary
joy. It brought her peace – assuring her of the love God has for her in Christ. He would not
allow anyone or anything separate her from that love.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: what are some of the excuses you offer for not coming to Bible
class or reading your Bible at home? Do you find yourself thinking: “All my responsibilities are
preventing me from having private devotions. I’m just too busy.” Or how about this one: “I’m
just a simple person. The Bible is far too complex for me to understand?” If these are your
excuses, think about how Mary, who lived in a culture where everything had to be done by hand,
made time to listen to Jesus. Consider that this simple woman, who had far less education we
have, prayerfully made every effort to listen and learn. And because she did this, God blessed
her with such insight that, when the time for Jesus' death came near, she was the only person
who anointed Jesus with perfume – understanding that he was going to die for the sins of the
world.iii
All these blessings came to Mary because she made listening to Jesus her top priority:
understanding that his Word is the one thing needful. Do you understand this? Oh, may the
Lord forgive us for all the excuses we make for not taking time to listen to his Word! He wants
to strengthen our faith and set our hearts at peace through his Gospel. Understand this and make
every effort to spend some time with Jesus everyday by meditating on his Word. Maybe you can
set your alarm a little earlier in the morning and, before you grab your cell phone, take your
Bible into another room. Keep the TV and radio off. Pray: “Speak Lord, your servant is
listening,” and open the Bible to look for Jesus. He is on every page of Scripture – ready to
teach you and apply his peace to your life.
Part Three: Apply His peace to your life.
Listening to Jesus’ has an incredible impact on our lives. We have already observed how it gave
Mary peace and insight, and it does the same for us as well.
I don’t need to tell you that our world is a scary place. There is so much tragedy going on
around us - so much that doesn’t make sense. What should our response be?
Stop, sit and listen to Jesus. Meditate on his Word, and you will receive the insight you need.
The LORD will lead you to see how everything going on in the world today is happening exactly
how he said it would. More importantly, Jesus will direct you to his promised salvation that you
might have hope.
And, as the LORD applies that hope to our lives, we will become like Mary – growing in faith
and love toward the LORD. Our service will start to take on new meaning because it will no
longer be done out of guilt. No, our service to the LORD has its source in the Gospel of God’s
love for us in Christ. That Gospel invigorates us by promising that there is nothing we need to do
to save ourselves. Jesus has done it all. Through faith, we belong to him. Heaven is our certain
home.
This truth makes us look at the world differently. It gives us patience. It gives us peace. It
directs our lives as we use the spiritual gifts God has given us in service of his Gospel. As I
mentioned before: serving the LORD is important, but it should never surpass listening to Jesus.
Listening to him is the one thing needful, from which our acts of charity and love should always
flow.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: what is the most essential action you can do as a Christian? It’s
listening to Jesus with a singleness of heart. Understand how much God wants to converse with
you through his Word, and the rich blessings he offers through it. Leave your worries behind.
Listen attentively to his Word. Apply his peace to your life. Then you will experience the same
joy Mary had with Jesus – a joy that can only be brought about through faith in the Gospel of
God’s love for us in Christ. Amen.
",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",7/24/2016,
"What would you do if you had gay neighbors: would you love them or hate them? Would you
act as if there was nothing wrong with their lifestyle or condemn them every chance you got?
What if your neighbors weren’t gay, but just sexually immoral – bragging about their “love ‘em
and leave ‘em” conquests: would you treat them any differently than if they were gay?
Abraham had both kinds of neighbors. The cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, which were about as
far from Abraham’s tent as Green Bay is from our Church, were filled with gay and straight
people who exemplified sexual immorality.
i
 So what did Abraham do about it? Did he simply
accept their sinful lifestyle and do nothing? Did he wish God’s judgment on them? No, rather
Abraham prayed that the people of these cities be spared from God’s judgment.
Let us learn from Abraham’s example how we should pray for all people – even those who are
openly immoral - under the theme: A Lesson on Intercession. 1) Be concerned about your
neighbor. 2) Base your request on the LORD’s mercy. 3) Pray boldly and persistently. 4) Be
open to God’s answer.
Part One: Be concerned about your neighbor.
Before we dive into our sermon text, let us consider a little bit of the history leading up to it.
Some 25 years earlier, Abraham and his nephew Lot came into the land of Canaan together.
These two men loved the LORD and confessed their faith wherever they went.ii
 The LORD
blessed both their herds to such a degree that it became impossible for them to stay together. Lot
chose to live near the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah because the land there appeared to be good.
Abraham went the other direction towards Hebron.
The Bible describes Sodom and Gomorrah as wicked cities – filled with greed, sexual
immorality and violence. (Sadly, that description seems to fit many cities in our world today,
doesn’t it?) The lifestyle of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah distressed Lot so much that he
tried to warn them of their sin; but they refused to repent.
iii

On the day our text takes place, three men came to visit old Abraham. Two of them were angels
and the other was the LORD himself. The primary reason for their visit was to tell Abraham that
Sarah would give birth to their promised son in the next year, which gave Abraham great joy!
But the LORD also told Abraham the other reason He came: to judge Sodom and Gomorrah for
their wickedness.
Having dealt with the King of Sodom at least once beforeiv
, Abraham knew how bad these cities
were. It would have been easy for him to say: “That’s right, LORD, damn those people to hell.
Just make sure you get my nephew Lot and his family out of there before you do it.” But
Abraham doesn’t do this. He is saddened that the judgment of the inhabitants of these wicked
cities is at hand. Hoping against all hope, he wants them to be spared from the hell that awaited
them. v
 He wants them to turn to the LORD in true repentance and be saved.
And so we read: Abraham approached [the LORD] and said: ""Will you sweep away the
righteous with the wicked? 24 What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really
sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? Far be it
from you to do such a thing-- to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the
wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?"" The LORD said,
""If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.""
Then Abraham spoke up again: ""Now that I have been so bold as to speak to the Lord, though I
am nothing but dust and ashes, what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty? Will
you destroy the whole city because of five people?"" ""If I find forty-five there,"" he said, ""I will not
destroy it.""
Do you notice that Abraham, in the way he phrased his prayer, is not merely asking that the
LORD show mercy on the righteous? Rather he is asking the LORD to spare everyone in Sodom 
and Gomorrah (even the wicked) for the sake of the righteous. Why is that? Because if those
cities had any believers in them, they would be busy doing what believers do: proclaiming the
Gospel through their words and actions. And if the Gospel is proclaimed, then the people of
Sodom might come to their senses, repent of their sins and look to the promised Savior for
forgiveness. But how horrible it would be if the Lord swept away the righteous (that is, those
who believed in the LORD) with the wicked in judgment. In the eyes of the world it would
seem as if God did not differentiate between those who believed in him and those who did not.
“But,” someone might ask, “Doesn’t God sometimes allow the righteous to die alongside the
wicked? I mean, a lot of people die in disasters. Are we to assume that they are all
unbelievers?” No, we are never to assume that. Believers often die together with unbelievers in
war, terrorist attacks and natural calamities. But there is a huge difference between the
calamities of today and the judgment God brought upon Sodom and Gomorrah. The disasters we
see around us today are the natural consequences of sin being in the world. Since God nowhere
tells us that they are specific acts of punishment, the righteous can die with the wicked in the
same event. When it comes to Sodom and Gomorrah, however, God clearly tells us that the
destruction of those cities was His judgment on the wicked. On top of this, the destruction of
those cities was not a natural disaster. Rather, like the flood, it was a supernatural disaster
meant to consume only the wicked and warn all who would hear about it.
But let’s go back to Abraham. What can we learn from his prayer? First of all, we learn to care
about our neighbors - even if they are unbelievers. God does not want us to take pleasure in the
death of the wicked – just as he himself has no pleasure in their destruction.vi
 Rather, God wants
us to have the same concern for the lost that He himself has for them in Christ. He wants us to
pray for them – just like Abraham prayed – realizing that we too are every bit as sinful in God’s
sight as the people of Sodom. Maybe our sins are not homosexuality, but lust, greed, envy, and
hatred fill our hearts often enough. If we are honest with ourselves, it is only by God’s grace that
we have been led to repentance and believe in Jesus for salvation. God’s grace saved us when
we were lost in sin, therefore we plead that God would graciously save others for Christ’s sake.
Part Two: Base your requests on God’s mercy.
Ok, now that we see the importance of praying for others, how should we go about praying for
them? First of all, notice that Abraham did not minimize the wickedness of Sodom and
Gomorrah or say that they deserved a second chance. He doesn’t even say that the righteous
deserve God’s love. No, Abraham bases his request solely on the justice and mercy God
promised to have for all who believe in him.
And this is important for us to remember when we intercede on behalf of others. Like Abraham
we should acknowledge that we are dust: that we have no right to come to God on our own, or
that God should listen to us for our own sake. Rather, we trust God will hear us for his mercy’s
sake, and it’s on the basis of his mercy that we pray.
Why should God listen to our prayers? Why should God spare anyone from disaster? Jesus is
the answer to those questions. He took the sins of the world upon himself so that, whoever
believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.vii
This is why every intercession we offer should be done in Jesus’ name, acknowledging that the
only reason we can pray for anyone is because Jesus paid for that person’s body and soul on the
cross. For Christ’s sake we ask God to hear us, and for Christ’s sake He does.
Part Three: Pray boldly and persistently.
When you look at Abraham’s prayer, doesn’t it (humanly speaking) seem a little irritating? I
mean, Abraham basically kept asking God for the same thing over and over again: that the cities
be spared for the sake of the righteous – reevaluating their number as he went along. Don’t you
think God was getting a little annoyed at Abraham’s prayer? I don’t. Why? Because this is how
God wants us to pray. Using the parable of the persistent widow, Jesus once told his disciples
that they should always pray and not give up. viii

The Lord loves it when we come to Him again and again with our intercessions until he answers
them. Such persistence shows that we are concerned. When we remind the LORD again and
again of who He is and the promises He made, we show that we have not forgotten His Gospel.
We believe what He said – and this faith God credits to us as righteousness.
ix
 Let us, then, pray
boldly – trusting in the LORD’s promise to hear us for Christ’s sake. Let us, also, pray
persistently – showing how the salvation of other’s lies heavy on our hearts.
Part Four: Be open to God’s answer
Abraham asked God to spare Sodom and Gomorrah from judgement if only 10 righteous people
could be found in them. The LORD, in His mercy, agreed to that. But what is the rest of the
story? The Bible tells us that Abraham woke up to see smoke rising from the region where
Sodom and Gomorrah once stood.
Didn’t God answer Abraham’s prayer? Yes, He did. God would have spared these two major
cities if only 10 believers could be found in them. Sadly, after two decades of living and
witnessing in Sodom, Lot and his two daughters were the only believers in that entire region. He
spared them from judgement by having them flee to the nearby mountain town of Zoar. For
Lot’s sake, the LORD even spared that small village from destruction. But as for Sodom and
Gomorrah, their time of grace had come to an end.
Do you think Abraham was disappointed with God when He woke up and saw the smoke? Do
you think he shook his head and said: “Why all this destruction? I thought you were a merciful
and loving God who accepts people as they are?” No, I am convinced that Abraham did not
question God’s judgment. Abraham knew the LORD takes no pleasure in the death of anyone.
He wants everyone to repent and be saved.x But Abraham also knew the wickedness of those
cities – ever refusing to repent. Unbelief and impenitence will always result in condemnation. 
God was absolutely just in judging Sodom and Gomorrah because there was nothing left for
those cities except to serve as a warning to all who refuse to repent of sin.
What can we learn from this? Sadly, not everyone we pray for will be saved. No matter what
we do, a hardened unbeliever will continue in his unbelief and refuse God’s mercy. In the end,
he will face God’s judgment, and there is nothing we can do to change that fact. And, when it
happens, we should realize that his condemnation is not the result of God not wanting him to be
saved. Jesus died for his sins – of course God wanted him to be saved! The unbeliever’s
damnation is a result of his own continued rejection of the Gospel. If we witnessed the Gospel to
him in love, there is nothing more we could have done to prevent his fate. God’s judgment on
him is just.
The LORD listens to the prayers of all who believe in Him. He wants us to continue interceding
for our unbelieving neighbors. And how should we intercede for them? First of all, out of
genuine concern for their souls, we pray that the LORD spare them. We base our request not on
any “good” they have done, but completely on God’s mercy. We continue to pray for them in in
all boldness and persistence, trusting in the promises and hope God’s Gospel gives us. Finally,
whatever happens, we thank God for His mercy – even if it’s rejected. As the destruction of
Sodom and Gomorrah teaches, everything the LORD does is just and right. Everything He does,
He does out of love for those who believe in him. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",7/17/2016,
"I want to tell you about a special type of American warrior – without whose service our country
would have been lost ages ago. He has fought in every battle – from the Revolutionary War to
the current War on Terror. He has helped in every natural disaster. Whenever our country was
in turmoil, he was serving. Even during times of peace, this warrior has remained vigilant –
thanklessly helping our country in more ways than you can imagine.
Can you figure out who this person is? It’s the Christian, who prays for his country. Such a
person brings the needs of our nation before God’s throne – begging the LORD’s mercy for
Christ’s sake. And why does he do that? Because he realizes that, without God’s blessing, our
military would meet certain defeat, our fields would lie barren, our economy would be in
shambles, and our unique freedoms would be lost. Every good thing we have and are as a nation
is because of God’s undeserved grace.
Do you truly love this country? Are you worried about the direction it is heading? Are you
concerned for the souls of your countrymen? If you answered yes to these questions, then know
that God has a job for you. As we will learn in our sermon text for this morning, Christ wants
you to care for your country by 1) Praying for everyone – especially your leaders. 2) Sharing
the Gospel with your neighbors.
Part One: Praying for everyone – especially your leaders.
Our sermon text is taken from a letter the apostle Paul wrote to a disciple named Timothy, who
served as a missionary/pastor in Ephesus while Paul was off preaching the Gospel in Macedonia.
This letter was meant to both encourage Timothy and give good practical advice for his ministry.
Concerning the relationship a Christian should have with civil government, the apostle Paul
writes: I urge, then, first of all, that requests, prayers, intercession and thanksgiving be made for
everyone--
2
for kings and all those in authority. . .
God wants Christians to pray – and not just for their own health, wealth and good. He wants
Christians to pray for everyone. Why is that? Because, without God’s grace and mercy, not a
single soul could survive on this earth. Everything we have and are comes from Him: our
bodies, souls, employment, homes, family, etc . . . it’s all an undeserved blessing from God.
Thank God that we know this to be true, because many people live as if all these blessings were
purchased through their own hard work and effort. Many people are quick to thank America’s
founding fathers for our freedom – not realizing that, if God had not mercifully blessed their
efforts, all their work would have been in vain.
Could you imagine what it would be like to sponsor an impoverished family – providing
clothing, food, shelter and employment – only to have them act as if you did nothing? Imagine
them saying no word of thanks; instead, they boast about how their effort and ingenuity saved
them from poverty. How would you feel under such circumstances? Now consider that our
nation often acts the very same way to God! Is it any wonder that the apostle urges us, first of
all, to pray for everyone?
But how and for what are we to pray? St. Paul offers us a fourfold guideline: First of all, Paul
urges us to bring “requests” - recognizing the needs other people have and ask God to fulfill
them. What needs do people have? Certainly there are physical things like food, water, clothing
and shelter. We also have social needs, like feeling love and security. As a nation, we need
peace, safety, law and order. Spiritually, we all need to know the truth about our sins and the
forgiveness we have through faith in Christ Jesus. God wants us to ask for all these things on
behalf of our neighbor.
Secondly, Paul encourages us to “pray.” The underlying thought behind this action is God’s
honor. Here we can think about the first three petitions of the LORD’s prayer. We pray that
God allows his name to be hallowed in our land, and not abused. We pray that God’s good and
gracious will is done in our country, so that every evil plan and purpose of the devil to entice
people away from Christ is thwarted. We also pray that Christ’s kingdom spreads as we witness
the Gospel in our community, nation and world.
Thirdly God wants us to make “intercessions” on behalf of others – especially those who govern.
Ask the LORD to forgive president Obama when he errs, and to lead him to do what is good and
god-pleasing. Pray that the LORD protects him, blesses him with wisdom, and leads people to
respect his office – recognizing that he is only in power because God put him there. The same is
true regarding Governor Walker, Mayor Christman, our Supreme Court justices, our local
magistrates, and all others. Everyone in government is God’s servant whom he chose to place in
authority over us, as the Bible says: “Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities,
for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have
been established by God. . . . . For he is God’s servant to do you good.” (Romans 13:1,4 NIV84)
This is not to say that we always have to agree with every decision our leaders make. It also
doesn’t mean that we should never sound a warning when their decisions lead others into sin.
We have a God-given responsibility to speak out at such times so that others are not led astray.
But even if we had an absolutely immoral government (like the apostle Paul did when he penned
his words) that doesn’t mean we should stop praying for it. Pray in fear of God and out of pity 
for the souls of those who govern us. It would be easy to pray that God simply grants us new
leaders; but, before we pray that, shouldn’t we ask God that our current leaders recognize their
bad decisions, be led to repent and have the opportunity to correct them? Isn’t that how you
would want others to pray for you? Show, then, the same love to your political leaders.
Finally, God wants us to offer up thanksgiving. Thank for LORD for the blessings He provides
for us through the various people in society: for example, the protection our police officers,
firefighters and first responders provide. Thank God for the food our farmers grow, the health
our doctors and nurses provide, the education from our teachers, good laws from our legislatures,
and just judgments from our judges. Thank God for all he does through the various trades with
which he has blessed our nation. Consider how carpenters, masons, bankers, grocers, janitors,
librarians, stay-at-home moms, etc. . . . all have a positive impact on our lives. Thank God for
the people of our nation - all the while recognizing that God is working through their vocations
to provide everything we need.
Yes, with all the bad news going on in the world, it’s good to take time to reflect on all the good
the LORD still does through the people composing our nation. Thank God for his undeserved
blessing on our country. Ask him to continue to grant it for Christ’s sake. Why? So that we
may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.
Now understand what this last phrase means. We aren’t praying for God’s blessing so that we
can live an easy life – doing whatever our selfish heart desires. No. God grants us all the
blessings and freedoms we enjoy for his glory. As Christians, we want God to continue granting
all His blessings so that we can show Christ’s love to our neighbors in both our words and
actions. This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all men to be saved and to come to
a knowledge of the truth.
Part Two: Sharing the Gospel with your neighbors.
God loves Americans – not because of who we are or what we have accomplished. No, actually
God loves us in spite of all that! God loves the people of our country simply because He created
us. The same could be said for Russians, Arabs, Chinese Africans etc. . . God loves all people,
in spite of their sins. He takes no pleasure in the death of anyone. He would rather that they
repent of their sins and live! (cf. Ezekiel 18:32)
This is why Paul writes: For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man
Christ Jesus, 6 who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time.
Jesus paid for your sins. He paid for mine. Jesus paid for the sins of every person who has ever
or will ever walk this earth. Why? To buy us back for God. Do you want proof that God loves
you and the people of this country? Then look no further than Jesus’ cross. The Bible says that
everyone who looks to him in repentance and faith is fully forgiven. They are adopted into His
family. They have the privilege of calling God their dear Father. Through faith they become
citizens of a kingdom far greater than the United States of America: They become citizens of
heaven.
God desires the eternal salvation of all. He takes no pleasure in the death of anyone. This is why
he asks us, Christians, to both pray and share the Gospel with our family, friends and neighbors.
You see, here is the sad truth: the devil is wreaking havoc in our country. He is enticing our
neighbors away from God. Materialism is running rampant. Violence is on the increase.
Thousands of innocent babies (all of whom God created and loved) are being killed every month.
Our nation is trying to redefine morality. The demon-god of “self” is being preached. And as
this continues, our countrymen – yes, even members of our own family – are falling away.
Whether they know it or not, they running headlong into hell.
And this is why God wants you to lovingly confess His law and Gospel with your fellow
countrymen. Only the Gospel can rescue people from the curse of sin. Only it can restore a right
relationship with God. The LORD wants you to be as concerned for your countrymen as he is.
And how concerned is the LORD? So much so that He suffered and died for their sins.
We all glorify the soldier who lays down his life to protect his country. As a soldier of Christ are
you willing to do the same? The people of our nation needs men and women who are willing to
give up living for themselves in order to live for their LORD. Our country needs men and
women who are unafraid to speak about sin, and share the love of Christ through their words and
actions. This is how you can give up your life for God – all the while fighting for the spiritual
welfare of your countrymen.
America’s best defense has never been its military, government or constitution. It has always
been the LORD who has granted these blessings. It has also been Christians who pray for this
nation. For their sake, God has graciously blessed and preserved our country.
Remember the famous poster of Uncle Sam pointing his finger and saying: “I want YOU for the
US Army?” Well, God the Father wants you for his spiritual army. Christ wants you to care for
your country. How? By praying for everyone – especially your leaders. By sharing the Gospel
with your neighbors. May the LORD help us do this, not only on this holiday weekend, but
every day until He comes. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",7/3/2016,
"Two months ago I asked you to list some short term goals for our congregation. Most of you
agreed that our top priority should be reaching out to members (especially youth) who are straying
from the faith.
Now imagine for a moment that your pastor asked you to join a team that will try to engage inactive
members with God’s Law and Gospel – all in the hope of making them active again. What would
your response be? I can tell you how I would feel: I would be afraid. Why? Oh, for a number of
reasons. What happens if I say the wrong thing and I offend the people I’m trying to reach? I may
not only loose a friend, but their family might be upset with me too. I don’t like confrontation. I
don’t handle rejection well.
But here’s the thing: if no one warns the straying, how will they know the danger they are in? We
could do nothing, but is that really showing love to them? Or is it just making our life easier
because we don’t have to face the fear of rejection?
The threat of rejection makes evangelism and reaching out to the straying very difficult work. But
it is work that our Savior asks us to do and it’s work that needs to be done. How do we overcome
our fears? What do we do when our witness is rejected? Let us look to our sermon text for answers
to these questions under the theme: How to Handle Rejection of the Gospel. 1) Don’t let the fear
of it keep you from confessing the truth. 2) Don’t let the experience of it keep you from expressing
love.
Part One: Don’t let the fear of it keep you from confessing the truth.
Our sermon text takes place shortly after Jesus' Transfiguration. We read: As the time approached
for him to be taken up to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
Jesus’ Galilean ministry had come to an end. It was time for him to go to Jerusalem to be sacrificed
in payment for our sins. The people who once praised him would soon reject him – calling for his
crucifixion. Yet Jesus was determined to endure it all. Why? Because He knew how it would
end. God the Father would accept his sacrifice for our sins and raise him from the dead. More
than that, he would exalt Jesus to the highest place in heaven. Forgiveness would be won for all
so that whoever believed in him would not perish but have eternal life.
Confident in what the Scriptures said concerning His work, Jesus resolutely went to Jerusalem –
determined to preach his message of repentance and faith wherever he went.
i

Now between Galilee and Jerusalem was a region called Samaria. Most Jews travelled around that
region because the Jews and Samaritans didn’t get along. But Jesus decided to travel through it.
He wanted to preach to the people there like he did once before in another village, when he met a
woman at Jacob’s well. Many people put their faith in Him at that time. He hoped that many more
Samaritans would do the same – for the salvation of their souls.
So, he sent messengers on ahead, who went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him.
The messengers Jesus sent into Samaria could have let their prejudices and fears prevent them
from going, but, because Jesus sent them, they went willingly. They trusted in their Master's
message - remembering how much hope it gave them. And if the Gospel was able to work such
faith and hope in their hearts, the messengers were confident that it had the power to change the
hearts of the Samaritans as well.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, let us learn from the example of Christ and the messengers he sent
that the first step in handling rejection is not letting the fear of it prevent us from confessing God’s
truth. But how do we do that? First of all by understanding how utterly life-changing the Gospel
is for us, and then how needful it is for others. Let me explain what I mean.
The best salesmen are those who truly believe in their products. They love talking about their
product and answering any question people might have. They have a genuineness about them that
can’t easily be faked. They aren’t afraid of rejection. Why? Because they truly believe that their
product will improve the lives of others.
Now, if faith in an earthly product can influence people like that, how much more should the
Gospel of Christ. So, dear Christians, do we truly take the time to appreciate the great gift God
has given us in the Gospel: that, through faith in Jesus we have the forgiveness of all sin, salvation
and eternal life with God? Do we take to heart how important and life changing this news is?
Could it be possible that our fear of rejection stems a little from the fact that we don’t fully
appreciate the Gospel ourselves? If I honestly examine my own sinful heart, I see some truth to
that thought.
And this is why we need to be constantly at the foot of the cross in prayer – asking the Holy Spirit
to increase our knowledge and faith in the Bible. Our world is dying, and we have the message
that will save them. How can we not share the Gospel with those who don’t know it? How can
we not lovingly warn those who are straying? 
Lord, forgive us for the times we have failed to do this. Remind us of your love and mercy once
again. Help us see your determination to save us and, in the peace of your forgiveness, give us the
same resolve to share your salvation with others. Don’t let the fear of rejection keep us from
witnessing your truth. Don’t let our experience of rejection prevent us from showing love.
Part Two: Don’t let the experience of it keep you from expressing love.
How did the people respond to the preparatory preaching of the messengers Jesus sent? [The]
people there did not welcome him, because he was heading for Jerusalem.
Why didn’t the Samaritans welcome Jesus? Was it merely because he was Jewish, and they didn’t
want any Jews in their town? Possibly, but there seems to be more to it than that.
The Samaritans believe that Mount Gerizim was the only place God ordained for worship.ii
 The
mere fact that Jesus was determined worship in Jerusalem was a condemnation of their beliefs.
How could they accept such a Messiah?
So, in no uncertain terms, the inhabitants of that Samaritan town told the messengers that Jesus
was not welcome – all because he didn’t fit their preconceived notions of who the Messiah should
be. Based on what follows, I can imagine the Samaritans were especially nasty in their rejection
of Jesus. I can also imagine Jesus’ messengers being rather upset over the whole experience.
When the disciples James and John saw this, they asked, ""Lord, do you want us to call fire down
from heaven to destroy them?""
I don’t know if James and John were the messengers Jesus sent or if they simply overheard the
report. One thing is certain: they were mad! How could the Samaritans reject the Holy Son of
God? Remembering the Old Testament story about how Elijah called down fire on two
unbelieving companies of soldiers, they ask Jesus whether or not they should pray the same.
Now before we go on to talk about how bad this outburst of anger was, there are two positives I
have to say about James and John. First of all, their words show that they fully believed that Jesus
was the Son of God. Secondly, their response also showed that they believed what Jesus taught
them concerning prayer: that, if it is in accordance with Christ’s will, God will actually grant
whatever they prayed for – even if they prayed for a miracle. Oh that we would have such faith
in Christ and his Word today! But as admirable as these two positives are, it doesn’t change the
fact that they called for the death and damnation of an entire village! That was wrong.
Jesus turned and rebuked them. What did Jesus say? We don’t know for sure, but some ancient
manuscripts record Jesus as saying: “You do not know what kind of spirit you are of, for the Son
of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them.""
People always seem to want to “get back” at others for the insults they receive. Modern day
politics teach that all too well. If someone rejects us or publicly makes us foolish, isn’t it also our
first instinct to fume? Don’t we also want to get even – or at least have God get even for us?
But this is not the way of Christ. The Samaritans rejected Jesus - yes, that was a sin. But that
doesn’t mean that Jesus immediately wanted their damnation. No, his whole purpose in coming
to this earth was to save mankind through his suffering, death and resurrection. Jesus takes no
pleasure in the death of anyone. He certainly didn’t want these Samaritans lost in hell. So do you
know how he responded to their rejection? With love. He showed no anger or retaliation. He
didn’t beg or apologize for offending them with his message either. Jesus knew that the Samaritans
would not receive him now; in the future, however, they well might. So what did Jesus do? He
simply honored the request of the Samaritans to leave them alone and moved on to another village.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: imagine you share the Gospel in love with someone you thought
was a friend, but they reject your witness and tell you to take a hike. How should you respond?
Should you call down fire and brimstone on them? Should you apologize for trying to witness the
Gospel to them? No, rather do what Jesus did: forgive their sin and move on.
Move on? But what if we care for them? We don’t want them lost in hell. How can we just stop
caring and never talk to them again? Wait a minute. I didn’t say that we stop caring. Jesus never
stopped caring for the Samaritans who rejected him. And I also didn’t say that we never talk to
them again. Jesus didn’t do that with the Samaritans either. He still loved them – so much so that
He guided Phillip and other evangelists to spread the Gospel in that region after His Ascension.
Even John himself – one of the two that wanted to call down fire on that Samaritan village - became
instrumental in their receiving the Holy Spirit.
So when we forgive and move on after being rejected, we aren’t abandoning the people we let
alone. Rather we are trusting that the LORD, who takes no pleasure in the death of anyone, will
send other workers at different time to witness to them. Who knows, with the passing of time,
maybe we ourselves will have opportunity to witness to them again – just like John did with the
Samaritans.
So, brothers and sisters in Christ. As you all know, we have a giant task in front of us. There are
many de-churched people in our community – some of whom are even members of our
congregation. Whether the realize it or not, they are in danger of hell. They need people willing
to reach out to them with the Gospel in love. Jesus has gifted you with the Gospel and is calling
you to help. Don’t let fear of rejection prevent you from confessing the truth. Don’t let an
experience of rejection prevent you from showing love. Trust in Christ. He will use your witness
in combination with the witness of others to accomplish his will in his time. Amen.
",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",6/26/2016,
"Chucki was a troubled teen who grew up on the streets of Milwaukee. His father abandoned him
when he was young and his mother was too high on drugs to care. Social services placed him in
foster homes, but he hated them and ran away whenever he could. He learned to live on the streets
– doing what he felt he needed to do in order to survive. The only love and support he found was
from a local gang.
After getting arrested for a misdemeanor and ending up in juvie, he was placed with a pastor. The
pastor was patient with Chuck – even though he ran away a few times and the cops had to bring
him back. The pastor slowly built a relationship with him – treating Chuck as his own son by
showing him undeserved respect, love and dignity. Chuck calmed down after some time. He
grew to respect and love the pastor. He quit the gang and, after a while, became the pastor’s actual
son through adoption.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, on a spiritual level our lives are similar to Chuck’s. No matter how
religious and church going our parents were, we were all born into this world spiritually sinful,
troubled and broken. Abused by the devil, world and our sinful natures we were harassed and lost.
But then it happened. For some of us it happened very early in life and for others it was later.
God took us into his care and adopted us as his dearly loved sons through faith in Christ. Why?
Simply because He chose to!
Let’s consider how God’s underserved love has changed us, under the theme: Celebrate your
Heavenly Father’s Love. 1) Through faith in Christ, you are His Son. 2) Through faith in Christ,
you are united with His other children 3) Through faith in Christ, you are His heir.
Part One: Through faith in Christ you are His Son.
Did you ever hear the story about the baby God found? It goes like this: One day God was looking
over his creation and he heard the sound of a baby crying. When God looked at the baby, he saw
that it was an abandoned newborn and that it was also in great danger. The devil was prowling 
around near the child. He too heard its cries and was about to kill it. God couldn’t let that happen,
so do you know what he did? He snatched the child away from the devil.
God carried the dirty, crying baby home in his arms. While giving it a bath, he said: “Hush my
child, don’t cry. You are safe. I have washed away all the filth you were born with. I am clothing
you with the righteousness my Son Jesus won through his perfect life, innocent death and glorious
resurrection. You belong to me.” And then he turned to the angels of heaven and said: “Do you
see this baby? I adopt this child as my own. Watch over him. Keep him safe from the devil. If
he wanders into danger, warn him. Direct him to my Word that He might always know my love
and not run away.”
Do you want to know which saint the baby in this story grew up to be? It’s you. That’s right: you
are the baby God adopted in this story. Everything I described happened to you at your Baptism.
While your pastor held you in his arms, poured water over you and said: “I baptize you in the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit” - God the Father held your soul in his arms
and washed you clean from all sin. He clothed you with Christ’s righteousness and declared to all
the saints and angels of heaven: “Listen everyone to what I have done: I have sent my Spirit to
create faith in this child’s heart to receive the forgiveness my Son has won for it. From now on
whenever I look at this child I will see my Son and love him as such.”
How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And
that is what we are!ii
 How can we know that this is true? Because the Bible says: You are all sons
of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed
yourselves with Christ.
Think about what this means: you don’t have to go through life trying to earn God’s favor. You
already have it through faith. And notice that God doesn’t just call you his child. He calls you his
Son. Why? Because whenever He sees you He sees Jesus – His one and only Son. He sees Jesus’
record of keeping the law perfectly for you. He sees Jesus’ sacrifice for your forgiveness. You
are a Christian. You bear the name of Christ. You are God’s Son.
OK, now that we have established the wonderful relationship we have with God through faith in
Christ Jesus, the next question we should ask is what does being God’s son mean for our lives?
Does it mean that we can live however we want and expect God to bless us? Does it mean that I
can pursue whatever sin I want – knowing that God will love and forgive me in the end?
Absolutely not! God did not save us from the consequences of our sins so that we could willingly
go back to pursuing them.
Remember the story I told you about Chuck? The pastor did not take him into his house so that
he could continue being a gangbanger and break the law. No, he took Chuck in so that He could
offer him a new life – one with purpose and meaning. I also mentioned that the pastor was patient
with Chuck. Don’t interpret that to mean that the pastor let him do whatever he wanted to do. No,
there were rules and if the rules were broken, there would be consequences. The key, however, is
that, even when it came to discipline, the pastor made it obvious that everything he did was done
out of love.
The same is true in our relationship with God. Being his Son through faith does not mean we can
do whatever we want. Rather, as God’s children, we want to obey and please him. And just as
any good parent sets rules and enforces them to benefit their children and help them grow, so also
the LORD uses his Law to protect and benefit us. He may discipline us when we sin, but we need
to understand that this discipline is for our good. It teaches us to avoid sin. God’s discipline is
meant to keep us from great harm. And what is that harm? Running away from him and into the
devil’s trap. You see – he is still out there, prowling around like a lion, looking for someone to
devour.iii
Part Two: Through faith in Christ, you are united with His other children
That’s why, when God made us His sons, he also did something else: he united us with other
people from all over the globe into one family in order that we might help and encourage one
another. St. Paul writes: There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you
are all one in Christ Jesus.
Now please understand these words correctly: the apostle Paul is not abolishing the various roles,
vocations and stations God has established on this earth. God has given humanity a wonderful
diversity. We are not all the same – nor would it be beneficial if we were. When it comes to our
faith, however, Christians are united. We don’t look at each other as different or not belonging
due to our race, age, gender or station. We are one in Christ – forming one body.
And it’s important that we see each other this way. Why? Because this is how God sees us. And
if God sees Jesus in each and every one of us, shouldn’t we see Jesus in each other? Think of the
effect this will have! If we see Jesus in each other, we will be less quick to judge and more willing
to forgive. If we see Jesus in each other, we will be more likely to bear patiently with each other’s
annoying opinions, habits and sins – remembering how Jesus bore with ours. If we see Jesus in
each other, we will learn to value each other – always ready to defend, help and love one another
as the brothers and sisters in God’s family that he declared us to be.
Through faith in Christ, God has united us together as a band of brothers. Do any of you remember
the miniseries by that name: “Band of Brothers”? It was a dramatized retelling of the history of
""Easy"" Company (a group of American paratroopers during World War II). Why do I mention it
now? Because that mini-series showed how very different men grew together as a Band of
Brothers – caring for each other as they worked together to survive and accomplish their mission.
We too are at war. We too are very different and unique from each other, and yet, in Christ, the
LORD has made us a band of brothers. Each one of us is important to one another. Together we
march into the fray. Together we fight. Together we storm the devil’s stronghold with the Gospel
– confident of the victory we have in Christ.
Part Three: Through faith in Christ, you are His heir.
St. Paul says: If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the 
promise.
God’s love in adopting us as his sons in baptism and uniting us together in faith was all for a
purpose: that we might share in the inheritance he promised Abraham. And what is that in
heritance? It is God himself – all that He is and has - for all eternity. Since God has covered us
with Christ’s righteousness through faith and declared us to be his sons, then it stands to reason
that he will also give us the life and glory that He gave Jesus.
And the Bible also says as much. In another place, St Paul once wrote: The Spirit himself testifies
with our spirit that we are God's children. Now if we are children, then we are heirs--heirs of God
and co-heirs with Christ, if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in
his glory. . . He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all--how will he not also,
along with him, graciously give us all things?iv

Jesus himself said: ""Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. In my
Father's house are many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to
prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to
be with me that you also may be where I am.v
Brothers and sisters in Christ – as you remember your earthly fathers today; don’t forget to
celebrate your Heavenly Father’s love for you. Through faith in Christ he has made you his son.
Through faith in Christ he has united you to a family of believers that cares for you. Through faith
in Christ, he has made you his heir. Let these truths guide you through out your life – motivating
you to obey God’s commands and live your life in hope. Amen. ",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",6/19/2016,
"How would you react?
Imagine a well known homosexual comes to worship the same day we’re having a potluck.
After the service he goes down into the fellowship hall and, after finding where I am sitting, runs
up and hugs me - all the while crying loudly. What kind of thoughts would be running through
your head? Would you be concerned for the man, or feel uncomfortable and somewhat annoyed
that he showed up? Would you consider him the very picture of faith, or somewhat troubled and
unstable? And what would you think about me - the person he’s hugging and crying over?
As you probably figured out: the situation I described is very similar to what happened to Jesus
in our sermon text. A sinful woman was making a scene. Everybody watched her, and yet only
Jesus saw this woman for who she truly was - holding her up as an example of repentance and
faith. Let us consider these things, under the theme: Do you see this woman? 1) She came to
Jesus a sinner. 2) She left Jesus a saint.
Part One: She came to Jesus a sinner.
We don’t exactly know when or where our sermon text takes place, but at some point, early in
Jesus ministry, one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to have dinner with him.
Why would a Pharisee invite Jesus to dinner? We don’t know. Perhaps Jesus just gave a
discourse in the synagogue and the Pharisee wanted to find out more about him. Regardless of
the reason, Jesus accepted the invitation - so he went to the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the
table.
Now, before I go on, I should explain that the Jews in Jesus day did not “sit” for dinner like we
do. They used dining couches instead of chairs and would lie on their sides perpendicular to the
table. Knowing this will help you picture what happened next.
When a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that Jesus was eating at the
Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster jar of perfume, and as she stood behind him at his
feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Then she wiped them with her hair, kissed
them and poured perfume on them.
Who was this woman and why was she there? Did the Pharisees “plant” her in the party to test
Jesus? The way our text is worded in its original language makes it obvious this was not the
case. She came uninvited. But how did she get in? Well, you have to understand that this dinner
party was not like the typical dinner parties we have in our day. The door was open. People
could come and go as they pleased. Picture it as being like a church potluck or an open house
graduation party. Maybe then your can understand how she was able to get in.
But here is the thing: no one expected her. She was a known sinner in the community, someone
whom the Pharisees would openly condemn. The last place you would expect her would be in a
Pharisee’s house, surrounded by his friends. And yet, there she stood. She crashed this party to
see Jesus. And when she saw him, she broke down crying. Stooping over Jesus she let her many
tears wet his feet. She let down her hair - a woman’s pride back then - and wiped his dusty feet
clean with it. She applied a sweet smelling ointment and kissed his feet as tenderly as a father or
mother might kiss their child. She did all this in front of everyone.
You have to understand how shocking this situation was. Jewish men did not usually speak with
female strangers, let alone allow themselves to be touched or kissed by them. Jewish women
would never let down their hair in public, let alone wipe someone's feet with it. And yet all this
happened to Jesus, who said nothing.
When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If this man were a prophet,
he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is—that she is a sinner.”
Notice how quickly the Pharisee judges - not just the woman, but Jesus as well. If he would
allow an unclean sinner to touch him like that, then he, obviously, couldn’t be a prophet. 
Jesus knew what was in the heart of this Pharisee. He also knew what was in the heart of this
woman. Everyone saw her as a dirty, troubled sinner who was not worth the effort to save.
Jesus, however, saw in her the kind of person God loves: a repentant sinner. She trusted that
Jesus was her promised Savior. And even though no one in her community loved her, she
trusted that He would. She heard his preaching on repentance and the forgiveness of sins. The
Holy Spirit awakened a faith in her heart that believed that, no matter how sinful she was, Jesus
would forgive her. And this is why she had to see Jesus. She wanted to express her repentance
and faith in him. And this is why she boldly did what she did - not caring what people might
think of her. Her entire focus was Jesus.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, do you see this woman? She was not afraid to come before Jesus
as a sinner. She was not afraid of the condemning eyes of the Pharisees. All that mattered to her
was Jesus and the forgiving love he promised to all who turned to him in repentance and faith.
What matters to you? Are you willing to be like this woman and approach Jesus with all your
sins hanging out there for him to see? Are you willing to suffer public shame for public sins - as
you openly confess them to the LORD? Or do you hide behind a mask of propriety - telling
yourself that you are a good person who doesn’t really have many sins that need to be confessed?
So often we can be like Simon the Pharisee - coming to Jesus with our works. We think that
what we offer God is really something when it, in fact, is nothing at all - just like the Pharisee’s
dinner. But the truth is that God is never impressed with the great works we might do to earn his
favor. What he wants is for us to acknowledge the truth about ourselves and our need for him.
King David once wrote: You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take
pleasure in burnt offerings. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite
heart, O God, you will not despise. (Psalm 51:16-17 NIV84).
Jesus wants us to come to him with all our sins - laying them all at his feet as the woman in our
text did with her tears. It is only when we do this that we can rise forgiven - holy and free from
all sin.
Part Two: She left Jesus a saint.
Jesus knew what Simon was thinking. He could have easily let it pass, but he didn’t. He loved
this Pharisee too. This is why Jesus answered him, “Simon, I have something to tell you.” “Tell
me, teacher,” he said. “Two men owed money to a certain moneylender. One owed him five
hundred denarii, and the other fifty. Neither of them had the money to pay him back, so he
canceled the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”
To put the parable in modern terms, who would love the merciful moneylender more: a man
forgiven a $2900 debt, or the man forgiven $29,000?
Simon replied, “I suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceled.” “You have judged
correctly,” Jesus said. Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, “Do you see this
woman? I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet
with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from
the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil on my head, but she has
poured perfume on my feet.
It was common courtesy in Jesus day to offer guests water to wash their dusty, dirty feet, and
olive oil as a balm from the hot, dry sun. Friends would also greet each other with a kiss - sort of
like the French do. Simon didn’t do any of these things and thereby revealed his true feelings
about Jesus: that he was no-one to be concerned about.
And why did Simon view Jesus in this way? Because he wasn’t looking for a Savior. He didn’t
think that his sins were all that bad that they needed to be forgiven. He convinced himself that
he could please God on his own. Therefore he never entertained the thought that Jesus was his
Savior.
The sinful woman, however, saw Jesus as her Savior and loved him dearly. She knew her sins.
She trusted in his forgiveness. This is why she expressed her love the way she did.
“Therefore,” Jesus said, “I tell you, her many sins have been forgiven—for she loved much.” Or
to say it another way: “All her sins have been forgiven her - proof of this fact is how willing she
is to express her love.” But he who has been forgiven little loves little. That is to say: “If a
person does not think they need the forgiveness I offer, well then they will treat me like you
treated me, Simon. Their lack of love proves that they don’t believe or value the salvation I
offer.”
Then Jesus said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” The other guests began to say among
themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has
saved you; go in peace.”
The woman looked to Jesus in faith, and Jesus forgave her. And notice that Jesus didn’t say: “I
forgive you from this point on, because you showed love to me.” No, he says that her sins are
forgiven. In other words, they were forgiven before she came to the house. Because she trusted
Jesus’ promises, she received what He offered. She was at peace with God and could start a new
life - leaving her sinful ways behind and living as His dearly loved daughter, certain of the
eternal life he offered.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: learn from this text. Our sinful human nature often gets us to act
like Simon. We hide our sins so well that we hide them from ourselves. We are tempted to view
ourselves as good people who don’t need to be forgiven all that much. When we do this, we lose
our appreciation of what Jesus did for us. And why is that? Because we no longer see his work
as vital as it actually is.
Be like the woman in this text. Understand how horribly evil you are and acknowledge your
sins. Come to Christ in repentance - trusting in his mercy to forgive. Lay your sins at Jesus
feet, just as the woman did, and leave them there. Trust that he has already taken care of them
because His resurrection proves that he did. 
Do you see this woman? My prayer is that, in seeing her, you see yourself in her. Come to
Christ a sinner and leave a saint: a forgiven child of God. Forsake your sinful ways and, with his
strength, live to his glory. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",6/12/2016,
"It will happen at some point in your life: someone you love dearly will die. At such a time, many
confused thoughts will go through your head. You may wonder: “Why did the LORD take him
away from me? Doesn’t He care? Doesn’t God see how much I need him? Who will take care
of me now? I feel so lost, overwhelmed and alone.”
Facing the death of a loved one is probably one of the hardest things we have to go through in
life. During such a time God feels so far away. The cold chill of death prevents us from feeling
the warmth of his love. And so, even if we are able to keep our eyes dry, our souls weep.
At times like this it is good to remember the comfort the LORD offers us in this morning’s
sermon text - which we will consider, under the theme: ""Don't Cry” 1) Jesus’ heart goes out to
you. 2) He raises the dead.
Part One: Jesus’ heart goes out to you.
Our sermon text takes place shortly after the events discussed in last week’s sermon, when a
centurion in Capernaum sent representatives to Jesus to ask him to heal his servant by the power
of his Word. Jesus granted that request, thereby revealing himself as the Messiah.
We read: Soon afterward, Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd
went along with him.
Why was there such a large crowd following Jesus? I am sure that many, like his disciples,
followed to hear him teach. Others, however, probably followed him in the hopes of seeing
some sort of miracle. Little did they realize how great a miracle Jesus would perform.
Nain, Jesus intended destination, was located in the southern part of Galilee - bordering on
Samaria. It was a small walled city with one gate. We are not told why Jesus wanted to go to
Nain. Was it to preach there? Probably. But I don’t think it is wrong to imagine that Jesus, with
his divine foreknowledge, already knew the plight of the widow and went there to help her - all
to the glory of his name.
12 As he approached the town gate, a dead person was being carried out—the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.
Just picture the scene: from the north, Jesus approached the city with a large crowd of peoplehappy
and eager to hear him preach. From the south came a large funeral procession of people
crying and wailing as they walked. And this was no ordinary funeral either. A woman, who
already lost her husband, had to now deal with the death of her one and only son. And not only
did she love him dearly, but he was her only family. Without him, she had no financial support.
She pretty much lost everything when he died.
And now, in the narrow gate of Nain, joy and sadness, hope and despair, and life and death meet.
The living Son of God the Father looks on the dead son of a human mother. And, when the Lord
saw her, his heart went out to her.
The word translated in our text as “his heart went out to her” could be more literally translated:
“his gut moved.”
Have you ever felt such compassion and pity for a person that your stomach literally hurt for
them? This is how Jesus - the almighty LORD - felt for this woman. He was not indifferent to
her sorrow.
But why? She doesn't seem to have been a relative. The Bible doesn’t name her. I am sure that
were many other widows throughout Judea who lost sons. Why does Jesus single her out?
The answer? Grace. Jesus, being God in human flesh, loves the widow for no other reason than
that He simply chose to love her. She may be nameless to us, but not to God. He knows the
name of every person on this earth. Every one of them is his lost creation whom he knows more
intimately that we know ourselves. He knows our sins, sorrow and the fact that we deserve
nothing from him, and yet his heart goes out to us individually - just as it went out to this widow.
The LORD takes no pleasure in the death of anyone. He says so much in his Word.i
The whole
reason he came into this world is to pay for our sins so that, through faith, we might be rescued
from the threat of eternal death in hell.
Jesus loved this widow. His heart went out to her in her sorrow. Just as a mother tries to gently
hush an upset toddler who has just been hurt, so Jesus says to the woman: “Don’t cry.” - tenderly
inviting her to trust in him and his love. He was about to do something no one else could do:
give her genuine comfort and joy.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, whenever we face the death of a loved one, remember that the
same Jesus whose heart went out to the widow of Nain, goes out to us as well. Even though we
don’t see him, he is nevertheless present. With his Gospel promises He picks us up in his arms
and says: “Hush, my child. I know you hurt. I feel your pain. Hush my child, I understand why
you are sad, but you don’t have to grieve like those who have no hope. Trust in me. I will make
everything better because I am your Savior from sin. I am your God. I have power to raise the
dead. Hush my child and don’t cry. ”
Part Two: He raises the dead.
I wonder what the widow's reaction was when she first saw Jesus. Did she stop crying at his
word - looking to receive whatever comfort he would offer? I can imagine her doing that - even
if she didn’t know who he was.
What Jesus does next is a remarkable demonstration of love. Then he went up and touched the
coffin, and those carrying it stood still.
Jewish law was clear - touch a corpse or anything it is touching and you become ceremonially
unclean. No rabbi or priest would think about touching a coffin like Jesus did - especially when
you consider that Jewish coffins were really open biers with no cover or sides on them. At yet,
Jesus willingly touches it - ready to make himself unclean in order to help the widow.
This is not the only time Jesus made himself unclean to help someone. He did it for us as well.
Just think: Jesus, the sinless Son of God, took all our sins upon himself in order to rescue us from
the eternal death that threatened our souls. Our sins made him totally unclean, and as such He
suffered God’s most severe wrath and punishment on the cross. He did this willingly - knowing
what would happen to Him. He did this to give us life.
After Jesus touched the dead son’s coffin, He revealed his power for all to see. He said, “Young
man, I say to you, get up!” The dead man sat up and began to talk, and Jesus gave him back to
his mother.
In last week's Gospel reading, we heard the centurion confess: “Say the word, and my servant
will be healed.” Here we see Jesus demonstrating just how powerful his Word is. Just like
Elijah in our Old Testament lesson, Jesus raised a widow’s son and gave him back to his mother.
But unlike Elijah, Jesus did not ask God the Father to raise the dead. He did it all on his own
authority. He said, ““Young man, I say to you, get up!” and the dead man sat up and began to
talk.
This is why, when the people saw the miracle, they were all filled with awe and praised God. “A
great prophet has appeared among us,” they said. “God has come to help his people.”
I don’t know whether or not the people understood exactly what they were saying. Jesus is not
just “a” great prophet; He is “the” great prophet the LORD promised Moses when Israel was
about to cross into Canaan.
ii
 Jesus is the promised Messiah. And the LORD did not simply
come to help his people through Jesus. The LORD has come to help his people as Jesus. Jesus is
the LORD. He is Immanuel: God with us. 
And, as our Immanuel, Jesus has real power over death. The resurrection of the widow’s son is
not some parlor trick or made up story. It was performed in the open before two large crowds of
witnesses. This is why this news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding
country.
As I mentioned before, the account of Jesus raising the dead widow’s son gives us awesome
comfort as we face the death of our loved ones. How so? First of all it shows that, even though
we may feel otherwise, God is not distant. He is close by and cares when we hurt.
Secondly, this account shows us the power Jesus has over death. What Jesus did for the widow’s
dead Son he will do for all at the end of time. St. Paul once wrote: “Brothers, we do not want
you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep, or to grieve like the rest of men, who have no
hope. We believe that Jesus died and rose again and so we believe that God will bring with Jesus
those who have fallen asleep in him. According to the Lord’s own word, we tell you that we who
are still alive, who are left till the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have
fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the
voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.
After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds
to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage each
other with these words.”iii
And so, my brothers and sisters in Christ, when you face the death of a loved one and are
tempted to cry out in anger: “Why did you take him from me, LORD? Don’t you care? Don’t
you see how helpless I am without him?” remember this account. The LORD does see. He
knows. He cares. Through the Gospel, He takes you in his arms and says: “Hush, my child:
don’t cry. Remember what I did for the widow of Nain? I will do the same for you too. Know
that I am here. I will take care of you, because I am your Savior and youGod. Trust in me and
don’t cry. I feel for you. Put your hope in me, for I will raise the dead on the last day.” Amen.
",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",6/5/2016,
"The scene is all too familiar at a non-Lutheran funeral. A man gets up to speak about the
deceased, saying something to the effect: “Jane was a good person. Look at everything she did
for her family and community. If anyone deserves to be in heaven, it is Jane.”
What do you think about statements like that? Does our own “goodness” in life earn God’s
favor? Does the LORD want us to point to either our own deeds or the deeds of others as the
reason why he should hear our prayer? “Lord, you have to help my friend. Look at all the good
he has done for others. He deserves your help!” If God is not moved by such a prayer, what
moves Him?
With the account of the Centurion of Capernaum as our guide, let us answer these questions,
under the theme: Our Worthiness before God 1) does not come from who we are and what
we’ve done. 2) It comes through faith in Christ’s undeserved mercy for us.
Part One: Our worthiness before God does not come from who we are and what we’ve done.
Our sermon text takes place almost immediately after Jesus preached his famous Sermon on the
Mount. We read: When Jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people, he entered
Capernaum. Jesus had made that little city his home base for all his mission work in Galilee. It
was Peter’s homei
and the place where Matthew collected taxesii before becoming a disciple.
Jesus performed many miracles in that town.
iii He even healed a demon possessed man –
probably in the very synagogue mentioned in our text.iv
 He was, therefore, well known in
Capernaum – not only to the Jews, but among the Gentiles as well.
There a centurion's servant, whom his master valued highly, was sick and about to die.
Centurions were highly respected military officers in charge of 100 Roman soldiers. From the
little information we can gather about this particular man, it seems as if he was the very
definition of what it means to be “good.” He was well respected by the Jewish community
(which was no small feat for a Roman soldier). He seemed to have treated his servants humanely
and with respect – even going so far as to seek help when a particularly well-liked slave was
lying paralyzedv
and near death. But the most stand out feature of this centurion was that he was
a “Gentile believer” – someone who adhered to the Jewish religion, but had not undergone
circumcision.
3
The centurion heard of Jesus and sent some elders of the Jews to him, asking him to come and
heal his servant.
Wow: Jewish elders agreeing to speak to Jesus on behalf of a gentile Roman soldier? This
almost seems like a miracle in and of itself. It speaks volumes as to the kind of man the
centurion was. Most Jews hated the Roman occupation of their land; but they didn’t hate this
guy. He expressed love for the Jews, their culture and, most importantly, their religion. Could
you imagine if some rich person had built this Church for us - paying for it completely out of his
own pocket? This is what the centurion did for the Jews in Capernaum.
Is it any wonder that the Jewish elders granted the centurion’s request? Of course they would
bring his appeal before Jesus. In fact, they had such admiration for the centurion that they
decided to do more than he asked: they would take it upon themselves to convince Jesus that the
centurion was worthy of his help!
4 When they came to Jesus, they pleaded earnestly with him, ""This man deserves to have you do
this, 5
because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue.""
Brothers and sisters in Christ, did you notice anything wrong with the way the Jews presented
their appeal to Jesus? It’s not found in what they are asking, but in why Jesus should grant their
request. “This man deserves to have you do this,” they claimed.
Was that true – did the centurion “deserve” Jesus help because of all the good things he did?
Well, let me ask you this: Does a servant “deserve” his master’s praise for simply doing his
duty? Does a child “deserve” to be rewarded with candy for simply obeying its parents? If the
answer is no in these cases, then how can a sinful human “deserve” anything from his almighty
and holy God? We are his creatures, not his business partners! On top of this, God demands
perfect love and obedience to his Word. Was the centurion perfect? He would be the first to
confess he wasn’t; and that is exactly why he appealed to Jesus for help.
Jesus went with the Jewish elders – not because the centurion’s good deeds compelled him to
help, but because of the centurion’s humble faith in Christ that would soon be revealed.
Part Two: Our worthiness comes through faith in Christ’s undeserved mercy for us.
It seems as if someone from the meeting with the Jewish elders must have run back to tell the
centurion about the conversation they had. This news disturbed the centurion. Why? Because
they misrepresented him and his request! For this reason, when Jesus was not far from the house
. . . the centurion sent friends to say to him: ""Lord, don't trouble yourself, for I do not deserve to
have you come under my roof. 7
That is why I did not even consider myself worthy to come to
you.”
The centurion was well acquainted with Jewish law. He knew that Jesus could be considered
ceremonially unclean if he entered his house.vi
 That would cause Jesus undue trouble, and the
centurion didn’t want that. Why not? Because the centurion believed that Jesus was the
Messiah – the LORD incarnate. Through the words of his friends, the centurion confessed: “I
am an unclean sinner and am unworthy of your mercy. And yet I call to you for help, dear Jesus.
Why? Because I know who you are and firmly believe what the Scriptures say about you and
your love.”
Here’s another problem: if Jesus were to come into the centurion's house now to heal his servant,
that would be to the centurion’s glory instead of Christ's. How so? Because everyone had heard
the Jews explain that he “deserved” this miracle. The centurion did not want that. In everything,
he wanted Christ’s name to be glorified. For this reason he says: “But say the word and my
servant will be healed.”
And what was the centurion’s reasoning behind this strange request? He says: 8
For I myself am
a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and that one,
'Come,' and he comes. I say to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it.""
In other words, the centurion is saying: “I am a man subject to others. You, however, are subject
to no one. If I, someone who is subject to the authority of others, can simply speak and have my
servants do my bidding, how much more will all heaven and earth do what you command - since
you have all authority and are subject to none?”
9 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him.
Think about this verse for a moment. Jesus, the almighty God, was amazed. At what? The good
deeds this centurion performed? No, rather at the humble faith this centurion confessed. He, a
gentile, saw, understood and believed what few Israelites did: that Jesus is the Messiah. The
centurion did not come before Jesus relying on his works, but on God’s mercy. In no way did he
try to glorify his own name, but sought Jesus' glory in everything. He freely confessed his
uncleanness and unworthiness. And yet, this did not stop him from expecting Jesus’ mercy and
love. Why? Because the Scriptures promised it!
Turning to the crowd following him, [Jesus] said, ""I tell you, I have not found such great faith
even in Israel.""
Since the centurion, through his humility and faith, sought to glorify Jesus’ name above all else;
Jesus’ honored the centurion by publicly praising his confession and faith. Jesus also granted the
centurions' request, as we read
10 Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well.
Let’s go back to our original question: does a person’s “goodness” ever make him deserving of
God’s favor? The answer is clear: Our worthiness before God does not come from who we are
or what we have done. Being sinners, we have no right to expect anything but eternal wrath and
punishment from him – even if we lived a most helpful and self-sacrificing life. No, our
worthiness can only come from Jesus’ work on our behalf. He lived the perfect life we all failed
to live - thereby winning the righteousness we need to stand before God. He suffered death on
the cross in payment for our sins - thereby forgiving them in full. We receive these gifts of
God’s love only through repentance and faith. In other words, our “worthiness” to receive God’s
favor does not come from within us. It is given to us as a gift, for Christ’s sake.
And so the proper way to approach God is not by confessing our deeds, but our need for the
forgiveness and mercy he offers us in Christ, as the Scriptures say: 16 You do not delight in
sacrifice, or I would bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings. 17 The sacrifices of God
are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.vii

God wants us to come before him with humble hearts that joyfully believe his promises. Yes, we
deserve nothing, and yet we can expect to receive everything. Why? Because He promises to
answer us for Christ’s sake. Like the centurion, we can make bold requests before God to heal
friends who are sick, and rescue those facing any problem. We can make these requests trusting
that Christ will hear us and do what we ask – all according to his will and to the glory of his
name.
Our Worthiness before God does not come from who we are and what we’ve done. It comes
through faith in Christ’s undeserved mercy for us. May the Holy Spirit prevent us from ever
forgetting this wonderful truth. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",5/29/2016,
"Dana, Dylan, Michael and Tanor: I’ve got some good news and bad news. The bad news is that
you have finished your confirmation instruction. “Bad news?” you might be thinking, “How is
that bad news?” Well, I didn’t say it was bad news for you – it’s bad for me. I’ll miss having
you in class. But here is the good news: as you will learn in today’s sermon, you aren’t done
studying yet!
We went through a lot of stuff together in catechism class. But as much as you have learned,
you have only scratched the service of everything Jesus wants you to know about him and his
will for your life. This is why God instituted a continuing education program for his Church –
one in which He wants all Christians to enroll. What is this program, and why is it important?
Our sermon text will answer these questions, under the theme: God’s Continuing Education
Program. 1) There’s still more we need to know. 2) The Holy Spirit teaches us through His
Word.
Part One: There’s still more you need to know.
One temptation Christians face after confirmation is the idea that we have learned all that we
need to know in Catechism class. An older gentleman once asked me: “If I went through Sunday
School and was confirmed, why do I have to keep on studying the Bible - if I already learned
everything I need to know for my salvation?”
Well, the simple answer to that question is this: Jesus, your Savior and God, has much more he
wants to say to you. He says so much in our sermon text for today,
Here’s the situation: Jesus was gathered with his disciples on the night before his crucifixion.
They had spent 3 wonderful years with him – seeing his miracles and learning from his teaching.
Could you imagine going into a three-year mentoring program with Aaron Rodgers – living with
him and learning to eat, drink and breathe football? I could imagine that after such a long time 
of intensive study, you would think you'd have learned everything you could from him. But
listen to what Jesus says in regard to his disciple’s intensive study with himself: I have much
more to say to you, more than you can now bear.
Jesus’ earthly ministry was coming to a close. Very soon he would visibly return to his Father
and the disciples would be left to carry on the work of witnessing his name on this earth. Jesus
foresaw the hatred the world would have towards them because of him. Depending on where
they lived, society would pressure them either to revert back to Judaism or to adopt the
hedonistic practices of the pagan world. They would be dragged before princes and emperors –
told that they could either deny Christ and live, or continue to confess Christ and die. Were the
disciples ready for such a life? Even though Jesus did a perfect job teaching them, he knew that
they weren’t ready. The human brain can’t grasp all knowledge at once. The disciples needed
some form of continuing education.
Since yesterday was Armed Forces Day, let me use military training as an illustration to explain
what I mean. Basic training is incredibly important. The training learned there keeps a soldier
alive. And yet, would you say that a soldier straight out of boot camp is ready for the battlefield
- that there is nothing left for him to learn? Absolutely not. There are things that only
experience and a veteran soldier’s mentoring can teach. Without such help, a greenhorn would
have a hard time staying alive - let alone accomplishing his mission.
What is true for the soldier is true for us as well. Your Sunday school and catechetical
instruction were like basic training. In this instruction you learned the truth about God: who he
is and who we are in relationship to him. We are sinners who deserve God’s eternal wrath and
punishment, and yet God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16 NIV84). You learned how God
the Father sent the Holy Spirit to awaken and strengthen faith in our hearts through his means of
Grace: the Gospel in Word and Sacrament. Throughout your instruction, the craftiness of our
enemies (the devil, world and our sinful flesh) have been impressed upon you. Left to ourselves,
we are powerless against them. But God has not left us alone. The Holy Spirit is with us. He
gives us the victory as we stay close to him and his Word.
Yes, you have learned a lot in confirmation instruction, but you also haven’t learned nearly
enough. The hostile world that faced Jesus' original disciples faces you also. As you move on to
high school and college, you too will face pressure to give up your faith and adopt the hedonistic
practices of this world. Your friends and even your own flesh will tempt you day in and day out.
Our American society is becoming more and more godless by the minute. You will be facing
challenges to your faith that your grandparents never dreamed of. Are you really ready for this?
Not without help! And this is exactly why Jesus established a continuing education program –
not only for his disciples, but for all of us as well.
Part Two: The Holy Spirit teaches us through His Word.
Nothing teaches a person like hands-on experience. This is why many important jobs – like
being a teacher, nurse, doctor or pastor – require some sort of internship. The great thing about 
being an intern is that you have an expert mentor who can help guide you when difficult
questions come your way.
After telling his disciples that there was more for them to learn Jesus promised: 13 But when he,
the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth.
The Holy Spirit is our mentor-teacher. He was given to the disciples at Pentecost and has
remained with the Church ever since.
Now please understand what the Holy Spirit is and isn’t. The Holy Spirit is not some feeling
inside of us or divine force that influences our will. No, he is a real person – just like the Father
and the Son are – united with them in a mysterious way that we can’t even begin to comprehend.
The Holy Spirit is God – just as the Father is God and the Son is God. And yet there are not
three God’s, but one God.
Being true God, the Holy Spirit does not teach anything contrary to what the Father and Son
teach. This is important to know because there are many false teachers in the world who teach
dangerous doctrines that are not in the Bible. And how do they defend them? By claiming that
the Holy Spirit has given them some direct insight. Could that be true – could the Holy Spirit
actually teach us something new or different than what the Bible says? Absolutely not! Listen
to what Jesus says regarding the Spirit:
He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to
come.
14 He will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you. 15 All
that belongs to the Father is mine. That is why I said the Spirit will take from what is mine and
make it known to you.
The Holy Spirit doesn’t speak to us through our feelings. He never promised to whisper in our
ear. No, the way the Holy Spirit instructs us is through His Word that He – together with the
Father and the Son – had inspired holy men to write down in the Bible. As we prayerfully study
the Scriptures, He opens our eyes to see and hearts to believe in Jesus as our Savior. And after
we spiritually digest God’s Word, the Holy Spirit then helps us apply it to our lives. He reminds
us of God’s promises during difficult times: that our sins are forgiven and that he will work in all
things for our eternal good.
Now someone might ask: “If Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to instruct us in all things as we meditate
on God’s Word, why do I still struggle to understand it? Why isn’t reading the Bible easy?”
Let me answer that question with an illustration: Imagine two interns studying under two
different doctors. When faced with a problem, one doctor always told his intern what to do
without letting him struggle to figure it out on his own. The other doctor did the opposite. He
always let his intern struggle - forcing him to think things through to the end. Which doctor was
the better teacher? The one who made his intern struggle. Why? Because the process of how to
diagnose a problem is just as important as the solution itself. The struggle taught the intern many
things that an easy answer wouldn’t.
In the same way, the Holy Spirit is an expert teacher. When we have a problem, he often lets us
struggle with Scripture. Why? Doesn’t he know it frustrates us? He does this because He wants
us to learn more than the answer to our problem. He wants us to think through God’s word:
living in it and making it our own. He wants us to know how to correctly interpret the Bible in a
world that is constantly twisting, and changing it. The Holy Spirit lets us struggle because He
wants us to learn what trusting in Jesus really means.
This is God’s continuing education program: He offers us the Holy Spirit to teach, instruct and
guide us in all truth. And how do we enroll in this program? We don’t because Jesus has
already enrolled us through Holy Baptism, when he sent the Holy Spirit into our hearts. Through
every stage in life the Spirit has been with you – teaching you the things God wants you to know
and believe through faithful pastors, teachers and parents. He instructs you through the means of
grace. The Spirit guides you as you wrestle with God’s Word.
Continue wrestling with God’s Word, then. Make a plan to read your Bible. You don’t have to
read huge chunks – maybe start with a chapter or half chapter a day. Start with one of the
Gospels. Ask the Holy Spirit to help you see Christ in everything and start reading and
rereading. Ask questions and search the Scriptures for God’s answers. Don’t just read the Bible
at home, continue coming to worship and receiving Holy Communion. Join a Bible study, and
learn from the experience of other Christians. This is how you can encourage each other and be
encouraged. You can be confident that the Holy Spirit will instruct you through these means and
guide you into all truth. He will strengthen you to be his faithful witnesses on this earth, and
protect you from every evil that threatens your soul.
Tanor, Michael, Dylan and Dana: you have finished your basic training and are about to be
confirmed as Christian soldiers. Rejoice in this fact - but also realize that there is still much
more Jesus wants you to learn. Join both me and other members in making regular use of God’s
continuing education program: 1) There is still more we need to know. 2) The Holy Spirit
teaches us through His Word. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",5/22/2016,
"What do you think about Financial Investment commercials - you know, the kind thatshow smiling
people living their dreams, all because they worked hard and invested wisely? Do you find them
appealing - encouraging you to think about your own goals and what you can do to attain them?
The life goals people set for themselves usually have to do with either how they can live
comfortably, securely and well; or how they can make a name for themselves by leaving their mark
on the world. While it is not necessarily wrong to have such goals, we have to be careful with
them. Why? Because God has other goals and priorities that he wants us to pursue. He wants our
lives to glorify him and not ourselves. He wants us to find our comfort, security and well being in
our relationship with him, and not in the things of this earth.
The Christian life is not about what we can attain for ourselves. Rather, it’s about Christ’s kingdom
and the role God has graciously given us in it. Let us consider these things, under the theme: What
Do You Want to Build? 1) People want to build monuments to themselves. 2) God wants to
build his Church.
Part One: People want to build monuments to themselves.
Our text takes place about a hundred or two years after the Flood. Do you remember why God
sent that great disaster? It was because the people of the world had grown wicked. They refused
to believe and obey the LORD. Worst of all, they refused to repent and be forgiven.
After the flood, believing Noah and his family were the only humans left on the earth. Over the
years they grew in number. It was now time for them to “fill the earth” as God had commanded
Noah (cf. Genesis 1:28, 9:1), and this is where our text breaks in:
Now the whole world had one language and a common speech. And why was that? Because they
all came from one family.
As men moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.
A few hundred miles - that’s as far as the human race got from Mount Ararat, where the ark had
settled. They found themselves in a beautiful, fertile plain between two rivers. As they looked
around, they thought they had all they needed: fresh water, good soil and favorable weather. “Why
move from here?” And so, instead of pitching tents, they planned to do something else:
3 They said to each other, ""Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly."" . . . ”Come, let us
build ourselves a city, with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for
ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth.""
No temporary mud houses for these folks. They wanted to stay in Shinar forever. “Who cares that
the LORD commanded them to inhabit the whole earth.” they thought, “He’s just keeping us from
enjoying life.” They didn’t need the LORD. They had themselves. They would build a fortified
city. Within its walls they would be safe. They would build a tower reaching into the heavens -
showing how great they were. Future generations would thank them - maybe even consider them
gods for what they accomplished.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: take a moment to reflect on the goals of these people. Their desire
for earthly sustenance, security and status drove their actions more than the LORD’s loving
command. Just like Adam and Eve, they wanted to be like god and control their own destiny.
Instead of trusting the LORD, they thought that He was trying to prevent their happiness. Their
desire for the things of this world moved them to rebel.
Is it any different today? People are still driven by their earthly passions. The desire to live
comfortably, securely and well still directs all worldly decision making - even if those decisions
go against God’s clear Word. “Glory to man in the highest!” - this was humanity's song on the
plains of Shinar; and it still is man’s mantra today.
And we, dear Christians, are not immune to this thinking either. All of us have a corrupt, sinful
nature that seeks to fulfill its own will instead of God’s. Think about it for a moment: why do we
do the things we do? For example, why do we invest money for our retirement? Do we do it to
the glory of God: so we will have money to live on and support the Gospel in the future, or do we
invest merely so that we can live comfortably? Why do we work so hard? Is it because we are
concerned about the spread of God’s kingdom, or merely to get more toys for ourselves? What do
you want to build? An earthly life and name for yourself that will perish? That’s not God’s desire
for you. He wants you to enjoy the eternal pleasures of living with him forever in His kingdom.
To this end He is always working - even when He allows bad things to come into your life. This
point is clearly made by what happens next in our text.
Part Two: God wants to build his church.
The human race was busy on the plains of Shinar: working together in harmony to build a
wonderful city. Seeing this would have been a beautifulsight, if it weren’t for the fact that mankind
was united against the LORD. What would happen if they succeeded? Things would be as bad as
they were before the flood.
This is why, when the LORD saw the city and the tower that the men were building. 6 The LORD
said, ""If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they
plan to do will be impossible for them. That is to say: left unchecked, humanity will continue to
plan and do great evils against the LORD. Left unchecked, humanity will even ruin God’s promise
of the Savior!
The LORD truly disliked what he saw happening on the plains of Shinar. Humanity had to be
stopped, and yet the LORD didn’t want to destroy them. He wanted to save them. This is why,
instead of wiping those rebels out, our loving, triune God said: “Come, let us go down and confuse
their language so they will not understand each other.""
Without a common language, people would not be able to communicate their ideas with one
another. More than that, their sinful natures would kick in and start to view others with suspicion.
They would no longer unite against God. Frustration and fear would drive them to the ends of the
earth - to the very places God intended them to go until His promised Savior would be revealed.
And as the LORD willed it, so it happened: the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth,
and they stopped building the city. 9 That is why it was called Babel--because there the LORD
confused the language of the whole world. From there the LORD scattered them over the face of
the whole earth.
Luther once commented that what happened at Babel was a more severe judgment on mankind
than the Flood. The Flood only affected one generation, but what happened at Babel has affected
every generation since. Racial suspicion, fear, bigotry and hostility all have their roots in this one
event. How many wars and other evils haven’t resulted from this? Be that as it may, the LORD’s
judgement at Babel was also an act of underserved love. It saved humanity from itself. No matter
how much mankind unites against God, the LORD will not allow humanity to prevent him from
doing what He promised: sending Jesus to die for the sins of the world so that, whoever believes
in him will not perish, but have eternal life. To this end God is always working.
And this brings us to Pentecost. God had kept his promise to send a Savior. Jesus accomplished
our salvation through his perfect life, innocent death and glorious resurrection. Before He
ascended into heaven, he promised to give the disciples the gift of the Holy Spirit so that they
could go into the world to preach the good news of Christ’s salvation.
On Pentecost, God fulfilled that promise. Not only did he send his Spirit, he also gave his disciples
the ability to speak the native language of each person gathered in Jerusalem from every nation
under heaven. In doing this, the LORD undid Babel’s curse. He provided a rallying point for all
people to come together in perfect unity and love. And what is that rallying point? It’s the good
news of God’s love for us in Christ.
Jesus is not just a Jewish Savior. He is the Savior of us all. He broke down the barrier and
destroyed the dividing wall of hostility that not only existed between us and God, but also between
us and the rest of humanity as a result of Babel. Christ came to make us one united family again,
members of one great city. This city is the Holy Christian Church - the new Jerusalem. In this
city God feeds us with his Gospel. He keeps us safe from all harm. He gives us an eternal name
that far exceeds anything we could have hoped to obtain on our own.
Through faith in Christ, we are members of God’s Church; and as such God wants us to go out
into every nook and cranny of this world where there are people: telling them that God has fulfilled
his promise and sent his Savior. God promises to use our witness to gather his elect from every
tribe and nation. He will gather them into this new city - just like he gathered us.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: What do you want to build? A comfortable earthly life, dedicated
to self but that will soon perish? Or do you want to be a coworker with Christ - using the time,
talents and gifts God has given you to help build the eternal Church of God? For this purpose the
LORD forgave all your sins and adopted you into his family through Holy Baptism. Let us, then,
follow the Spirit’s leading and dedicate our lives to the Gospel - doing all we can to preserve and
share it. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",5/15/2016,
"There are few things more precious to a child than a mother’s love. I see it in my own family.
When hurt or needing help my kids often pass right by me - looking for Mom. Why? Because,
from before they can remember, she has fed, clothed, nurtured and cared for them.
The wonderful relationship God intended earthly mothers to have with their children serves as a
good illustration of the relationship God the Father wants Christians to have with the Church. Let
us consider these things under the theme: Find joy in your mother’s arms! 1) Drink her spiritual
milk. 2) Enjoy the blessings she has to offer. 3) Receive the comfort God gives through her.
Part One: Drink her Spiritual Milk
Our text begins: ""Rejoice with Jerusalem and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice greatly
with her, all you who mourn over her.
In this verse, the LORD calls believers to be filled with absolute joy and gladness over the Church.
“Over the Church?” someone might ask, “Doesn’t this verse talk about having joy and gladness
over Jerusalem?” True, it does say that. However, it is important to understand is that the Bible
often uses Jerusalem as a symbolic name of the Church. Why? Because just as God dwelt in the
temple amongst the people of Jerusalem, so God dwells within his Church today.
Why are believers supposed to be bursting with joy in regard to the Church? The next verse
explains it:
For you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts; you will drink deeply and delight in
her overflowing abundance.""
We find joy in the Church because she is our spiritual mother. Now, a mother with a newborn is
a wonderful thing to see. A baby cries and nobody but mommy can comfort it. When she comes
close, baby reaches out to her in anticipation. Mommy holds baby to her chest - close to her heart.
Peace is in the air as baby drinks mommy's nourishing milk that it loves beyond anything else.
After baby is done, joy and contentment fills its face. Every bone in baby's body is happy and its
face gleams from the love and nourishment it has just received.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, we are, spiritually speaking, the baby, and the church (Christ's bride)
is our mother. She nourishes us with the milk of the Gospel in Word and Sacrament. The Gospel
is the good news that God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever
believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16 NIV84) And just as a baby lies
close to its mother's heart and feels her love as it drinks her milk, so we lay close to God's heart
and experience his love as we gather together around the Gospel.
St. Peter once wrote: “Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow
up in your salvation.” (1 Peter 2:2 NIV84) As milk is for the newborn, so the Gospel is to us. It
strengthens our faith, comforts our hearts and keeps us spiritually alive. And yet, even though we
know this to be true, how often don’t we turn our back on our spiritual mother and refuse to take
the milk we so desperately need? We do this by not making worship and Bible study a priority in
our lives. And why do we do this? Does a baby refuse the milk its mother offers or nurse only a
few times a year? Think of the blessings we miss by not regularly coming to worship and Bible
study: things like receiving a deeper knowledge of God, a greater assurance of his forgiveness and
a greater appreciation of his love.
Dear Christians, find joy in your mother's arms! Come and drink in the Gospel of God's love for
you in Christ, which He offers you through this congregation's ministry. Then your soul will be
exceedingly happy and bursting with joy.
Part Two: Enjoy the blessings she has to offer.
For this is what the LORD says: ""I will extend peace to her like a river, and the wealth of nations
like a flooding stream; you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees.
A mother doesn’t just show her love by nursing a baby. She also plays with her child, hugs it, and
carries it close to her. This is the LORD’s will for the Church as well. Through the Church, God
gives his children many blessings, the foremost of which is “peace.”
The peace that the LORD provides through His Church is different than the peace the world offers.
The Hebrew word for peace is ""shalom"" and it includes the idea of completeness, wholeness, and
health. I guess the best way to explain God's shalom is to illustrate it: Have you ever seen a
beautiful sunrise over lake Michigan and had a sense of peace fill your heart as you saw the
breathtaking colors reflected in the water, heard the slight breaking of the waves and felt the clean
brisk air? It's amazing, and yet - for some reason - there was still some emptiness inside of you. 
You didn't quite feel complete. Have you ever felt that way: at peace and still empty inside? Well,
God’s peace fills everything up - including the emptiness worldly peace cannot fill.
The peace the LORD offers through His Church is, first and foremost, the peace of knowing that
our sins are forgiven and that, through faith in Jesus, we can stand before Him without fear. The
peace God offers through the ministry of His Church is the knowledge that, no matter what trouble
comes our way, He is with us. The LORD will deliver us safely though this earthly life to himself
in heaven.
But the blessings don’t stop there. God also promises the ""wealth of the nations,” which include
all the talents, abilities, and experiences that all the different cultures in the world have to offer.
How do we receive the wealth of the nations through the church? Well, take a moment to look
around you. What do you see? I'll tell you what I see: a rather diverse group of people with
different talents, abilities and experiences from whom I can learn! And this is just the tip of the
iceberg. Through faith in Christ we are connected to a much larger network of people from every
nation on this earth. The wisdom of Jewish Solomon, the insight of African Augustine, the bold
confession of German Luther – their writings are just a few treasures the church possesses and
enjoys. Our hymns span culture and time. Their various ways of expressing the hope we have in
Christ gives us great comfort, encouragement, joy, and rest in any time of need.
God says that, through his Church, peace will flow like a river and the wealth of the nations like a
flooding stream. So, members of Immanuel, look around you once again. Do you see your
spiritual mother? Do you see the Church? It's not this building. The people who surround you
and confess the same faith you confess is the Church. Find out more about one another. Love each
other. Draw from one another’s experiences and encourage each other with the Gospel. Work
together - not just on Sunday, but everyday. Then you will certainly experience the wealth of the
nations. Then you will understand what it means to be carried on your spiritual mother's arms and
dandled on her knees.
Part Three: Receive the comfort God gives through her
The LORD says: As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you;
The word translated here as “child” is really the word for a full-grown man. A mother never stops
loving her child, no matter what age he or she is. And even though that love is great, it pales in
comparison to the love and concern God has for us in Christ.
Yes, God has great compassion for you. He loves you so much that he gave up his dearest treasure.
How many of you, parents, would be willing to let one of your children die a horrible death to save
someone who hates you? But this is what God did for us in Christ. And because He did that, we
can be sure that the LORD will continue to show his compassion to us through the ministry of His
Church, as our text continues
And you will be comforted over Jerusalem. A more precise translation of this verse is: “you will
be comforted through Jerusalem. The LORD comforts us through the ministry of His Church. 
The Gospel in Word and Sacrament, together with the prayers, support and fellowship of all
members of this congregation are the tools God uses to help, comfort and encourage us.
And this comfort strengthens us. As we minister to each other and allow others to minister to us
we grow together in love - ever appreciating the brother and sisterhood we share in Christ.
When you see this, your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass.
God certainly blesses us through the Church. He nourishes us with His Word and Sacrament. He
gives us each other to strengthen one another, to find eternal friends, and to share His great love.
Doesn’t knowing all this make you want to shout for joy? Doesn’t it make you want to enjoy each
other’s fellowship all the more?
No, we are not a perfect congregation. Being sinners, we often tarnish the joy God offers through
the Church. At the same time, none of our tarnishing can take away the great love God offers us
through the Gospel. His grace is infinitely more powerful than our sins could ever be.
The LORD has made Immanuel — not the building, but the fellowship of believers that gathers
here — your spiritual mother, and he will continue to show love to you through this church as long
as it stands. Find joy, then, in your mother’s arms! Come and drink her spiritual milk! Come
and enjoy all the blessings she offers you! Come and receive the awesome comfort God offers
through her. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",5/8/2016,
"Did you notice something strange in this evening’s sermon text? It says that, after seeing Jesus
ascend into heaven, the disciples worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.
Great joy? Doesn’t that seem a little odd to you? I don’t know about you but I always get choked
up when family or friends leave after a visit - let alone move to some place where I rarely see them.
If I were one of Jesus’ first disciples, I could imagine myself being filled with sadness - not joy.
Why? Because my dear friend and teacher is gone. Whom would I run to now with all my
questions and problems? On top of this, I would feel a little fearful. Those same enemies who
crucified Him were still in charge over Jerusalem and Judea. Who's to say that they wouldn’t be
looking to kill me too? And then there was his talk about me being his witness to the world. Would
I be ready for such a task – after only three years of training?
Sad, alone and afraid: this is how I could imagine myself after seeing Jesus ascend into heaven;
but the Bible tells us that this was not the case with the disciples. Joy replaced their sadness and
courage replaced all fear. Why? Because they understood what Jesus’ ascension meant. Let’s
consider this, under the theme: Joy in Jesus’ ascension. 1) It assures us that our sins are forgiven.
2) It assures us that Christ is in control. 3) It assures us that He is coming back.
Part One: It assures us that our sins are forgiven.
You have probably heard it said that Jesus’ resurrection is the clearest proof that our sins have
been forgiven. While this is certainly true, a close second assurance of our forgiveness is found in
Jesus’ ascension into heaven.
Think about it for a moment: sin caused all mankind to be cast out from God’s presence. No sinful
human is allowed to come before God and live. Why not? Because God can not tolerate sin.
But then there is Jesus. Even though he is true God from eternity, he is also true man – just like
us. In fact, Jesus represents all of us. How so? Because, even though he committed no wrong,
God placed all our sins on Jesus to such a degree that he became sin personified - representing the
whole human race on the cross. God punished Jesus for all those sins. He died. He rose again.
And because He rose, He is now represents the human race as being forgiven and justified. 
The fact that Jesus – a true human being – ascended into heaven shows that the human race has
been reconciled to God. This fact gave the disciples great joy and I pray that it gives you joy as
well.
Does some sin from your past still haunt you today? Remember that Jesus bore that sin on the
cross for you. It has been paid for in full. And because Jesus, who bore your sin, was raised and
welcomed into heaven, you can be absolutely sure that, when your last hour comes, you too will
be welcomed into heaven. Through faith in Jesus, you are reconciled to God.
Yes, Jesus' ascension gives us joy. It assures as that our sins are forgiven. Let us now see how it
assures us that he is in control.
Part Two: It assures that Christ is in control.
Another remarkable result of Jesus’ ascension is that the disciples were no longer afraid. Just
think, 40 days earlier, when the resurrected Christ first appeared to them, they were meeting
together behind locked doors – afraid of what the Jews might do to them. Even when Jesus
appeared to them again a week later, they still kept the doors locked.i
 And can we blame them?
The same people who crucified Jesus were still in control over Jerusalem. What would prevent
those Jews from going after Jesus’ disciples?
But look at the disciples now after Jesus ascended into heaven: at Christ’s command they joyfully
go back to Jerusalem - waiting for Him to fulfill his promise. And they don’t meet behind lock
doors either; rather they stayed continually at the temple, praising God. Do you know who were
also at the temple? The High Priest, Temple Guards, Sanhedrin and, right next to the temple, Pilate
himself. Let that sink in for a moment: after Jesus ascended into heaven, the disciples publicly
met in the midst of all their enemies – joyfully and openly praising Jesus!
Think of the irony: Before Jesus’ ascension they acted like scared little church mice, but now that
he ascended into heaven they were more courageous than a squad of Navy SEALS? Why?
Because they trusted Jesus’ promises.
On numerous occasions Jesus told his disciples that he would return to his Father and their Father
to take his rightful place at God’s right hand. Jesus promised that he would not leave his disciples
as orphans, but would send the Holy Spirit to counsel, guide, and protect them. Not only that, but
he promised that he himself would be with them – even though they couldn’t see him.
These promises and seeing Jesus ascend into heaven encouraged the disciples. They thought:
“Jesus is on God’s throne. He is ruling everything for the benefit of his Church. His resurrection
proves he has power over death. There is no reason for me to be afraid: Jesus is in control, and
will keep his promise to work in all things for the good of those who love him.”
So, we can see how the disciples were emboldened by Jesus’ ascension into heaven, but what about
us? Do we live in the same confidence the disciples did – even going so far as to confess Christ
in the heart of enemy territory? Sadly, if we are honest with ourselves, we often act more like the 
disciples before Jesus’s ascension – huddled together in fear over what’s going on in the world.
We are afraid that if we speak too boldly against sin, we might become targets of internet rage,
social shaming or lawsuits. We’re afraid that friends will disown us and our community hate us
for being too zealous for the Gospel. Seeing the rapid change in our society and the worldwide
persecution of Christians, we want hide – closing our eyes and ears to everything, pretending that
it’s a bad dream and that, if we ignore it, it will all go away.
But, brothers and sisters in Christ, it will not go away. These are all results of the devil snuffing
out the proclamation of the Gospel. The only remedy is a bold witness of the truth – just like it
was for Jesus’ first disciples in Jerusalem. Take heart: Jesus rules. He is in control over all things.
Fight the good fight. Witness your faith. Yes, you might suffer. You might even physically die.
But Jesus promises to be with you through it all. If people hurt you, he will heal you. If people
insult you, he will defend you. If people kill you, he will raise you to life. Our world needs to
hear the Gospel of Christ. Our society needs to know why it stands under God’s wrath so that
people might repent and be saved. Our world needs a clear witness of the truth given in love. And
Jesus promises us his same presence and same Spirit that he gave his original disciples. Christ
will keep his promise because He ascended into heaven and sits at the right hand of God.
Jesus’ ascension gives us joy. It assures us that he is in control. It assures us that he is coming
again soon.
Part Three: It assures us that He is coming back.
One of the most comforting promises Jesus gave his disciples before he ascended into heaven was
that he was coming back. Even after he ascended, he sent angels to reassure them of that promise:
""Men of Galilee,"" they said, ""why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus, who
has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you have seen him go into
heaven.""ii
Jesus is coming back. His visible absence is only temporary. Yes, we are sad that he is gone but,
in view of what he is doing for us, we are also happy that he went! Why is that?
Well, imagine a father telling his daughter that he is going to Wyoming to pick up a new, special
pony for her from a renowned horse breeder, and that he might be gone for few days. That daughter
will certainly be sad that her father is gone, but she will also be happy that he went away. If he
didn’t go, how would she ever get her pony? Happy that he left, she will also eagerly wait for his
return. Because of the pony? Yes, but not only for the pony. She will also look forward to being
with her Dad again and enjoying her new pony with him.
This is how the disciples viewed Jesus’ ascension into heaven, and this is how God wants us to
view it too. Jesus went into heaven to get a special gift ready for us. True, we are sad that he is
gone, but we are also glad because we know why he went: to prepare paradise for us. 
And this is why we eagerly look forward to Christ’s return: when he comes back, He will bring all
of heaven with him so that we can enjoy that blessed place of sinlessness, joy and perfection with
him for all eternity.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, I hope you have seen why meditating on Jesus’ ascension is such an
important and comforting thing for us to do. Whenever you feel lonely or scared – wondering
where Jesus is and how you can face life, ask God to give you joy as you remember the meaning
and promises of Christ’s ascension: 1) It assures us that our sins are forgiven and that we are,
therefore, at peace with God. 2) It assures that Christ is in control, working in all things for our
good. 3) It assures us that He is coming back to take us to live with him forever in paradise. For
all these reasons, Jesus' ascension truly gives us joy. Amen. ",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",5/5/2016,
"It almost always happens: at some point in a pastor’s ministry he receives “a divine call” to serve
some other place with the Gospel. What exactly does receiving a “divine call” mean? Is that
merely a fancy way of saying that he has another job opportunity? And what’s this talk about
prayerfully “deliberating” a call and “being led” to either accept or return it?
With the account of God calling Paul to Macedonia as our guide, let us consider these things
under the theme: The Spirit leads us where Jesus needs us. 1) Sometimes he says “No.” 2)
Sometimes he says “Go.”
Part One: Sometimes he says “No.”
What is a “divine call”? Basically, it’s God telling a person to publically preach the Gospel at a
specific time and in a specific place.
How does God issue a divine call? Well, he can do it directly – like appearing to someone in a
vision or talking to them from a burning bush; but usually he does it indirectly: commissioning
his chosen ministers through the Church.
Take, for example, the apostle Paul: Right before our text, the church in Jerusalemi
commissioned him to encourage congregations in Asia Minor with a special message. Even
though he heard no voice from heaven, Paul viewed this task as work that God himself wanted
him to do.
After completing that important ministry, Paul returned to doing the work the Holy Spirit had
originally called him to do: spreading the Gospel in Gentile lands.ii

Paul made a plan as to how he would go about this ministry. He thought it would be best to start
by preaching in the neighboring province of Asia, but when he set out to do that, look at what 
happened: Paul and his companions. . . [were] kept by the Holy Spirit from preaching the word
in the province of Asia.
Now, why would the Holy Spirit prevent Paul from preaching the Gospel in that particular
province? Was it because God didn’t want those people to hear the Gospel? No, that was
certainly not the case. Paul himself would preach there at a later date. Right now, however, the
LORD wanted Paul somewhere else. This is why he led Paul along a road that went along the
border of Phrygia and Galatia to a place called Bithynia.
“Ah ha,” Paul must have thought, “God wants me to preach here!” But when they tried to enter
Bithynia . . . the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to.
Now why didn’t the Holy Spirit allow them to enter that region? Was it a matter of timing?
Well, it was actually more than that. Even though the Christians in Bithynia would play a very
important role in future Church history, God had not chosen Paul to evangelize that region. He
chose someone else to do it.
Now think about this for a moment: Even though the Holy Spirit led Paul right to the border of
Bithynia, He, in the end, said: “No, Paul. I am not sending you here. I have chosen someone
else to conduct ministry in this place. Continue travelling the road I set you on and I will bring
you to where you need to be.”
Brothers and sisters in Christ, I want to pause at this point in our text and apply it to present day
ministry. Just as God called and directed his apostles of old, so he calls and directs his ministers
today. Faithful pastors and teachers don’t pick and choose the places they want to serve. The
Holy Spirit leads them to the places he wants them to serve – and he accomplishes this through
the divine call.
So imagine the situation: a faithful minister of the Gospel receives a call to serve someplace else.
Does the fact that he received this divine call mean that he is obligated to accept it? No, not
necessarily. Think of the example we have of the apostle Paul at the border of Bithynia: Even
though the LORD led him to that place, the Holy Spirit also made it clear that he didn’t want
Paul to preach there. In a similar way, after careful deliberation, the Holy Spirit may also make
it clear to a present-day minister of the Gospel that he needs to stay in his present place of
ministry.
How did the Holy Spirit prevent Paul from entering Bithynia? Did a geo-political conflict in the
area physically prevent Paul from crossing the border? Did the Holy Spirit simply speak to him
in a vision? On another occasion, it seems as if the apostle's health played a role in where he
preached the Gospeliii. Was that the case here? We will probably never know the answer to
these questions this side of heaven. The important thing to note is this: the Holy Spirit, in some
way, led Paul to the conviction that the LORD did not want him to conduct ministry in Bithynia.
So also today: whenever a faithful minister of the Gospel returns a divine call, it is only because
he is convinced that the Holy Spirit wants him to stay. What leads him to that conviction? Who
can say in general because each situation is unique. It could be that, upon further review, he 
came to the realization that he is unqualified for the new call. Medical issues could prevent him
from accepting. During the course of his deliberation, new problems, challenges or opportunities
might come to light in his current place of service, which he is best suited to address. Regardless
of how it happens, whenever a faithful minister of the Gospel returns a call it is only because the
Holy Spirit led him to that conviction.
So, as you can see: The Spirit leads us where Jesus needs us. Sometimes he says “No.”
Sometimes he says “Go.”
Part Two: Sometimes he says “Go.”
I wonder what the Apostle Paul and his companions were thinking as they travelled those
hundreds of miles northwest from Pisidian Antioch. They seemed to be going nowhere - passing
major city after major city. What was the LORD doing? Where was he leading them?
Soon Paul and his companions ended up in Troas, which was literally the end of the road on
which they were travelling. They physically could not walk any further. Now what? Well, the
LORD showed them what: 9 During the night Paul had a vision of a man of Macedonia standing
and begging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.”
Understand that this vision was no ordinary dream. It was special. It was distinct. It was the
Holy Spirit’s way of laying on Paul’s heart a desire to share the Gospel on the continent of
Europe.
The people in Macedonia were in need: they were trapped in Satan’s clutches, slaves to sin,
living in unbelief, dying and doomed to hell. They had no knowledge of their Savior.
Paul and his companions had the message they needed to hear: that God so loved the world that
he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal
life.iv
 Not only did they have that message, but God had also specially gifted Paul and his
companions with the talents and ability necessary to effectively witness that Gospel in Europe.
We read: 10 After Paul had seen the vision, we got ready at once to leave for Macedonia,
concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
What convinced Paul that God had called them to preach the Gospel in Europe? Was it just the
vision? That was certainly a major reason behind his conviction, but the way this verse is
worded in Greek there were other reasons as well. After Paul received the vision, it seems as if
he thought through his entire journey up until that point: the fact that the Holy Spirit had
prevented them from doing ministry in Asia and Bithynia, and that the LORD had led them to
the edge of the continent with no place to go except across the sea – all these things, together
with the vision, gave Paul the conviction that God wanted them in Macedonia. God showed
them the need. He gave them the desire to help. All these things combined were the Holy Spirit
saying: “go”.
What the Holy Spirit did for Paul and his companions, he also does for his faithful ministers of
the Gospel today. No, I am not saying that he gives us a vision as to whether or not we should
accept a divine call. He gives us something better: he gives us conviction!
Now, please understand what I mean when I say “conviction”. I am not saying that a pastor
simply feels the “fuzzy wuzzies” towards a particular call and goes on that. No, like Paul, a
faithful minister of the Gospel considers his entire journey – how and where the LORD has been
leading him throughout his life. He considers the talents and gifts God has given him, as well as
his weaknesses. He considers what he has done and left undone. He considers the needs of the
people who are calling him as well as the needs of those he is currently serving. Most
importantly, he considers the message of Christ crucified that our world so desperately needs to
hear. Souls are dying throughout the world! Where can he best serve? Where does the LORD
want him to serve?
And, as he prayerfully considers these things, the Holy Spirit plants a conviction in his heart that
grows and grows until he knows the answer. And if that conviction is to “go”, then that is what
the LORD is leading him to do.
Now, understand that a faithful minister of the Gospel can’t just “decide” on a whim. The Holy
Spirit works when and where he chooses. This is why deliberating a call often takes time and
effort. This is why a minister needs the counsel and input of others – and lots of prayers. A
faithful minister of the Gospel doesn’t want to make a decision based on what is “good for him”.
He wants the LORD to lead him to do what is best for Christ’s kingdom. His heart goes out to
both places to which he holds calls – praying that the LORD will provide for both places equally
well. He prays for direction and conviction – not because he’s worried he’ll make the wrong
decision (there really is no “wrong” decision), but because he truly loves God’s people. As a
servant of the LORD, he simply wants to go where he can best serve God.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: I hope this sermon gave you some insight and understanding as to
what a “divine call” is and why a faithful minister of the Gospel might accept or return a new
call. The Spirit leads us where Jesus needs us. Sometimes he says “No.” Sometimes he says
“Go.” Whatever the LORD leads a minister of the Gospel to do, we can be sure the God will use
that decision for the good of his kingdom. We don’t have to worry about where we will serve or
who will serve us with the Gospel. Our dear Savior is in heaven, ruling over all things for the
benefit of his church – and that is the greatest comfort of all. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",5/1/2016,
"Having a dream career, family and home . . . many people live as if attaining these things is the
most important thing in life. “You only live once, so make the most of it.” Well, is that true?
Should our focus in life be trying to get all we can out of life?
The Bible answers that question by saying: Do not love the world or anything in the world. If
anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. . . The world and its desires pass away,
but the man who does the will of God lives forever.
i
Careers always come to an end. Houses need constant repair. Families grow old and separate.
All these things illustrate the truth: The world and its desires pass away.
So what is the most important thing in life? Our relationship with God through faith in Christ
Jesus. Why? Because, even though this world and everything it in will pass away, our relationship
with God will endure forever. Let us consider these things under the theme: Behold! He is
making everything new. 1) He is creating a new heaven and earth for us to enjoy. 2) He is
establishing a new relationship with us in love.
Part One: He is creating a new heaven and earth for us to enjoy.
Our sermon text is part of a glorious vision the apostle John saw while he was exiled on the Island
of Patmos. The Church was suffering severe persecution at that time. Christians were losing their
property, freedom and lives. They lived in worry and fear. They were tempted to wonder whether
or not God loved them.
In order to comfort and encourage these persecuted Christians, God gave John a grand vision of
the past, present and future – showing how Christ is in control of it all. Even though his followers
suffered much on this earth, Jesus would keep his promise to come again to deliver them. And
after judging the world, he would do something wonderful.
The apostle John writes: Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the
first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea.
Our current earth will not last forever. No, ever since the fall into sin, our world has been cursed
into a constant state of decay and corruption. And because of this curse, our earth will be destroyed
on the Last Day.
But out of its ashes, God promises to create a new earth and new heaven. What will the new earth
be like? It will be perfect in every way – just like our current world was before the fall into sin.
All the scary things that terrify people like earthquakes, tornadoes, storms and tsunamis . . . will
be absent. Everything will be perfect, beautiful and good. It will endure forever.
This new heaven and earth is the home Jesus spoke about, when he said: In my Father's house are
many rooms; if it were not so, I would have told you. I am going there to prepare a place for you.
And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also
may be where I am.""ii
 God wants us Christians to focus on our future home as we live our lives
on this earth. Why? Because Jesus suffered and died on the cross for our sins in order to purchase
us for this home. God wants us to live with him forever. He knows that if we don’t keep our
hearts and minds focused on this future home, the devil will lead us astray with all sorts of worries,
doubts and temptations.
Yes, Jesus is coming again soon, and when He comes, he will bring our new perfect home with
him. What a comfort this is for us Christians who see this world becoming more and more corrupt
and polluted with sin. Behold, Jesus is making everything new. He is creating a new heaven and
earth for us enjoy. He is establishing a new relationship with us in love.
Part Two: He is establishing a new relationship with us in love.
The only reason we will be allowed to enjoy this new heaven and new earth is because of the
relationship we share with God in Christ.
And what kind of relationship is that? One of supreme love and mercy. Even though we were born
with a corrupt, sinful nature that constantly rebelled against God, the LORD pitied us to such a
degree that He sent Jesus, his one and only Son, to suffer and die for our sins. Through holy
Baptism he has adopted us to be his own children – having worked faith in our hearts through the
Gospel. We belong to him and he belongs to us.
Sadly, our relationship with God will never be perfect this side of heaven: our love for Him will
always be tainted with sin. This is why we look forward to the other new thing Christ will do
when he returns: he will establish a new relationship with us in love. 
The apostle John writes: I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from
God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
In the Bible, Jerusalem is often symbolic for the Church. What is the Church? It is the total sum
of all believers in heaven and on earth. The Church is symbolized as Jerusalem because, just as
God made his presence known in the Jerusalem of Old Testament times, so also God makes his
presence known in the Church.
John saw the Church – the total sum of all believers – coming down from heaven to meet Christ.
They were raised from the dead and arrayed in glory - prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for
her husband. Scripture often calls the Church the bride of Christ. Why? Because of the love a
groom has for his bride – especially at his wedding. Jesus loves us with an even greater love. He
swore an oath to love us always. As a groom takes a bride to be with him for life, so Jesus will
take us to be with him forever.
We noticed that the Church is beautifully dressed for her husband. What is the Church wearing?
Nothing less than the righteousness Jesus won for her through his perfect life, innocent death and
glorious resurrection; as St. Paul once wrote: Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her
to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and
blameless.
iii

Holy and blameless from all sin – this is what we, wretched sinners that we were, are now through
faith in Christ Jesus. This truth will be revealed to be true on the Last Day when we will hear a
loud voice from God’s throne saying: ""Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with
them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. 4 He will wipe
every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old
order of things has passed away."" 5 He who was seated on the throne said, ""I am making
everything new!"" Then he said, ""Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."" 6 He
said to me: ""It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To him who is
thirsty I will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life.
What a beautiful message from God’s throne! From now on God will dwell with man. The saints
will have a relationship with God greater than Adam and Eve had with him before the fall. Never
again will man hide from God as Adam hid from him in the garden of Eden. Never again will
mankind be separated from God, going his own evil way. No, they will be his people and he will
be their God. Every tear will be wiped away. There will be no pain or anything that causes it.
There will be no death. The old cycle of life, death and decay that we are so used to in this present,
sin-cursed world, will have passed away. Everything will be different and filled with life.
Our minds cannot even begin to fathom what that will be like. We are so used to the temporality
of this earth. We long for eternity, but can’t comprehend it. When Christ comes on the Last Day
all our longings will be fulfilled, and we won’t have to imagine anything, because we will be living
it.
What a beautiful, wonderful home our God will give us on the Last Day. What an awesome
relationship we will have with Christ! No wonder Saint Paul could write: I consider that our
present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us.
iv
 Yes, this
teaching of our new eternal home is incredibly important for us to consider now - because in this
life we face many troubles and temptations. We are tempted to focus on the things of this earth.
We are tempted to be discontent with what the LORD blesses us with in this life. We are tempted
to despair in tribulation and stand in fear of all the evil that surrounds us.
Dear Christian, when the devil tempts you like this, remember St. Paul’s encouragement:
Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away, yet inwardly we are being
renewed day by day. For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory
that far outweighs them all. So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For
what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.v
Behold! God is making everything new. He is creating a new heaven and earth for us to enjoy.
He is establishing a new relationship with us in love. May these truths ever lead us to keep our
eyes fixed on Jesus - living to his glory as we await his return. Amen.

"My uncle raises sheep. Whenever he calls out over the pasture: “Here, lamby, lamby” the whole
flock comes running. Now why do you think that is? Is it because my uncle is some kind of
“sheep whisperer” whom all sheep love? No, because if he tried to call someone else’s sheep,
they wouldn’t come. The reason his sheep come to him when he calls is because they belong to
him and trust him.
Have any of you adopted a rescue animal as a pet? It can take a long time for such an animal to
grow to trust you. My brother has two dogs that he adopted from the humane society at around
the same time. One of the dogs loves him. The other dog is still scared of him and all men in
general. Why is that? We think it’s because she suffered abuse from some man in his past.
What can be said about pets can also be said about people and their relationship to Jesus. Those
who don’t know or belong to Jesus are naturally scared of him and refuse to come when he calls.
However, those who do know and belong to Jesus come running when he calls. They love him
because they know that they are loved by him. They find protection and peace in his arms. Let
us consider these things under the theme: I am Jesus’ Little Lamb. 1) I follow him because I
belong to Him. 2) No one can snatch me from His hand.
Part One: I follow him because I belong to Him.
Our sermon text took place during the Feast of Dedication – a Jewish winter holiday that we
know by the name “Hanukkah.” Jesus was walking in a covered open space of the temple
complex known as “Solomon’s Colonnade”. Believers would often gather there for instruction
and worship.
As Jesus was walking along, a group of Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long
will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
Who were these Jews? Were they believers who just needed Jesus to confirm what they already
suspected about him? Sadly, no. These Jews were people who didn’t trust him. They saw Jesus
as their enemy and wanted to make sure they understood his claims correctly so they could deal
with him appropriately.
Now think about it for a second: if Jesus were simply to answer their question “are you the
Christ” with a “Yup, you betcha,” do you think those Jews would have automatically believed in
him? No, absolutely not. Truth be told, they probably would have accused him of blasphemy
and tried to kill him on the spot. It’s easy for anyone to make claims about themselves. The
hard part is backing those claims up with evidence. Jesus knew that. This is why he almost
never claimed to be the Messiah. Rather, he let his teachings and works speak for themselves.
25 Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s
name bear witness about me . . .
The fact that the Jews even asked Jesus the question shows that the evidence was crystal clear.
His miracles, teaching and compassion – all of it fulfilled what Scripture prophesied about the
Messiah. The fact that these Jews could not find a single crime nor sin with which to charge him
should have given them pause.
“But,” Jesus continued, “you do not believe because you are not among my sheep.” The problem
was not a lack of evidence, but a lack of faith. Those Jews were sheep of a different shepherd:
the devil. They ate his lies and drank his flattery. Like mad dogs of a cruel master, they barked
at Jesus and wanted to attack him. They refused to be calmed by his gentle words and kind
actions. They didn’t belong to Jesus and therefore wouldn’t believe in him.
Sadly, like those Jews, many people in the world refuse to come to Jesus when he lovingly calls
out to them through the Gospel. Why is that? Because they belong to a different master. And
just as it is hard for an animal to change masters, so it is hard for a person to change gods. If a
person spent his whole life loving sinful pleasure, it will be hard for him to listen to Jesus who
calls him to forsake it. If a person grew up believing in Allah, it will be nearly impossible for
him to turn to Jesus as his LORD and Savior.
So does this mean all our mission efforts are useless? I mean, if people who don’t belong to
Jesus won’t follow him, what’s the point in spending all our money and effort in trying to reach
them? The answer to that question can be found in a statement Jesus made on another occasion:
“What is impossible with man is possible with God” (Luke 18:27 ESV). God’s Word is
powerful and active. It can and does do the impossible: it changes hearts. On top of this, Jesus
says that there are many “lost sheep” in the world – people who are wandering from master to
master – that actually belong to him. Just as a stray dog, after receiving a lot of love and patient
care, can become someone’s loyal pet, so also the lost people of this world can become Jesus’
sheep. 
But what about us? Do we belong to Jesus? Well, in answer to that question, let me ask you a
different one: Why did you come to worship this morning? Was it because you love Jesus and
want to learn more about him? If so, then rejoice because you belong to Christ.
Jesus says: 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. When Jesus calls us
to come to him, we come running. Why? Because Jesus knows us; and we know him. Like the
rest of humanity, we were once stray sheep - lost in the wilderness of this world. He saw that
we were in mortal danger and set out to defeat our enemy. Jesus laid down his life to win our
forgiveness. He rose again to show that we’ve been reconciled to God. After winning our
salvation, he then went out to search for his scattered sheep. Through the proclamation of his
Gospel, he called out to us, found us, and enticed us to follow him. For some of us this happened
at a very early age. For others it happened later in life. He healed our wounds that sin had
caused. He fed us with his Word and refreshed us with his Sacraments. Ever-loving Jesus won
our hearts. He adopted us as his own. We belong to him.
And so – just like sheep love being with their shepherd – we love being with Jesus. We run to
him when he calls. And as we stay close to his side, no one can snatch us from his hand.
Part Two: No one can snatch me from His hand.
27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 28 I give them eternal life, and
they will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. 29 My Father, who has given
them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. 30 I
and the Father are one.”
If there was any doubt as to who Jesus claimed to be, he dispelled it with the statement: “I and
the Father are one.” Jesus is the Son of God – our promised Savior from sin. He is our Good
Shepherd in whom we trust. With him at our side, we need not be afraid.
The wilderness that surrounded Jerusalem was a dangerous place for sheep. Wild animals were
on the prowl –looking for a sheep to devour. Thieves were constantly looking for ways to either
entice or force sheep to come with them. The land was harsh and sun hot. There were so many
dangers for the sheep, but when they remained close to their shepherd, they were safe.
Like the Judean wilderness, there are many dangers threatening our soul. The devil is constantly
on the prowl, looking for ways to devour us. The world is ever trying to entice us away from
following Jesus. And if enticement doesn’t work, then it shames Christians for their beliefs -
calling them unloving, hypocritical, bigoted and the like. And if shaming doesn’t work, then it
uses boycotts, lawsuits and, in some places on this globe, physical force to try to tear us away
from our Savior. Is it any wonder that a Psalmist once wrote: “For your sake we are killed all
the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.”? (Psalm 44:22 ESV)
What are we to do with some many dangers surrounding us? Do what any good sheep would do:
stay close to your Good Shepherd. Jesus knows the dangers that threaten us. He knows that we
can’t make it through life alone. This is why he not only leads us through life, he often carries 
us. “They will never perish,” Jesus says, “and no one will snatch them out of my hand.” Oh, the
devil and world will try, but as we stay close to Jesus they will all fail, for, as St Paul writes, “in
all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am sure that
neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,
nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love
of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Romans 8:37-39 ESV)
We belong to Jesus. No one can snatch us from his hand. Oh, what joy these truths give us.
Jesus is always watching over us. He gives us eternal life. Because of this I can be sure that the
Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. (2
Timothy 4:18 ESV) You can be absolutely sure of this too, as you remain close to Jesus.
Yes, the only real danger we are in is when we stray from Jesus and his Word. Just as a sheep
loses its protection when it runs away from its shepherd, so we lose our protection when we try
to sneak away from Jesus to pursue the foolish lusts of our hearts. That’s the only time we’re
really at risk. Worse than that, the more we wander away from our Shepherd, the more estranged
we become from him. An animal that continually stays away from its master shows it really
doesn’t want to belong to him. So we too, if we continually avoid Jesus and refuse to come
when he calls, show that we don’t really want to belong to Jesus. Another master has won our
heart – the same master that possesses the world: Satan himself. Sure, he might offer all sorts of
tasty treats to lead people away from Christ, but understand that he is just fattening his sheep up
for the slaughter. He is not a good master.
And so, dear brothers and sisters in Christ: do not delay when you hear your Good Shepherd call
to you. Run to Him. Listen to Him. Follow Him. Rejoice in the fact that, through faith, you are
Jesus’ little Lamb. He made you his own when he put his name on you at your Baptism. No one
can snatch you from his hand. Remain at his side, therefore, and he will guide you through the
valley of the shadow of death, and bring you safely home to himself in heaven. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",4/17/2016,
"Have you ever felt beyond forgiveness? I know that I've been tempted to feel that way and have
met many others who have as well. For example, I'll never forget talking to a young man sitting
in jail for hitting his infant son while high on drugs. I can't tell you how sorry he was - how much
he wished he could turn back time, but he couldn't. Or what about the soldier, who killed
civilians in the heat of battle. No matter what people told him to the contrary, he convinced
himself that his actions were beyond forgiveness.
Was it true? Were these two guys doomed to hell forever because they committed sins that went
beyond what God was willing to forgive? No, definitely not! With Peter as our example, let us
learn the height, breadth, and depth of Jesus’ love, under the theme: Fished out by Jesus 1)
From our sea of sin and sorrow, 2) For the privilege of saving others.
Part 1: From our sea of sin and sorrow
Our text takes place about two to three weeks after Jesus’ resurrection. Peter was with six other
disciples at the Sea of Tiberius (which is another name for the Sea of Galilee) in obedience to
what the angel told the women at Jesus’ empty tomb: “Go, tell [Jesus'] disciples and Peter, ‘He
is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.’ ” (Mark 16:7
NIV84)
Jesus singled out “Peter” as one who especially needed to come to Galilee. Why? Probably
because Peter felt especially guilty for his sin of denying Jesus!
If there was one thing Peter thought he was sure of, it was his devotion to Jesus. He professed to
loving Him more than anyone else: claiming that he would remain faithful even if all others fell
away. But then it happened: a simple servant-girl accused Peter of being a disciple and He
denied it. He didn’t just deny Jesus once, but three times - taking oaths and calling down curses
upon himself.
Wow, talk about betrayal? How could he continue being a disciple after that? How could Jesus
ever forgive him?
I can imagine that thoughts like these went through Peter’s mind as he waited to meet with Jesus.
Perhaps, this is why he simply blurted out: ""I'm going out to fish.” Yes, it seems as if, even back
then fishing was a way to get your mind off your problems.
“We’ll go with you.” the other disciples replied. So they went out and got into the boat, but that
night they caught nothing.
Early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not realize that it was Jesus.
He called out to them, ""Friends, haven't you any fish?"" ""No,"" they answered. He said, ""Throw
your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some."" When they did, they were unable to
haul the net in because of the large number of fish. Then the disciple whom Jesus loved said to
Peter, ""It is the Lord!""
When John told him that it was the Lord, I wonder if Peter thought about the first time Jesus
granted him a miraculous catch of fish after a night of not catching anything. On that occasion,
early in Jesus’ ministry, Peter also felt his guilt. Falling onto his knees he had said to Jesus: ""Go
away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!"" (Luke 5:8 NIV84). But Jesus didn't go away at that
time. No, instead he encouraged Peter with his love and forgiveness - telling him: ""Don't be
afraid; from now on you will catch men."" (Luke 5:10 NIV84) Would Jesus forgive him now as
He had back then?
""As soon as Simon Peter heard [John] say, ""It is the Lord,"" he wrapped his outer garment
around him (for he had taken it off) and jumped into the water. 
You can almost feel Peter’s excitement as you read this story. Memories of Christ's mercy and
love filled his mind as he swam with reckless abandon to meet Jesus.
8 The other disciples followed in the boat, towing the net full of fish, for they were not far from
shore, about a hundred yards. When they landed, they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish
on it, and some bread.
10 Jesus said to them, ""Bring some of the fish you have just caught.""
11
Simon Peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish, 153, but even
with so many the net was not torn.
We don’t know what Peter said or did with Jesus when He reached the shore. Scripture is silent.
One thing is certain, however, Peter was happy to see Jesus. When his master asked the disciples
to bring some freshly caught fish, Peter does more than that: he runs back to the boat and drags
to whole net of fish ashore!
12 Jesus said to them, ""Come and have breakfast."" None of the disciples dared ask him, ""Who are
you?"" They knew it was the Lord.
13 Jesus came, took the bread and gave it to them, and did the
same with the fish.
Jesus didn’t exclude Peter from the company of disciples. He was willing to sit and spend time
with him, and this gave Peter great joy.
This doesn’t mean that all was well with Peter. Based on what happened next, we know that
Jesus had to do some digging to both expose and dispose of the guilt that deeply rooted itself in
his heart. Still, being with Jesus gave him great comfort and hope. Jesus accepted him - sinner
that he was - and forgave him.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, when faced with overwhelming guilt over sin, our first instinct is
to run way from Jesus - thinking that there is no way he could forgive us because we don’t
deserve it. But the truth is this: there is no better place for us to be than with Jesus. He is
merciful in loving. His whole purpose in coming into this world was to forgive fallen mankind.
His resurrection proves that all sin has been paid for in full.
And so, just as Jesus called out to Peter, so Jesus calls out to us today. Through the Gospel he
invites us to come and eat at the feast of forgiveness he won for us through his sacrifice on the
cross. He is not ashamed of anyone who turns to him in genuine repentance and faith. He who
ate with tax collectors and sinners in the past is still willing to spend time with them – with us! –
today.
When drowning in a sea of sorrow and sin, don’t swim away from the Gospel net Jesus casts.
Swim to it and receive the same peace Peter received: full forgiveness and reconciliation to God.
Part Two: For the privilege of saving others
Even though Peter was happy to see Jesus, our Savor knew that guilt still lurked in his heart. In
one sense Peter was right: He did not deserve to be Christ’s representative on this earth. But the
truth is that no one does. It’s not our love and dedication for Christ that makes us Christians,
rather it’s His love and dedication to us! Jesus needed Peter to know this for two reasons: 1) so
that Peter would find peace and joy in his calling to be an apostle, and 2) so that Peter would not
rely on himself in his calling, but on Christ’s grace and mercy alone. This is why Jesus
confronted Peter with 3 questions.
Now, before we look at Jesus’ questions, there is something I should explain ahead of time: the
Greek language has 4 different words for love - two of which are used in our text. The Greek
word “agape” is translated as “truly love” in this account. It is a pure, self-sacrificing love. It is
the kind of love God has for us. The other word for love is “phileo,” which is a lesser
“friendship” kind of love that neighbors might have towards each other.
We read:
15 When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, ""Simon son of John, do
you truly love me more than these?"" In asking this question, Jesus reminded Peter of what he
said on the night of his betrayal. He was so confident of his love that he insinuated that it was
unmatched by any other disciple. Peter claimed that if even the rest fell away, he never would.
Did Peter actually have this kind of true love for Jesus? Peter knew his sin all to well. ""Yes,
Lord,"" he said, ""you know that I love you."" In other words, Peter is saying: “Lord, you know
the truth. My actions prove that I, in no way, can brag about my love. All I can say is that I love
you as a friend.”
Jesus accepted this answer and, in spite of Peter's imperfect love, reinstates him as an apostle.
Jesus said, ""Feed my lambs.""
16 Again Jesus said, ""Simon son of John, do you truly love me?"" Notice the difference in Jesus’
question: He is no longer asking if Peter loves him more than the rest of the disciples. He is
simply asking Peter if He truly loves him in a self-sacrificing kind of way. Peter answers the
same: ""Yes, Lord, you know that I love you” (this is, in a friendly way).
Jesus, again, accepts this response. He knows that no-one can love him as perfectly as he ought.
The only reason we love at all is because he first loved us. And so again, in spite of Peter’s
inadequacy, Jesus said, ""Take care of my sheep.""
The third time he said to him, ""Simon son of John, do you love me? - that is to say: do you love
me as a friend?” This is why Peter was hurt by this last question. He wanted to truly love Jesus
in the same way Jesus loved him, but He couldn’t. This is why Peter said, ""Lord, you know all
things; you know that I love you.” - that is to say: “Gracious Lord, throughout your ministry on
this earth you have experienced first hand what kind of love I have for you. How I wish I could
say that it is as pure and great as your love is for me. Sadly it isn’t. As you know, my love for
you is imperfect. It fails but it is, nevertheless, there - all in response to your great love for me.”
In spite of Peter’s imperfect love, Jesus reinstated him as an apostle. Jesus said, ""Feed my
sheep.”
As it happened with Peter, so it happens with us. Like Peter we love Jesus. We truly don’t want
to sin. And yet what happens all too often: we fall and some times our fall is hard! Could Jesus
ever love us again? Could he ever forgive us?
Yes He can. He calls us to himself - reminding us of his love. As we confess our sins, he
reassures us of our total forgiveness and peace we have through faith in him. Now it is certainly
true that he may probe our hearts with his law just like he did with Peter. Even though the
probing hurts, understand that he does it out of love. Just as a doctor wants to cut out any hint of
cancer so that it doesn’t come back, so also Jesus wants to cut out every hint of self-reliance
from our heart. He wants us to rejoice in his perfect love for us and not in our failing love for
him.
And after he cuts out that self-reliance with the scalpel of his law, he heals us with his promise of
complete forgiveness. He reinstates us as his royal priests and representatives on this earth -
called to declare his praise in the world.
And so, dear brothers and sisters in Christ, if you ever feel your sin is too great to be forgiven,
heed Christ’s call to come to him. He paid for your sin in full on the cross - and nothing can
change this fact. His resurrection proves it. Heed Christ’s call and confess your sin. He is
faithful, loving and just. He will forgive your sins, regardless of how horrible they are. Though
faith in his forgiveness you will become like Peter: a disciple of Jesus - fished out of a sea of sin
and sorrow for the privilege of saving others. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",4/10/2016,
"I had an uncle who was a Catholic missionary in Angola. One fall, when I was a child, I got to
talk to him on the phone. He promised to come and visit me in the spring. Hearing about his
visit gave me great joy.
Unfortunately, he had enemies and his enemies killed him just before Christmas. Death
prevented my uncle from keeping his promise. Death prevented me from having joy.
Jesus promised his followers many wonderful things: forgiveness of sins, freedom from their
enemies, eternal life with God, etc. . . These promises gave his followers great joy. But Jesus’
enemies killed him. Did all of Jesus’ promises die with him on the cross? No, actually the
opposite came true. You see, Jesus is not like my uncle or any other human on this earth. Death
could not prevent him from keeping his promises because death could not prevent him from
coming back to life.
With the Gospel of St. Matthew as our guide, let us rejoice, for Christ is risen! 1) He is risen to
show his enemies powerless. 2) He is risen to keep his promises. 3) He is risen to give his
followers joy.
Part One: He is risen to show his enemies powerless
As the light of the sun glowed on the horizon and the early birds started to sing on the morning
of that first Easter in Jerusalem, there was no indication that this Sunday was going to be any
different than any Sunday before it. There was, however, tension in the air.
Just two days earlier a man name Jesus was crucified for claiming to be the Messiah - the
promised King of the Jews. Many people held him in honor – considering him to be a great
prophet. His many miracles and powerful teaching led some people to wonder whether or not he
wasn’t the Savior the Scriptures foretold. But here’s the problem: his enemies killed him. “How
could this be?” his followers thought. “How could Jesus die if he truly was the Messiah? Didn’t
he promise that he was going to establish a new kind of Kingdom on this earth? How can he do
that from the grave?” And so all their hope seemed to die with Jesus on the cross.
What Jesus followers failed to realize was that, since the wages of sin is death, it was necessary
for the Savior to die in order to pay for their sins. But they couldn’t think about that. The image
of their dear friend and teacher, disfigured and suffering on the cross, was so etched in their
minds, that all they could focus on was their loss, and their hopelessness.
Jesus’ enemies, however, were ecstatic that they were finally rid of him. But they also
remembered something his followers had forgotten. Jesus said that he would rise on the third
day after he died. Now, Jesus’ enemies didn’t actually think Jesus would rise from the dead; that
would be impossible! They were, however, afraid of Jesus’ body being stolen. This is why, with
Pilate's permission, they sealed Jesus’ tomb and posted armed guards around it. They wanted to
make sure this dead man remained dead.
Little did Jesus’ enemies realize, however that Jesus was not a mere man. He was who he
claimed to be: the Messiah - the LORD incarnate! Even though the world, death and the devil
did their best to overcome Jesus, He showed his enemies powerless by rising from the grave.
Our text tells us that, as dawn was about to break, there was a violent earthquake. At the
moment this earthquake happened, an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, and going to
the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. Note that the angel didn’t come to let Jesus out of
the tomb, he came to show Jesus’ enemies that he was already gone. The tomb was empty!
Jesus had risen from the dead!
The angel’s appearance was like lightening, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards
were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. The guards fainted in fear.
When they came to, they fled at his sight. Try as they might, Jesus enemies could not keep him
in the grave.
Already in this short account, there is reason for us to rejoice: Jesus’ resurrection shows not only
that his earthly enemies are powerless, but also that our great spiritual enemies – sin, death and
the devil – are powerless as well.
Here’s how it works: the Bible says that the wages of sin is deathi
. Jesus, however, died as
someone who never sinned in payment for sin. Now, since Jesus payed for our sins, death could
not hold him. He rose from the dead, showing that sin had been paid for in full. 
Now, since sin has been paid for and death defeated, the devil lost the very tools he used for our
destruction. Without the ability to hang sin over our heads and threaten us with eternal death in
hell, he is powerless against us. We are now free! And we receive this freedom through faith in
Jesus for the forgiveness of sins.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: Jesus’ resurrection marks the beginning of a new era. The wall of
sin that separated us from God has been removed. We now can come before our God without
fear – trusting in his mercy and love to forgive our sins for Christ’s sake. Look at the proof: the
tomb is empty, and Jesus’ enemies run in fear. Rejoice! Jesus is risen to show his enemies
powerless.
Part Two: He is risen to fulfill his promises.
Shortly after the soldiers ran away in fear, the sun began to peek over the horizon. At that
moment some women were on their way to the tomb to pay their last respects to Jesus: the man
they loved and trusted as their Savior. They waited until Sunday, because Jewish law forbade
them to do any work on the Sabbath. How fearful it must have been for them to go to the tomb –
wondering whether or not Jesus’ enemies would be looking for opportunities to arrest his
followers. Yet, out of love and respect for their Savior, they boldly went – in spite of the danger.
We can’t help but wonder what was going through their minds. “Jesus, our dearest Jesus, is
dead! Why did he have to die? He was our greatest hope. He was so good both to us and all he
met. How could God allow this to happen to him? What will we do now?”
When the women reached the tomb, they were in complete shock! The tomb was open and
Jesus’ body was gone! As sorrow and confusion began to overwhelmed them, the angel, who
kept watch over the tomb, appeared to them and said, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are
looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see
the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples: ‘He has risen from the dead and
is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.”
Why were the women so sad, confused and afraid? Didn’t they remember prophecies like the
16th Psalm, in which Jesus said: “you will not abandon me to the grave, nor will you let your
Holy One see decay?”ii Didn’t they take to heart the many times Jesus prophesied, not only his
death, but also his resurrection on the third day?
But, shocked at Jesus death, they forgot all these promises. All they could focus on was their
sorrow and loss. Don’t misunderstand me: it wasn’t wrong for Jesus followers to be sad. Their
sin was allowing their sadness to turn into despair – thinking that all was lost, that Jesus wasn’t
really the Messiah.
The angel’s message dispelled their fears: “He is not here; he has risen, just as he said.” The
angel points to the empty tomb as proof of this fact. Jesus kept his promise. He wanted the
women to go back and tell the others what they had seen and heard.
Here is another reason for us to rejoice: Jesus has kept His promises. He promised to suffer and
die for our sins. He promised to defeat sin and death by rising from the grave. And Jesus has
kept his promises. All of our sins have been forgiven. His resurrection proves it.
There are many more things Jesus has promised in Scripture to do for us. For example, the Lord
promises to rescue believers from every evil attack and bring us safely to his heavenly
kingdom.
iii
 He promises to work in all things for the good of those who love him.iv
 He promises
to raise us from the dead just as he rose from the dead.
v
Jesus’ resurrection proves that he will keep all these promises, regardless of how fantastic and
unbelievable they may seem to our sinful human heart. Rejoice, therefore, because Jesus didn’t
just rise to show his enemies powerless. He also rose to keep his promises.
Part Three: He is risen to give us joy
After listening to the angel, the women ran from the tomb. At first they ran in fear, but soon that
fear was replaced with joy. “Could it be true? Is Jesus, our dear Savior, alive from the grave?
It seems too good to be true, but an angel himself has told us!” Thus they ran to tell the others
this wonderful news.
Suddenly Jesus met them, “Greetings,” he said. The word translated here as “greetings” literally
means, “rejoice.” It was a common Greek greeting in the ancient world, but Jesus brought new
meaning to it.
“Rejoice!” The reason for the women’s joy was right in front of them: Jesus himself, risen and
alive! Overcome with the emotion of being the in the presence of their Savior, they came to him,
clasped his feet and worshipped him.
“Do not be afraid,” Jesus said. He was risen, just as he promised. He most certainly was their
Messiah. The forgiveness and salvation he promised to them was real.
Jesus went on to say, “Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.” He calls
his disciples “brothers” and oh, what a term this is! Through faith in Christ we are adopted into
God’s family. God is our Father and Jesus our brother! What an awesome message of peace and
joy Jesus gave these women. How glad they were to tell His disciples.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: Jesus is risen to give us joy! Through faith in his resurrection we
are at peace with God. Through faith in Him we know that, when He comes again on the Last
Day, we will be raised to life and see him as he truly is. Death cannot separate us from him.
Death cannot separate believers from each other! Because He lives, we too shall live.
Therefore, brothers and sisters in Christ, rejoice: The Lord is risen! He is risen indeed! Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",3/27/2016,
"Why do you come to Communion? Is it merely because Christian tradition dictates it? Do you
think participating in the Lord’s Supper is a way you can dedicate yourself to God? Do you
come merely because everyone else does?
I hope these aren’t your reasons. Communion is neither an act of “dedication” nor a mere
tradition of the Church. It is not something we do for God. God’s word tells us that the Lord’s
Supper is a special meal in which Jesus offers us his very body and blood as a reminder of his
sacrifice for our forgiveness. Holy Communion unites us with both Jesus and each other in such
an intimate way, that we can’t even begin to comprehend it.
As we celebrate Jesus’ institution of the Lord’s Supper this evening, let us recall what we receive
in it, under the theme: The Lord prepares a special Supper. 1) It is a meal of remembrance. 2)
It is a promise of salvation.
Part One: It is a meal of remembrance.
Our sermon text begins with Jesus sending Peter and John into Jerusalem to make preparations to
celebrate the Passover. “What is the Passover,” you might wonder? Like the Lord’s Supper it
was a meal of remembrance. 
This evening’s Old Testament reading recounted how the LORD instituted the Passover meal.
He was about to deliver his people from slavery in a most dramatic way: by sending the angel of
death upon Egypt to strike down the first born of every man and animal. Only those who found
refuge under the blood of the Passover Lamb would be saved. This is why He commanded each
Israelite household to slaughter a perfect, year old lamb and paint its blood on the doorposts of
their houses. They were to prepare the Lamb in a special meal and eat it all before morning -
ready to leave Egypt at a moment’s notice.
All the Egyptians lost their firstborn that night. But the LORD passed over the houses of His
people that had the blood of the Lamb on them. The Lord didn’t want the Israelites to forget
their deliverance. This is why He commanded them to celebrate the Passover every year
throughout the ages.
Even though the Passover meal was meant as a remembrance of the past, God also intended it to
be a symbol of how he would deliver every believer from the threat of eternal death in the future.
It was a living picture of Jesus, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!
(John 1:29 NIV84). Just as the Passover Lamb was sacrificed for the deliverance of God’s
people, so Jesus was sacrificed for our deliverance. Just as the Israelites found refuge from the
angel of death under the blood of the Passover lamb, so we find refuge from eternal death
through faith in the blood Jesus shed for our forgiveness.
This is why, while celebrating the Passover on the eve of his crucifixion, Jesus instituted a new
memorial meal for all future generations, which we know as “The LORD’s Supper.” We read:
And he took bread, gave thanks and broke it, and gave it to them, saying, ""This is my body given
for you; do this in remembrance of me.""
The first thing we notice is that Jesus, when preparing this special meal of remembrance, took
bread and gave thanks. Even though the Scriptures do not record the words Jesus prayed, they
were, nevertheless, very important. By the power of His prayer Jesus turned a simple meal of
bread and wine into the Sacrament through which He offers believers the gift of his true body
and blood for the forgiveness of sins.
Then Jesus broke the bread and gave it to his disciples saying, “Take and eat, this is my body
given for you.” Notice that Jesus doesn’t say ""This symbolizes my body,"" or ""Think about my
body."" He says ""This is my body."" In with and under the bread Jesus broke was the very body
that, in a few hours, would be given into death for the sins of the world. Just as the Old
Testament Jews ate the Passover Lambs that were sacrificed to save them from death, so we eat
the Lamb of God, whose sacrifice saves us from eternal death in hell.
Because of how absolutely essential for our salvation Jesus’ sacrifice was going to be – He says,
“Do this (celebrate this meal) in remembrance of me.”
Jesus always wants us to remember his sacrifice for our salvation. Why? Because, through his
suffering and death on the cross, he forgave all our sins and delivered us from eternal death to 
eternal life. Jesus wants us to find refuge from God’s wrath in the blood he shed for our
forgiveness, and we can only find that refuge through faith in him.
The devil, however, doesn’t want us to remember Christ’s sacrifice for our sins. By filling our
minds with earthly worries and thoughts He tries to distract us from meditating on Christ’s
crucifixion. This is why Scripture encourages us to prepare for Holy Communion and not just
treat it as something we do. And how do we prepare for Communion? By confessing our utter
sinfulness to God and asking Him to forgive us for Christ’s sake. This is the heart of repentance.
Then God wants us to meditate on what we are actually receiving: not just bread and wine, but
Jesus’ very body and blood that was crucified and shed for our salvation. And as our thoughts
focus on his crucifixion, Jesus wants us to remember what he cried out from the cross: ""It is
finished."" All our sins have been paid in full. Proof of this is Jesus’ resurrection.
Just think: in Holy Communion, we aren’t merely receiving dead flesh and lifeless blood, but the
resurrected body and living blood of Jesus. When we receive the Lord’s Supper, we receive
Christ himself: our almighty God and Savior. We are covered in His blood and righteousness and
the threat of eternal death passes us by. Yes, the Lord has prepared for us a special meal. It is a
meal remembering the sacrifice Jesus made for our forgiveness. It is a meal that promises
salvation.
Part Two: It is a meal that promises salvation
Our sermon text continues: In the same way, after the supper he took the cup. After blessing the
wine as he did the bread, Jesus said. ""This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured
out for you.”
What does Jesus mean by new covenant, and how does it differ from the old one? A covenant is
basically a promise to do something and (in Old Testament times) was almost always established
through some sort of sacrifice involving blood.
The Old Covenant was the promise God made with the Israelites at Mount Sinai: that He would
be their God and protect them as long as they were careful to obey all of his commands. As you
can see, this old covenant was contingent on Israel’s ability to faithfully obey his law –
something neither they nor we are able to do.
This is why – already in Old Testament times – God promised to make a new, one-sided
covenant with his people. In this covenant The LORD would not ask or demand anything. He
would simply promise to be their God and forgive the sins of all who look to him in faith. The
Old Testament prophet Jeremiah foresaw this future new covenant when he wrote: ""The time is
coming,"" declares the LORD, ""when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and
with the house of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their forefathers when I
took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they broke my covenant, though I was
a husband to them,"" declares the LORD. ""This is the covenant I will make with the house of
Israel after that time,"" declares the LORD. ""I will put my law in their minds and write it on their 
hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will a man teach his neighbor,
or a man his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' because they will all know me, from the least of
them to the greatest,"" declares the LORD. ""For I will forgive their wickedness and will
remember their sins no more."" (Jeremiah 31:31-24 NIV84).
Since God’s law says that there can be no forgiveness without the shedding of blood, Jesus had
to shed his blood on the cross for God’s new covenant to be effective. And this is what Jesus did
– once and for all, for the forgiveness of our sins. The blood we receive in Holy Communion is a
token of both Jesus' sacrifice and God’s new covenant promise of our salvation. Through faith in
Christ we can approach the LORD in freedom and confidence – knowing that we are at peace
with him because his blood has atoned for our sins.
Dear Christian. Look at the special meal your Savior prepares for you. It is a meal of
remembrance. It is a promise of salvation. And in this promise, this covenant, we receive
Christ’s very body and very blood, the price paid for our salvation, proving beyond any doubt
that God has forgiven us. He will keep his promises to deliver us from this poor life of labor
unto himself in heaven. Rejoice, therefore, in the Supper the Lord prepares for us! It is a meal
of remembrance. It is a promise of salvation. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",3/24/2016,
"When I was 15, a friend of mine asked me to come to a political rally to see a man named
Helmut Kohl. Since I had just moved to Germany a few days earlier, I had no clue who he was
and why I should see him, but I went along anyway because my friend invited me. I saw a lot of
people carrying signs and cheering when he spoke. My friend told me that he was the prime
minister of Germany and was very influential in reunifying his country. Had my friend not
explained to me who this person was and what he accomplished, I probably would not have been
too terribly excited to see him.
Today we remember Jesus entering Jerusalem to the shouts and praises of his people. But who is
he that we should be excited to remember this event? As Christians, you and I know the answer.
However, there are hundreds of people in our little city, millions in our state and billions in our
world who don’t and won’t know who Jesus is unless someone explains it to them.
My friend was excited to tell me about Helmut Kohl because of the impact that man had on him
and his nation. May the LORD grant us even greater excitement and zeal to share the message
of his Son with our families, friends and neighbors. With the 24th
Psalm as our guide, let us
celebrate the person and work of Jesus, under the theme: Behold your God, Savior and King
Part One: Behold your God.
The first fact we should remember about Jesus is that He is God. Now it is important to define
what we mean when we say this because many people have a misconception of what a “god”
actually is. Some people think that a “god” is merely some sort of being with superhuman ability
or strength. Others view “god” more like a good luck charm than anything else. People define
and describe “god” in countless ways but none of them come close to being right. Only God
himself can reveal to us his true ability and nature; and he does it through the Bible.
2
Our Psalm says: The earth is the LORD'S, and all it contains, the world, and those who dwell in
it. 2
For He has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers. Our God is not only
powerful he is all-powerful: an observable fact when you look at his creation. For example, just
consider the raw power contained within our sun. Do you remember the nuclear bomb that was
detonated over Hiroshima to end the Second World War? Our sun releases the equivalent energy
of 1 trillion of those bombs every single second! Now consider that there are hundreds of
billions of stars like our sun throughout our galaxy, and countless galaxies throughout our
universe. Our God created all of this by simply saying “Let there be lights in the expanse of the
sky to separate the day from the night . . .”i

God not only created the universe, he also created us – and I am not just talking about the general
creation of man either. God personally created you, as the Scriptures say: “You created my
inmost being; you knit me together in my mother's womb.”ii
 We are, therefore, not our own.
We belong to him.
Our God is so large that He fills everythingiii and yet he knows and cares for each minute detail
of his creation. He knows and directs every atom in the universe for the glory of his name –
even counting and caring for every hair on our heads.
iv
 He knows our thoughts before we think
them.
v
 This is the Almighty God we worship, who has always existed and is the source of all
that is. This is why Christians get so excited when they remember Jesus riding into Jerusalem on
Palm Sunday: because He (that man on the donkey) is the true God!
vi
Let me ask you a question: how often do you think about Jesus being your almighty God?
Sometimes we think of him as powerful, but not necessarily all-powerful; as knowing, but not
necessarily all-knowing. Solomon was right when he said: “The fear of the LORD is the
beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.”vii
 Look at the love and
respect that Christ deserves from us and consider how little we actually give him. Sometimes we
act as if he can’t see us or think that he doesn’t have the power or concern to be involved in our
lives. We often treat Jesus as someone we can turn to when we are in trouble, but whom we also
can ignore when things are going fine - as if He is some good luck charm, or a rainy day
insurance policy. Brothers and sisters in Christ: let us repent of such thinking and worship Jesus
for who he truly is: our Almighty God who is involved in every little detail of our lives – even to
the point of directing every particle in this vast universe for our benefit. Offer Jesus true respect,
love, and honor, because He is the LORD.
Part Two: Behold your Savior
Our Psalm continues: 3 Who may ascend into the hill of the LORD? And who may stand in His
holy place? 4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to
falsehood and has not sworn deceitfully. 5 He shall receive a blessing from the LORD and
righteousness from the God of his salvation. 6
This is the generation of those who seek Him, who
seek Your face-- even Jacob.
3
The LORD is so completely holy that He cannot tolerate even the slightest inclination to evil in
his presence. Who can approach God? Only he who is completely perfect: who has never
sinned in deed, word or thought.
Now that leaves us in a pickle, doesn’t it? Are you perfect? I’m not. The Bible says that no one
is – except Jesus. So where does that leave us? At God’s mercy.
And praise be to God that He is merciful towards us. Even though every inclination of [man’s]
heart is evil from childhood,viii the LORD pitied us to such a degree that He took it upon himself
to save us from the eternal death we faced because of our sins. And how did He save us? By
taking on flesh and blood in the womb of the virgin Mary so that he could be human like us.
When Jesus walked this earth, he was tempted in every way, just as we are, but was without sin.
ix

And yet, even though He was sinless, he took the sins of all mankind upon himself to such a
degree that when God the Father saw Jesus on the cross He saw us. And God struck Jesus with
the full fury of his anger over sin. Jesus suffered and died – not for his sins (because he didn’t
have any) but for the sins of the whole world. He paid for them all. His resurrection proves it.
And because Jesus paid for all our sins in full, we can stand before God completely free,
righteous and holy. He offers this gift to all people through the proclamation of his Gospel so
that everyone who repents of his sins and trusts in Him might receive the gift of forgiveness, life
and salvation.
Yes, through faith in Jesus we all are the perfect man described by King David in this Psalm –
righteous and holy with not even the slightest hint of sin about us. This is who we are because
when God looks at believers, he sees his Son’s righteousness covering them. How do I know?
Because the Bible says: You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who
were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.
x
Think about what this means: Through faith in Jesus we are as righteous as the Son of God
himself, because his righteousness is our righteousness! This is yet another reason we celebrate
Jesus riding into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday: we know that He was riding into Jerusalem as our
Savior from sin, death and the power of the devil. He came to rescue us from the hell that
threatened us. He came to reconcile us with God.
Part Three: Behold your King
Now that we know exactly who Jesus is and what He has done, what shall we do with this
knowledge? The last part of our Psalm offers an excellent suggestion:
7
Lift up your heads, O gates, and be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come
in! 8 Who is the King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. 9
Lift
up your heads, O gates, and lift them up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in!
Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, He is the King of glory.
4
We can just picture the scene: a triumphant King returns to his castle while heralds call to the
gate keepers to let him in. Jesus’ triumphant entrance into Jerusalem certainly seems to fulfill
these words of Scripture, but there is yet another way they are fulfilled – even today.
The Bible calls believers the temple of the Holy Spirit. The gate that the Lord desires to enter is
the gate of our hearts. He wants to rule in our hearts so that by his grace we believe his holy
Word and lead a godly life now on earth and forever in heaven.xi
And so Jesus has his heralds call out to us – proclaiming the good news of who he is and what he
has done to save us. And just as Jesus, by the power of this word, created our universe and
raised the dead, so also, by the power of His Word, He makes our unwilling hearts willing to
open up to him through repentance and receive him in faith.
So, brothers and sisters in Christ, let us be heralds of this Gospel in the world – calling out to all:
“Lift up the gates of your hearts! Lift them up and let the King of glory in! “Who is the King of
glory?” you ask? Jesus is the King of Glory. He is the mighty LORD who has conquered sin,
death and the power of the devil for us. He is the Almighty God who created all. He is our
loving Savior who sacrificed himself on the cross to rescue us from hell.” Invite your family and
friends to come and worship Jesus this Easter - pointing to him and saying: Behold, here is your
God, Savior and King. Amen.

"Do you ever wish you were back in the good old days when life was simpler and better? It’s
human nature to think that way – especially when we are suffering the consequence of some sin
we made in the past. Oh, how we wish we could go back to change things. But we can’t.
“What’s going to happen now?” we wonder. “Did I just ruin the rest of my life?”
Remembering the past can be a good thing, but it can also be dangerous. How so? Because,
dwelling on the past may prevent us from perceiving the LORD’s present work in our lives. It
can also hinder the hope we have for the future by taking our eyes off of God’s promises.
Let us consider the proper way God wants us to view the past, present and future, under the
theme: Don’t you perceive what the LORD is doing? 1) Let the mighty deeds he performed
for others 2) direct your heart to the even mightier deeds He is accomplishing for you.
Part One: Let his mighty deeds he performed for others. . .
Our sermon text was originally written for the Jews exiled during the Babylonian captivity.
Remember how I said that rough times caused by some sin may make you long for the past?
Well, this is exactly how the Jews felt during their captivity in Babylon. One of them wrote: “By
the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion. (Psalm 137:1 NIV84)
Yes, Zion – the hill on which the temple once stood - was now covered with ruins. Their sins
caused that destruction. For decades God warned his people to repent of their idolatry and
selfishness. You see, the Jews wanted to be like their heathen neighbors who lived openly sinful
lives. Their gods didn’t have all these clean and unclean laws like the LORD had. Their laws
didn’t command a Sabbath rest. Their religions didn’t forbid sexual immorality. 
The selfish desire to be like the nations around them led the Jews to break the covenant they had
made with the LORD at Mt. Sinai. Even though God could have destroyed them for their sin, He
didn’t. Rather, he patiently sent prophet after prophet – calling them to repent. But they didn’t.
Therefore God made good on his threat, allowing Babylon to conquer them.
In that foreign country the Jews now sat, mourning over their sin and thinking back to the good
old days when they had a great relationship with the LORD: when He chose them be his special
people and miraculously delivered them to the land of Canaan. Those days are gone for good.
All they had were memories.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: have you ever felt the way the Jews did? Has God allowed some
hardship or consequence of sin to affect you to such a degree that you have almost given up
hope? When this happens, don’t despair; rather look to the LORD in genuine repentance and
faith. God’s word says: The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O
God, you will not despise. (Psalm 51:17 ESV) And in another place it says: ""Come, let us return
to the LORD; for he has torn us, that he may heal us; he has struck us down, and he will bind us
up.” (Hosea 6:1 ESV) That is what God promised to do for the Israelites, and this is also what
the LORD promises to do for us.
The Jews had come face to face with the reality of their sins, and were on the brink of despair
because of them. But listen to what the LORD says: 16 Thus says the LORD, who makes a way in
the sea, a path in the mighty waters, 17 who brings forth chariot and horse, army and warrior;
they lie down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick: 18 “Remember not
the former things, nor consider the things of old. 19 Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it
springs forth, do you not perceive it?
In other words God is basically saying: “Do you remember the Exodus, when I delivered your
forefathers from Egypt by performing that great miracle at the Red Sea – when they walked
through it on dry ground with walls of water on either side of them? Do you remember how I
incited Pharaoh, who had the most powerful army in the world, to pursue your fathers, only to
destroy that army so that they could never harass them again? I am the same God today as I was
then – possessing the same love for you as I had for them. Don’t, therefore, look at the past with
longing. Stop dwelling on the past and look and what I am doing now. Just as I saved them, so I
will save you; but I will do it with an even greater deliverance.”
Brothers and sisters in Christ: do you get the point God is making? The past serves as a
reminder of what God can do – how he faithfully loved and powerfully saved his people. Look
at that deliverance and remember that the God that so mightily saved his people back then is our
same God today. He has not changed. He will keep his promise to deliver us, just as he did for
Israel. Don’t dwell on the past, but keep your eye on the present as you hold on to God’s
promise for the future. Let the mighty deeds he performed for others direct your heart to the
even mightier deeds He is accomplishing for you.
Part Two: . . . direct your heart to the even mightier deeds He is accomplishing for you.
The LORD says: 19 Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?
I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert. 20 The wild beasts will honor me, the
jackals and the ostriches, for I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to
my chosen people, 21 the people whom I formed for myself that they might declare my praise.
There is a twofold fulfillment to this prophecy. On the one hand God is reassuring the Jews that
He will bring them from Babylon back home to the Promised Land of Canaan. He had their
rescue all planned out and, later on in Isaiah, even gives them the very name of the person who
would free them from their captivity: Cyrus the Persian.
If Israel would just cling to his promised redemption in faith, they would perceive God working
in all things to bring about this great deliverance. Not only that, but they would also perceive the
greater deliverance their restoration from Babylon would signify.
And this brings me to the second purpose of this prophecy: it describes the way God delivers all
believers from their slavery to sin and brings them home to himself in heaven.
“I will make a way in the wilderness,” the LORD says. I am certain that when we hear these
words, God wants us to think about a prophecy Isaiah recorded just three chapters earlier: A
voice cries: ""In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight in the desert a
highway for our God. (Isaiah 40:3 ESV) That is a clear prophecy about John the Baptist who
prepared the way for Jesus
God says, “I will make a way in the wilderness.” Jesus once said: ""I am the way, and the truth,
and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6 ESV) Yes, Jesus is our
only road to God – delivering us from sin death and the power of the devil. The LORD says in
our sermon text: I give water in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen
people. Jesus himself said: whoever drinks of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty
again. The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal
life."" (John 4:14 ESV)
As you can clearly see, our sermon text is all about Jesus, and the great deliverance from sin that
he would accomplish for us. He won forgiveness for all people through his perfect life, innocent
death and glorious resurrection. Everyone who looks to him in repentance and faith has eternal
life. Because Jesus accomplished this great salvation when he first walked this earth, all creation
eagerly looks forward to his coming again. Then it will be liberated from the curse of sin that
encompasses it. This is the greater deliverance God has planned for us – a far more miraculous
one than Israel experienced when it crossed the Red Sea.
When we see all the bad things that are happening in this world - Christians being physically
persecuted in some areas and many Christians falling away from the faith in others – we might
look to the past and long for what we considered the golden age of Christianity. Instead of
dwelling on the past, however, God wants us to look into his word. Don’t you perceive what the
LORD is doing? Jesus prophesied that all the bad things we are now experiencing would
happen. They are signs telling us that our redemption is drawing near.
Let us then learn to use our time wisely on this earth: not by lamenting because of how bad
things are getting, but by sharing the Gospel with whomever we can. God saved us for this
purpose, calling us “the people whom I formed for myself that they might declare my praise.”
Brothers and sisters in Christ: Is the guilt of some sin wearing on you that you don’t know how
you can go on? Turn to God in repentance and faith. He is the same merciful LORD who
forgave and delivered the Israelites; and he promises you use his almighty power to forgive and
rescue you as well. Don’t despair, but trust in his promise to work in all things for your eternal
good. Study the Scripture to remind yourselves of his promises, and then wait for their
fulfillment by using your time and energy to encourage others with the Gospel. This was God’s
will for his people held captive in Babylon as they awaited their restoration. This is God’s will
for us too as we wait for his 2nd coming, when he will deliver us home to the promised land of
heaven. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",3/13/2016,
"This heartbreaking scenario is becoming all too familiar: a young man or woman who grew up in
a Christian home and, perhaps, even attended Christian schools, becomes embittered against
God. Instead of seeing the Christian religion as a relationship with their loving LORD, they
view it as a set of arcane rules and stories preventing them from fulfilling their desires. And so
they leave – not only their congregation, but their former faith as well. They leave - embarking
on a quest to find happiness and fulfillment in what the world offers.
Why does this happen? Couldn’t anything be done to prevent it? What is God’s attitude towards
those who fall from faith? What should our attitude be towards them?
2
Let us listen to Jesus’ answer these questions in his famous story of the prodigal son, under the
theme: Our Forgiving Father. 1) He forgives the selfish. 2) He also forgives the selfrighteous.
Part One: He forgives the selfish.
There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my
share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them.
The younger son in this parable represents people who grow up in the Church, but instead of
focusing on the LORD’s love for them, they feel resentment towards God – much like a teen
might feel resentment towards his parents. Why? Because they hear their friends talk about
their freedom and how much fun they are having living on their own terms with no restrictions.
They want to have the same freedom, but God’s “rules” are preventing that. Yes, God has told
them time and time again that his commandments are for their good and protection, but their
worldly friends have convinced them that they're just being used - kept under the control of
religion. If there were a heavenly Father that loves them, wouldn’t he let them be free to do
whatever they want?
And so, like the younger son, they demand to be free. They want their “share” of the estate –
that is, all the earthly blessings to which they feel they are entitled.
Notice that the Father gives in to the younger son's demands. Why? I suppose he could've said
""No"" and forced the son to stay. But wouldn’t that have just furthered the son’s resentment
towards his father? In a similar way God knows that forcing Christians to remain in faith will
not get them to love him. This is why, with great sadness, he often allows those demanding to be
free to go and use - for their own earthly purposes - the time, talents and treasures he gave them.
Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and
there squandered his wealth in wild living.
The word translated as “wild” in our text literally means “unsaved”. In other words the younger
son was living as one who rejected salvation. This is often how those who leave the Church live:
spending all their time, talent and money on making life for themselves easy and enjoyable.
They do whatever they want, whenever they want.
After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to
be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his
fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no
one gave him anything.
When a person desires to live without the LORD, the LORD, after a time, may allow a person to
lose everything he holds dear. Why? Is it punishment? No, more often than not it is to give a 
3
person a glimpse of what life without Him is truly like: empty and hopeless. He does this in the
hope that they will come to their senses and repent.
But instead of repenting, God’s wayward children, more often than not, look to the world for
help – hoping that others will pity them and show them kindness. They soon realize, however,
that the help the world offers is not really help at all! Many people take advantage of those who
are in need. This, too, the LORD allows – revealing mankind’s selfishness and wickedness in
ways that can’t be ignored.
When he [the younger son] came to his senses, he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have
food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to
him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called
your son; make me like one of your hired men.
Praise God: the son in our text came to his senses. Experience taught him that the world is a
deceitful place. It promises love, happiness and help, but – in the end – it only disappoints.
Oh, how sad it is that many people come to this point, only to despair. And why? Because they
refuse to take the step this younger son took: they refuse to acknowledge that life in God’s house
is far superior than life in the world. In God’s house a heavenly Father watches over and cares
for even the least of his servants. Few truly care for others in the world, and when they do, it is
often as a means to serve their own ends.
This is why this Son is determined to return home and confess his sins to his father – trusting that
he would forgive him. What gave him this hope? Nothing that he had done - that’s for sure.
No, rather he remembers the love his father continually expressed to everyone in his household.
The hope of mercy moved him to come home.
What was true for this lost son, is true for every believer who has fallen from faith: the LORD’s
love is what ultimately brings a person back to God. When events in life have led a person to
acknowledge how hopelessly sinful they are, they don't need God’s law preached to them
anymore. They need to be reminded of God’s mercy, providence and love. They need to be
reminded of the Gospel.
So he got up and went to his father. ""But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and
was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed
him.
What love God the Father has for his lost children! He loves them so much that he sent Jesus to
pay for the sins of every person on this earth – regardless of whether or not they repent. He
loves his lost children so much that he actively looks for their return – working in all things to
bring them back to faith. And when they, realizing their sin, turn to him for mercy? He runs to
meet them – embracing them with his love.
""The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer
worthy to be called your son.' ""But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe 
4
and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and
kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine was dead and is alive again; he was
lost and is found.'
God is not like us, who feel that we have to test and probe when people say they're sorry. He
accepts our repentance even before we speak it – forgiving us for Christ’s sake. Right after we
repent, God clothes us with a robe of Christ’s righteousness. He welcomes us back as his sons –
giving us greater honor than we deserve. He calls all heaven to rejoice with him because He is so
happy to have us back.
This is the forgiving love God the Father has towards his selfish children who run away from
him to pursue the world. He patiently waits for them to come to their senses – working in
everything they experience towards that end. Everything he allows in their life, he allows in
love. And when they do turn back to him in repentance, he willingly forgives everything – no
questions asked. So great is the Father’s forgiving love – not only towards the selfish, but – as
we will see next - also towards the self-righteous.
Part Two: He forgives the self-righteous son.
Not everyone was happy with the younger son’s return. We read: ""Meanwhile, the older son
was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of
the servants and asked him what was going on. 'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your
father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.' ""The older brother
became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he
answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your
orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when
this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home, you kill the
fattened calf for him!'
The older son represents self-righteous “Christians”. They may be life-long, active members of a
congregation – working hard to serve God - but herein lies the problem: they do not serve God
out of love, but out of obligation. They come to church because they feel they have to come to
church. They try their best to keep God’s law because they feel they have to keep his law.
Secretly, however, they desire to be free – to enjoy the pleasures of the world – but fear keeps
them from doing so. When they see a very sinful person repent, they think it is unfair that God
should forgive them without any further requirement. “They got to do what they wanted, but we
didn't. Why should God accept them back as if nothing ever happened?”
How often aren't we like this older brother, secretly desiring the things of this world and
begrudging those who get to experience them? But the truth us that we don't know how good we
have it. The younger brother learned from experience that a sinful life is no life to be desired.
Why not? Because it is a life absent of God’s presence and love.
""'My son,' the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. 
5
So greatly God has honored us that we can ask Him for anything in his name and He promises to
give us what we ask for – all in accordance with his good and gracious will. As sons in God’s
house, He is always with us – protecting us and providing all we need. We are not slaves, but
sons – all according to his mercy and grace.
Yes, sometimes we need a kick in the pants to remind us how good we have it in the Church:
blessings of forgiveness, peace, love and eternal life through faith in Christ. Notice the father
lovingly calls the older son to realize these great blessings. He does this because he sees that the
self-righteous son is in danger of resenting him – just like the younger son did earlier in life.
This is why he lovingly calls him to repent: to see that the life the younger son lived was really
no life at all. This brother of yours was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'""
Dear brothers and sisters, each one of us knows someone who has fallen from faith and is
embittered towards religion. What should our attitude be towards such a person? Don’t envy or
begrudge them; rather love them. Earnestly pray for them. Share the Gospel with them
whenever you can – reminding them of the great blessings we have as children in God’s house.
God will use your witness to call them back home. Understand the forgiving love God has for
both the selfish and the self-righteous. Rejoice in this love yourself, and share it with all of
God’s lost children. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",3/6/2016,
"Our names are incredibly important. Our entire reputation is bound up in them. For example, if
I mention the name “Aaron Rodgers” most of you will immediately think about the Packer’s
quarterback, all you know about him and whether or not you like him.
But there is also another way names can tell you about someone. Sometimes their very meaning
gives us insight into who a person is. For example, consider the name “Abraham” (which means
“Father of a multitude”) or Jesus (which means “the Lord’s Savior.”) The meaning of both these
names perfectly describe the men who bore them.
Names are important and often tell a story: if this is true regarding human names, how much
truer is it regarding God’s personal name: the LORD. Let us learn not only what this name
means, but the awesome comfort His reputation offers us, under the theme: The LORD is . . .
Our merciful God and eternal Savior.
Part One: Our merciful God
Our sermon text finds 80 year-old Moses tending the flocks of his father-in-law Jethro in the
rugged desert region of Sinai. It had been 40 years since Moses fled Egypt. Back there he was a
prince – the adopted Hebrew son of Pharaoh’s daughter. He grew up seeing the oppression of
his people until, one day, he decided to do something about it. He killed an Egyptian to protect a
fellow Israelite. When his crime became found out he fled Egypt and had lived in exile ever
since – wondering when God would fulfill the promise He had made to his forefathers
concerning the Promised Land. Many had given up on that hope.
When Moses led his father-in-law’s flocks to Horeb – a mountain on the far side of the Sinai
desert - there the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush.
Who is the “angel” that appeared to Moses? The core meaning of that word is “messenger” and
does not always refer to the spiritual beings we imagine when we hear it. The angel of the
LORD in our sermon text is God’s special messenger who knows the LORD completely and
reveals him fully. And who can do that? Only Jesus, the very Son of God, who himself said: “no
one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.""
(Luke 10:22 NIV84) What we have before us, therefore, is not the account of a mere angel
appearing to Moses, but of Jesus himself.
Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up. 3
So Moses thought, “I will go
over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.” 4 When the LORD saw that he
had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses! Moses!” And Moses
said, “Here I am.” 5 “Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place
where you are standing is holy ground.” 6 Then he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, because he was
afraid to look at God.
The first thing Jesus revealed to Moses about himself is that He is completely holy. No sinful
human can stand in his presence. This is why Moses was afraid to look at God.
The LORD deserves – yes, even demands our uttermost fear and respect. But, do we always
show it? How do we approach him in prayer? In humility and repentance - understanding that
we deserve nothing from him because of our sins? Or do we treat him as if he is some sort of
magic genie in a bottle: imagining that he has to answer our every wish and desire?
The LORD is not our personal genie. He is the eternal, almighty, all holy God who – centuries
before Moses was born - made specific promises to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob: namely, that he
would watch over their descendants, allowing them to grow in number and inherit the land of
Canaan. He never forgot that promise. Whatever promise God makes, He keeps.
7 The LORD said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying
out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering. 8
So I have come
down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a
good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, 
Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites. 9 And now the cry of the Israelites has
reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them. 10 So now, go. I am
sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”
God is not oblivious to the suffering of his people. He saw the brutality done to them by their
oppressors. He heard every single one of their cries for help. He knew their sorrow. For reasons
that only God knows, He delayed in rescuing them – waiting for the right time to come.
Now was that time! He would save his people and deliver them to the land he promised to
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He himself would do this, and Moses would be His chosen
instrument to accomplish it.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: do not gloss over this section of Scripture, thinking it has nothing
to say to you. See that the LORD is revealing himself as our merciful God, who sees, hears and
knows all. Yes, the LORD sees all your suffering and tears of sorrow on this sin cursed earth.
The LORD hears all your cries to him for help. I know that days, weeks, even years may pass
with no answer, but this does not mean that He has not heard you. He has and promises to work
in all things for the benefit of those who love him. Only be patient and wait for his deliverance.
His delay is not because He doesn’t care, but it’s for reasons that we can’t even begin to
understand. Patiently put your hope in God. He will not disappoint you, but keep his promise to
deliver you at just the right time – just like he did for the Israelites
11 But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of
Egypt?” 12 And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who
have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this
mountain.”
Can you imagine being commanded to tell the most powerful ruler of the world to let God’s
people go? No wonder Moses was afraid! But here is the thing: the LORD is not a God who asks
someone to do something impossible and leaves them alone to do it. No, our LORD is an ever
present God – standing beside his believers, equipping, training and upholding them all for the
task he has given them to do. We believers are mere tools in the hands of God. He is the one
working through us, accomplishing everything he desires.
What a comfort this is! I can’t tell you how many times I have prayed: “LORD, I don’t know
what to do. Please stay with me and work what you desire through me!” And I could say that
prayer in all confidence that God would do what I asked. How so? Because, just as He
promised Moses, so has Jesus promised us: surely I am with you always, to the very end of the
age. (Mat 28:20 NIV84)
Part Two: Our Eternal Savior
13 Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers
has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” 14 God 
said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me
to you.’ “
Wow, what a verse! In it God reveals his personal name – and boy, does it ever tell a story.
“Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh. God’s name is: I am who I am. He is not some impersonal force like the
Buddhists worship. He is an “I” – that is a personal being. He is “am” – that is “being” or
“existence” personified. His name tells us that he is eternal - that he is not subject to time or
space. His name tells us that everything that exists, exists because of him. His name tells us that
he is perfectly free – subject to no one and no rules. “I am who I am” – that is the LORD’s
name, and it is with this name that He reaches out to us as our Savior, as the next verse indicates:
15 God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever,
the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.
I want to talk to you about the name LORD as it appears in all capital letters. This Hebrew word
does not actually mean “lord,” in the sense we commonly understand it. You see, at some point
in Israel’s history, the people became so concerned with misusing God’s real name that they said
“Adonai” (which means “lord” or “master”) whenever they came across God’s name. But this is
not the actual meaning of God’s name (hence the reason it is spelled in all capitals). No his
name actually means: HE IS!
This name (LORD in all caps) is the most common name for God in the Bible – used slightly
more than 6000 times in the Old Testament. And when it is used, it is most often in the context
of his saving love toward his people.
Now, there is another name I need to bring into the mix. Earlier on I mentioned that Jesus was
the one talking to Moses. Do you know why I said that? Because our Gospel lesson recorded
Jesus saying: ""before Abraham was born, I am!"" (Joh 8:58 NIV84)
Jesus is the LORD, our merciful God and eternal Savior. He, together with the Father and Holy
Spirit, is the one who created all and for whom everything exists. When mankind fell into sin
and became enslaved to the devil, he did not give up on us but, in love, decided to save us. He
came to us in the person of Christ to suffer and die for our sins so that we could live with him
forever in heaven.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: names are important. They tell a story. What does God’s name
“LORD” reveal to us? That Jesus is our merciful God and eternal Savior. Hold on to this truth
and take comfort in this fact whenever you feel the pain, sorrow and guilt which are all a result
of living on this sin cursed earth. The LORD hears your cries and will deliver you at the
appointed time – just as he did for the Israelites during the time of Moses. How can we be sure?
Jesus' life, death and resurrection for us prove this beyond any shadow of a doubt. ""Don't be
afraid; just believe"" (Mar 5:36 NIV84) and you will see the LORD fulfill his promises, just as
His name proclaims. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",2/28/2016,
"Back in my former parish in Milwaukee, I had the privilege of serving Hope Carter - a fine
Christian lady who faithfully came to worship and Bible Class.
One of Hope’s sons served in the Army during the Vietnam war. He came back an emotional
mess – suffering from severe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. He drank heavily and got
involved with drugs. Hope truly loved her son and tried everything to get him into rehab. She
let him live with her - doing all his cooking and cleaning. But when he continued bringing drugs
into her house, she practiced tough love in the hope of getting him to change. She threw him out
of the house – letting him live homeless on the streets of inner-city Milwaukee. When he gave
signs that he was willing to change, she would invite him back home. But when he kept on using
those drugs and refused rehab, she kicked him out again in love; praying that he would see the
mess he was making out of his life and go to rehab to get the help he needed.
I never met this particular son, but Hope often talked to me about him, especially after she was
diagnosed with cancer. In the weeks before she died, her love turned into continual weeping. If
tears could have saved a person, her son would have definitely been saved. She wanted to see
him. She wanted to warn him. She wanted him to be safe. Her daughter got ahold of him, but
he refused to come and visit. Why? I don’t know. Maybe he was ashamed of himself and his
life. He did agree to talk to Hope on the phone one last time before she died, but that was it.
Hope’s other children wondered why their mother loved this son so much. They had some
choice names for him – especially when he didn’t even bother to come to Hope’s funeral! Why
did their mom cry so much for their no good brother when all he did was disappoint and reject
her?
If you’re a parent, I think you know the answer to that question. Hope was his Mom – no sin or
rejection would ever keep her from loving him unconditionally. 
Brothers and sisters in Christ: if you can understand the love Hope had for her wayward son,
then you are well on the way to understanding our sermon text and the emotion Jesus expresses
in it. Let us consider these things under the theme: Jesus cries over his people. 1) He cries
because they reject him. 2) He cries because he loves them.
Part One: He cries because they reject him.
Our sermon text took place while Jesus was preaching in Perea – a region ruled by King Herod.
Someone asked Jesus the question: ""Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?"" (Luke
13:23, NIV84) Jesus’ reply indicated that, even though heaven is open to all, many people will
not get in. Why is that? It’s not because God doesn’t truly desire their salvation. Rather, it’s
because many refuse to make every effort go through the narrow door of “Jesus” - that is to say,
they refuse to study and believe the Gospel.
31 At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said to him, ""Leave this place and go
somewhere else. Herod wants to kill you."" Why were these Pharisees trying to help Jesus? Were
they “good” Pharisees, like Nicodemus, who secretly followed him and were genuinely
concerned about his well-being? Or were they your run of the mill “bad” Pharisees who tried to
use “fear” to get Jesus out of their town? We don’t know the answer to that question. All we
have is Jesus answer: ""Go tell that fox, 'I will drive out demons and heal people today and
tomorrow, and on the third day I will reach my goal.'
Yes, nothing was going to keep Jesus from accomplishing his goal. And what goal was that?
Our salvation, which he would win by means of his perfect life, innocent death and glorious
resurrection. This is what Jesus alludes to when he says: I must keep going today and tomorrow
and the next day-- for surely no prophet can die outside Jerusalem!
Jerusalem was the LORD’s chosen city in which his temple stood. It’s very name means
“foundation of peace.” How Jesus loved this city - wishing that its inhabitants would turn to him
in faith – willing to fear, love and trust in him as their Savior.
This is why Jesus lamented over Jerusalem like Hope Carter cried for her lost son: ""O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to
gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not
willing!
History is filled with examples of how the inhabitants of Jerusalem decided that following the
LORD was not as much fun as following the gods of other nations. Whenever this would
happen, the LORD would send prophets to warn them of their sin. But would they listen? No,
they tried to kill the prophets instead. Why? Because they didn’t want to be told that they were
wrong. They wanted to worship God on their own terms, with their own rules and definitions as
to who he is and what he desires.
This is why Jesus laments over Jerusalem. He, the Son of God, had come to save his people
from their sins. But he was not the type of Messiah they wanted; so they rejected him.
And what would be the result of this continued rejection? Jesus says: 5
Look, your house is left to
you desolate.
By disregarding Jesus, the inhabitants of Jerusalem rejected their true protection and peace.
Instead of being objects of God’s great love and mercy, they became objects of God’s wrath and
punishment. The whole city and its temple would be destroyed - an event that took place in 69
A.D. Jesus lamented over Jerusalem because he foresaw this destruction.
“But,” some of you might be thinking, “what does this have to do with us? We aren’t the Jews
of Jerusalem. We are Christians who believe in Christ.”
This may be true, but watch out lest you fall. Understand that the same sinful desires that
tempted the inhabitants of Jerusalem away from their LORD also tempt us: things like money,
sex, leisure, and human pride. Our sinful natures want what the world has and all too often we
find ourselves pursuing it. We try to justify our sins by convincing ourselves that they aren’t
really that big of a deal. Whole church bodies attempt to redefine what sin is – accepting beliefs
and practices that clearly go against Scripture. And when they do this, they become exactly like
the inhabitants of earthly Jerusalem: refusing to accept Jesus on his own terms - wanting to be
more like the world around them instead.
And when this happens, Jesus laments. He laments over his lost children: that they do not listen
to him and his accept call to repentance. He laments that his grace is being twisted into a license
to do every sin imaginable under the sun. Yes, Jesus laments, because he knows the destruction
that is coming on the last day and sees his lost children running headlong into it.
Seeing Hope crying over her lost son caused her other children to consider their relationship with
their mother. Seeing Jesus lament over Jerusalem should cause us to do the same - leading us
to see the seriousness of sin and unbelief. His tears should lead us to pray: “Lord, forgive me
for the times I have treated you and your grace with contempt – unwilling to acknowledge the
seriousness of my sins. Lord, let the thought of your tears over Jerusalem remind me that you
truly love all people. You truly want the straying to turn back to you. You truly want the
unbelieving to know you, repent and be saved. Keep me from ever reading your Gospel with
complacency. Always remind me of your loving salvation so that, if I find myself on a path that
leads away from you, I might realize it, repent and turn back to you for forgiveness and life.”
Part Two: Jesus cries because he loves them
Why does Jesus weep over Jerusalem, a city that rejected him time and time again? For the same
reason he weeps over us when we stray from him or fall from grace: because he loves us more
dearly than any mother could ever love her children. Jesus was going to Jerusalem to win eternal
peace for all people. He was going to pay the most precious price possible to save mankind: his
life. The Bible says: 9
This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son
into the world that we might live through him. 10 This is love: not that we loved God, but that he
loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. (1Jo 4:9-10 NIV84)
Every warning Jesus gave, every miracle Jesus performed, every encouraging and gracious word
he spoke, was done out of love.
How beautiful it is to see Jesus lament over Jerusalem, because it is his love that moves him to
cry. Actually his love moved him to do more than cry, it moved him to die.
Blessed is the person Jesus loves. And whom does he love? You. All of you, every person in
this church, every person in this city, every person on this earth.
Jesus’ whole life was for you. He came to reconcile you with God: forgiving every one of your
sins. How did He do this? By living the perfect life you did not, and by taking your sins upon
himself and dying in your place. You were on Jesus’ mind as he suffered the agonies of hell on
the cross. Love for you is what moved him to die. Love for you is why he rose again. Love for
you is why he sent out missionaries, pastors and other Christians armed with the Gospel so that
you might hear the good news, repent of your sins, and be brought to faith.
Love is what caused Jesus to cry.
Hope Carter had one lost son, and she wept for him greatly. Jesus has many, many lost sons and
daughters. He weeps over them because they don’t believe in him and are heading to
destruction. He weeps over them in love – desiring that they come back to him before it’s too
late.
Just as Hope wanted her other children to love their lost brother as much as she did, so Jesus
desires the same for us. He wants us to weep for the lost too, doing all we can to reach out to
them with the message of his grace. May the LORD instill in all of us such a desire for our lost
sisters and brothers – that we become God’s voice to them, lovingly call them to come home to
Christ before it’s too late.. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",2/21/2016,
"Water is a powerful thing. It doesn’t take all that big of a wave to knock a man down and drag
him away. The same can also be said of temptation. We all have experienced it, haven’t we:
temptation so strong that it felt like we were being hit by a tsumani – overwhelming and
dragging us away, leaving us to drown in our sin and guilt? How can we stand up against such a
powerful force?
The answer to that question is found in our sermon text for today. Let us consider what it is,
under the theme: “It is written.” 1) This is the answer Jesus gave the devil to win our
righteousness. 2) This is the answer we give the devil to live in that righteousness.
Part One: The answer Jesus gave to win our righteousness.
Our sermon text takes place immediately after Jesus' baptism, when the Holy Spirit descended on
him like a dove, and a voice from heaven said: ""You are my Son, whom I love; with you I am well
pleased."" (Luke 3:22 NIV84).
Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit in the desert, 2
where for forty days he was tempted by the devil. 
Just as a wartime soldier doesn’t have the luxury of wasting time after receiving his orders,
neither did Jesus after his baptism. The Holy Spirit immediately compelled him to go into the
desert in order to do battle with the devil.
And in what form did this battle take place? The form of continuous temptation. I know: we see
only three examples in our text. But make no mistake: Jesus was constantly tempted – just as we
are. He had to be in order to win our righteousness.
And this leads me to answer a question some of you might be wondering about: “What exactly is
“righteousness?” Simply put, it is the state of “being right” - having no wrong in us at all. To be
righteous is to be pure, sinless and holy.
None of us are righteous in and of ourselves. We constantly break God’s commandments and
sin. And, because the Bible says that God will only accept the righteous into his kingdom, we
are hopelessly lost.
But God didn’t want us lost forever in hell. This is why He sent His Son to win for us the
righteousness we could never attain on our own. Jesus had to be tempted in every way – just as
we are. In order to be righteous, he also had to perfectly master each temptation: that is, be
completely free from sin in thought, word and deed.
Just as a mother may work hard at knitting a precious sweater to give to her daughter, so Jesus
labor was for us – to clothe us with his precious righteousness by faith. With his righteousness
covering us, we no longer offend God with our spiritual nakedness. When the LORD sees a
believer, he sees his Son, and welcomes that person into his kingdom.
The account of Jesus in the wilderness is the account of him winning our righteousness. And, as
we will see, he did it all with the one little Greek word which, translated into English is: “It is
written.”
Our sermon text continues: [Jesus] ate nothing during those [40] days, and at the end of them he
was hungry. 3
The devil said to him, ""If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.""
We all know that hunger can drive a man wild. I don’t think any of us can begin to imagine how
Jesus felt after 40 days of it! The devil tried using Jesus’ suffering and want to get him to doubt
His Father’s will. He was in effect saying: “Come on Jesus, prove that you’re the “beloved Son”
of God. Feed yourself. Why should you hunger – waiting on “God” to feed you.”
But for Jesus to “prove” himself to be the Son of God would be a sin. How so? It would show
both a lack of faith in the declaration God made at his baptism and a lack of faith in the LORD to
provide for his bodily needs.
Strengthened by the promises of the Scriptures, 4
Jesus answered, ""It is written: 'Man does not
live on bread alone.' ""
The Bible clearly promises that God watches over his own. He is the one who keeps us alive and
gives us every good thing. Even though outward experience was telling him to give up his faith,
Jesus held firm to God’s promise recorded in Scripture, and for this reason Satan had to find a
new tactic.
So the devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the
world. 6
And he said to him, ""I will give you all their authority and splendor, for it has been
given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. 7
So if you worship me, it will all be yours.""
Oh, who of us wouldn’t have fallen for this temptation! The desire for wealth, power, prestige –
isn’t this the power behind the world’s economy? So many have sold their soul for this lie of the
devil – trading in their faith in Christ for the pleasures and glories of this world.
Jesus answered, ""It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.' "" The Bible is
clear: everything belongs to the LORD - including our worship and praise. Bowing down to the
devil would mean denying God. Notice that Jesus does not debate the devil, arguing that he is
lying and could not possibly have authority over everything. He simply quotes God’s Word and
puts his faith in it – causing Satan to resort to some other tactic.
9
The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. ""If you
are the Son of God,"" he said, ""throw yourself down from here. 10 For it is written: "" 'He will
command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully; 11 they will lift you up in their
hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.' ""
Take special note of this temptation because it is an especially dangerous one. The devil placed
a tricky “either — or” dilemma in front of Jesus and even quoted Scripture to back it up. If Jesus
doesn’t jump, it looks like he doesn’t really believe God’s promise. If he does jump, then Jesus
would be falling into false belief – trusting in something God did not promise. Sure, on the basis
of how the devil uses the Scriptures, it seems as if God promised to protect Jesus if he jumped.
The problem is that the devil took that promise out of its proper context – making the Bible say
something God hasn’t promised.
Jesus' faith is in God’s pure Word and not a twisted version of it. He overcomes this temptation
by quoting a simple passage in context. This is what Bible really says: 'Do not put the Lord your
God to the test.' ""
When the devil had finished all this tempting, he left him until an opportune time.
“It is written.” With this answer Jesus overcame the devil’s temptations to sin – not just in the
wilderness, but throughout his earthly life. Jesus remained righteous by trusting God’s Word.
And because Jesus is righteous, so are we. How so? Because God offers Jesus' perfect record of
never sinning as a free gift to everyone who believes in him. God’s Word promises it, dear
Christian; believe it and receive it!
And when we, through repentance and faith, have this righteousness applied to us, we also stand
victorious over the devil. The flood of Satan’s temptations can’t drown us. Why not? Because 
we find ourselves standing on the mountain of Christ where those waters can’t reach. With Jesus
we can say: “It is written,” and live in the righteousness God freely gives us.
Part Two: The answer we give to live in that righteousness.
As the devil tempted Jesus, so he continues to tempt us, trying to use every trick he can to
remove us from Christ so that we drown in his flood of sin and guilt
For example, when we are struggling to make ends meet, the devil will come with temptations
like: “It’s more important to feed and clothe your family than go to worship. Take that better
paying job, even if it keeps you from church. Why suffer needlessly?”
When this happens, say with a firm conviction in God’s Word: ""It is written: 'Man does not live
on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.' "" (Mat 4:4 NIV84) And
then, having said those words, believe what they say – fully convinced that God will keep his
promise.
Or if the devil tempts you to lust after the things of this world, like money, wealth, entertainment
and power – promising that you will have a more fulfilled life if you pursue these things for
yourself rather than pursuing the LORD – then remind both the devil and your sinful flesh: ""It is
written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only.' ""
Then again, if the devil comes at you with Scripture – twisting its meaning in order to get you to
believe that God is okay with you doing things that are otherwise against his Word – quote the
clear passages of Scripture that speak the truth. Why? Because the devil can’t stand the words
“It is written” when they are spoken by someone who firmly believes the truth. God’s Word
stands as an impenetrable fortress – not allowing the devil's flaming arrows of sin to harm the
person who, by faith, sits securely inside.
Yes, “It is written” is your rock, your tower, and your high mountain against the floods of
temptation. Jesus' perfect keeping of the law has made you righteous by faith. Remain in that
righteousness by remaining in the Word, and the devil will have to flee from you in frustration –
just as he fled from Christ.
“But,” someone might say, “what if I forget what God’s Word says? What if I sin?”
Well here is the truth, dear friend: none of us will ever be perfect in this life. We all sin! But
that is exactly why Christ came, and why our sermon text is so important: Jesus lived the perfect
life we all failed to live. He did this so that, through faith in him, we might have eternal life.
So even if we do fall into great sin, we still have Jesus' righteousness covering us – as St. John so
eloquently says: My dear children, I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody
does sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense--Jesus Christ, the Righteous One.
2 He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole
world. (1Jo 2:1-2 NIV84) 
It is written! When tempted, Jesus gave this answer to the devil in order to win our
righteousness. This is also the answer that keeps us in that righteousness. Let us, therefore, take
every opportunity to read, study and meditate on God’s Word so that we will have a ready refuge
to flee to when the waters of temptation flow against us. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",2/14/2016,
"“Don’t you fear God?” What a question, one that we would do well to ask ourselves. Don’t you
fear God – when you are tempted to tell someone a story about someone else that would make
them look silly, stupid or sinful? Don’t you fear God – when you are tempted to linger on the
internet late at night, looking at inappropriate pictures instead of just going to bed? Don’t you
fear God – when your alarm clock goes off on Sunday morning, but you go back to sleep instead
of accepting the LORD’s invitation to meet him in church? Don’t you fear God – when you
grumble and complain about people and events in your life?
“But,” someone might ask, “What, exactly, does it mean to fear God?” It means having a proper
respect for who the LORD is and our relationship with him. It includes recognition of his
absolute holiness and hatred of sin (facts that should make us afraid to disobey him, just as a
child is afraid to disobey his parents out of fear of being punished). More importantly, a proper
fear of God includes faith in his divine forgiveness, mercy and love (truths that move us to want
to obey him, just as little children want to please their loving parents). Is it any wonder, then,
that Luther’s Catechism starts every explanation of the Ten Commandments with the phrase:
“We should fear and love God. . .”?
Now, here is the irony of the question “don’t you fear God?”: the man asking it in our sermon
text is not Jesus or some angel from heaven; but a greedy robber whose entire life seems to have
been lived in opposition to God. And yet, in all earnestness, this criminal calls another to
repentance – asking him that soul searching question.
“Don’t you fear God?” Let us also ask ourselves this question this evening – learning from the
example of the criminal on the cross that true fear of God will move us to confess our total
sinfulness and make us bold to trust in God’s mercy for forgiveness.
Part One: Confess your sins to Him.
What kind of man was the criminal who confessed Christ from the cross? The fact that he was
crucified indicates that he was more than just a petty thief, but a violent, selfish robber who hurt
people to benefit himself. I imagine him to be a man who may have had some religious
instruction in the synagogue schools (as most Jewish boys would have had) but never took his
religion all too seriously. He didn’t fear God – that is to say, he wasn’t concerned about his
relationship with the LORD. His main concern was looking out for himself.
I can imagine this thief being like a man I once sat next to on an airplane – someone who (if my
other cabin mate was correct) was a member of the Russian mafia. When I told him I was
studying to be a pastor, he pulled out his pocket icon of Mary and Jesus, and kissed it.
“What hypocrisy!” we might think . . . and yet aren’t you and I just as guilty as he is – willing to
kiss Christ on Sunday, but living as if we don’t know him the rest of the week.
“What?” you might be thinking, “How am I in any way like the thief on the cross or the mafia
guy you mentioned?” Because, like them, we don’t always live in the fear of God. Don’t we,
more often than not, live for ourselves – doing all that we can to make our earthly lives better
without thinking about how we might use the gifts and talents God has given us in service to
him? All too often we go through the motions of our religion on Sunday but use our energies the
rest of the week to consume the things of this world. Isn’t it true that we sometimes live as if
there is no God or heaven, but that all that matters is what we can touch, taste, see, hear, smell
and experience on this earth?
This is how the criminal on the cross lived – until he came face to face with death. All the things
he held dear in life - his wealth and health, his freedom and physical comfort – were now taken
away. Great pain replaced them all with the threat of greater pain after he died. Even this, at
first, did not change this criminal’s heart towards God. He continued living defiantly – mocking
Jesus with the other thief.
But then something happened. We don’t know exactly what caused it, but this criminal started to
think about his impending death and what got him there – and it terrified him. He had lived his
whole life as if the LORD didn’t matter; and now he was about to die and stand before the God
he cared so little for in life. What comfort was the wealth he stole? What kind of eternity could
he expect?
As thoughts like these went through his mind, he saw Jesus who was crucified for being the
Messiah. “Could he be the Christ? A normal man, let alone a criminal, doesn’t pray for his
enemies like Jesus did – asking God to forgive them. And look at how he addressed God in that
prayer: as his Father . . .”
We don’t know how it happened or what caused it, but all of a sudden, the Holy Spirit awakened
a true fear of God in the heart of this criminal – one that recognized his own sin and looked to
Jesus as the Savior.
Therefore, when the other criminal who hung there hurled insults at him: “Aren’t you the
Christ? Save yourself and us!” This one replied: “Don’t you fear God . . . since you are under 
the same sentence? We are punished justly, for we are getting what our deeds deserve. But this
man has done nothing wrong.”
Make no mistake about it: the robber’s rebuke of the unbelieving criminal was an act of
repentance. He didn’t try to defend his life or ignore his sin. He didn’t bargain with God saying:
I have done more good than bad so you have to let me into heaven. No, he lays the truth out in
the open for both Jesus and the other criminal to hear: “There is no excusing my sin. I am getting
the punishment I deserve.”
This, then, is the first action of the man in whom a proper fear of the LORD has been created: he
will not make excuses for sin - belittling their seriousness or trying to hide them. No, rather, he
accepts what God says about the damning nature of sin and, in spite of how scary it is, lays the
truth before God. “I have sinned,” he says, “and deserve your eternal wrath and punishment for
them. I am completely wrong and am sorry that I have sinned against you. But, trusting in your
mercy, I ask you to forgive me for Jesus sake.”
Part Two: Trust in His Mercy.
Now it’s one thing for this criminal to rebuke the other and confess his own sinfulness, but look
at what happens next:
Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”
Understand this verse correctly: the criminal is not saying, “Jesus, have fond thoughts about how
I defended you when you get to heaven.” No, he is being far more audacious than that. He is in
effect saying: “Jesus, think about me as you accomplish your work: forgive my sin and bring me
to heaven.”
Now, what gives this criminal, who lived his entire life apart from God, who mocked and
blasphemed Jesus up to just moments before now. . . the right to ask the LORD for mercy, let
alone expect it? Actually he has the same right we have: none.
You heard me correctly, just like the criminal, we have no right, in-and-of ourselves, to expect
mercy from God. He is holy and sinless. We are not. So why, then, did the thief ask for
salvation – expecting to receive it?
Because when he looked at Jesus, he saw the Savior and remembered the Scripture’s promise of
unconditional mercy, forgiveness and love for everyone who looks to the Christ in repentance
and faith.
Where did the thief get this knowledge? We can’t know for certain, but if he grew up as an
average Jewish boy, we can imagine that he learned about the promised Messiah at school. (And
if this is the case, what does this tell us about the importance of Christian education today – even
for those who fall away after receiving it!) 
Perhaps the Holy Spirit used the memories of what the criminal had learned as a child and
combined them with reports he heard about Jesus in order to awaken the conviction in his heart
that Jesus is the Christ. The robber may have reasoned: “The LORD said that the Messiah
would suffer and die for the sins of all - promising to forgive all who turn to him in repentance
and faith. This, then, is what I will do. . .” And so he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come
into your kingdom,” that is to say: “Jesus save me from my sins because I am convinced that you
are the Christ, the innocent Lamb of God who is not suffering for any sin of his own, but for
mine.”
43 Jesus answered him, “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.”
Look at Jesus' reply and marvel! There is no hint of: “Why should I forgive you since you
blasphemed me?” or, “How do I know you’re truly sorry?” or, “I’ll forgive you when you do
something for me first.” No. Jesus offers the criminal complete forgiveness without charge –
treating the man as if he had never done any wrong; welcoming Him to his Father’s side in
heaven.
And do you know what? When we, like the criminal on the cross, have a proper fear of God -
humbling ourselves before the LORD in repentance and trusting in his mercy to forgive, God
opens heaven to us too - treating us as if we never did any wrong.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: Do you fear God - understanding that he is your almighty, holy
Creator who hates sin? Do you repent of your sins – confessing that you not only deserve every
bad thing that happens in your life but also an eternity in hell because of them? Are you bold to
both ask for and expect God’s forgiveness – not because you have earned or deserved it, but
simply because he promises to be merciful to you for Christ’s sake? Do you, in the peace of this
forgiveness, intend (with God’s help) to make every effort to stop living for yourself, but to live
for his glory?
If you answered yes to all these questions, then rejoice, because the Holy Spirit has awakened a
proper fear of God in your heart – one that sees the LORD for who he truly is: your righteous
God, who hates sin, and your loving Father, who has done everything to save you from it.
Rejoice, because then the words Jesus said to the criminal on the cross will one day be said to
you: “I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise.” Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",2/10/2016,
"I want to tell you a little story about poor listening and false expectations: My 2
nd grade teacher
told a riddle. “Next week,” she said, “we are going to do a science experiment: we are going to
make edible explosions.” Now, my seven-year-old boy mind focused more on the “explosion”
part of her riddle than the “edible”. Over the weekend I imaged every type of explosion I could
think of - from firecrackers to thermonuclear bombs! I was pretty certain my teacher would not
be allowed to detonate a “nuclear bomb” in class, but a boy can dream, can’t he?
Needless to say, I had high expectations. You can just imagine how let down I felt when the
experiment was nothing more than making “popcorn”. Think about it: edible explosions.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: when it comes to the area of religion, we are all tempted to act like
I did at age 7. God certainly promises to bless believers – and we are right to think about these
promises. The problem is that, instead of listening carefully to what God’s Word says about
these blessings, we let our imaginations run wild – dreaming about things ranging from having a
little extra income all the way to winning a billion-dollar lottery. We convince ourselves that
“God blessing us” means that He will take all our earthly problems away – allowing us to live an
easy trouble free life.
But are these the blessings God actually promised to give us? No, they aren’t. And it’s only
when we listen carefully to his Word that we find comfort in the forgiveness, life and salvation
with which he truly promises to bless us.
With the account of Jesus' transfiguration as our guide, let us be encouraged to Listen to Jesus.
Why? Because, as we will learn, 1) Jesus is the revealed glory of God, 2) Jesus is the focal point
of all Scripture, 3) Jesus is our future hope, 4) Jesus is the Savior God chose.
Part One: He is the revealed glory of God
Our sermon text takes place approximately 8 days after Peter confessed Jesus as the Christ – the
very Son of God.
i
 Sadly, the disciples had preconceived notions of what that confession meant.
They imagined him as someone who would reestablish David’s earthly kingdom and rule the
world in a political kind of way. When Jesus tried to correct his disciples by telling them about
his coming suffering, death and resurrection, they refused to listen. Peter even rebuked Jesus for
saying such things.
Now, the LORD knew that the disciples needed to have a correct understanding of who he is if
they wanted to be his apostles. And in order to know Jesus, they needed to abandon their earthly
imaginations and listen to him! Perhaps this is why he chose three of them to accompany him on
a little prayer retreat: so that they might know his true identity and mission.
We read: [Jesus] took Peter, John and James with him and went up onto a mountain to pray. 29
As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became as bright as a
flash of lightning.
Do you know what a geode is? It's an ordinary looking rock which, when you open it, contains
dazzling, colorful crystals. Even though we might know that an unopened geode is a geode, it’s
hard for us to conceive of the beauty inside that rock until it is revealed.
In a certain way, Jesus is like a geode. Even though the disciples knew that Jesus was more than
just a mere man, they couldn’t really conceive of who he was without seeing his glory. This is
why, even though Peter confessed him to be the Messiah, he still treated Jesus as a mere human
teacher when he rebuked him for talking about his impending suffering and death.
But Jesus was not just a mere human teacher; he is the glorious Son of God who, for our sake,
kept his glory hidden throughout his earthly life. Peter needed to know this so that he would stop
“imagining” and start listening to Jesus’ explanation of what kind of Savior he is. This is why
Jesus allowed his glory to shine.
How often aren't we like Peter who, just 8 days before this account, tried to tell Jesus what he
should and should not do. When trials and trouble come our way, we are often tempted to
complain and wonder why God isn't keeping his promise to ""bless"" us. ""Lord, this is not how it
should be. I am your child. Following you should improve my life, not make it worse."" Like
Peter, we often look for earthly ease and glory instead of the spiritual blessings God promises us 
in His Word. And when things don't go the way we think they should go, we grumble - which,
when you think about it, is trying to rebuke God for what he does.
This is one reason Jesus had his glorious transfiguration recorded for us in Scripture: he wants us
to know that He is not merely a great teacher whom we can chose to agree or disagree with. No,
Jesus is the all-glorious Son of God - perfect in righteousness and almighty in power. See his
divine glory and be silent. Stop dictating your life to him. Listen to his plans for your salvation.
Part Two: Jesus is the focal point of all Scripture
Two men, Moses and Elijah, 31 appeared in glorious splendor, talking with Jesus. They spoke
about his departure, which he was about to bring to fulfillment at Jerusalem.
Why did Moses and Elijah appear with Jesus? Many believe that Moses was to represent the Law
and Elijah the Prophets; for ""the Law and the Prophets"" was a popular term used to refer to the
Scriptures in Jesus' day.
So what does the sight of these two men speaking to Jesus about his departure signify? That all
Scripture centers on Jesus - pointing to his once for all sacrifice for our sins.
Peter and the rest of the disciples found it difficult to listen to Jesus talk about his departure.
They wanted to put it out of their minds. But Jesus' needed them to know the importance of his
crucifixion that they might not fall away on account of it. He needed them to understand that his
sacrifice for sin is the whole reason why he came.
This is why he allowed them to see Moses and Elijah in deep conversation with him about his
departure. These prophets did not try to dissuade Jesus from going to his cross like the disciples
did, but listened to what was about to happen and rejoiced in his work.
Many people treat the Bible as if it’s merely a rule book to life that we should read to solve our
earthly problems; and we are often tempted to treat it similarly. But the Scriptures were not
written to tell me how to be successful or live a good life. The Bible was written to point me to
Jesus – that I might know Him as my LORD and Savior from sin. Jesus once said: You diligently
study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the
Scriptures that testify about me.ii
 The who purpose of the Bible, therefore, is to lead me to repent
so that, through faith in God’s forgiving love for me, I might have the hope of eternal life with
him in paradise.
Part Three: Jesus is our future hope.
32 Peter and his companions were very sleepy, but when they became fully awake, they saw his
glory and the two men standing with him. 33 As the men were leaving Jesus, Peter said to him,
""Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us put up three shelters--one for you, one for Moses and
one for Elijah."" (He did not know what he was saying.)
Jesus’ transfiguration had its desired effect on Peter, James and John. They were so awestruck
with Jesus’ glory that they wanted to bask in it forever. It was, quite literally, heaven on earth!
But, as wonderful as the experience was, it was only a sample - a divine appetizer of the great
eternal feast that is yet to come. Jesus still needed to prepare this feast, and the only way he
could do it was through the sacrifice of himself on the cross. If the disciples kept their eyes and
ears on Jesus, they would learn how and when this glorious sacrifice would save them.
And what can we learn from this little glimpse of glory – recorded for us in Scripture? That our
true joy is not found in the things of this earth. Our true joy is found in the place every Christian
desires to be: at our Savior’s side in heaven.
And this is why we need to listen to Jesus – paying careful attention to every word He speaks to
us in Scripture. Jesus is our only way to heaveniii
. Sure, life on this earth may seem great at
times – something we want to hold on to. But as great as this world may seem, it is not our true
home. Listen to what Jesus says: Do not love the world or anything in the world. . . The world
and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever.iv
 And what is
God’s will? To believe in the one he has sent.v
Yes, listen to Jesus tell you about your future hope. And why should you believe him? Because,
as we will see next, he is the Savior God chose.
Part Four: He is the Savior God chose.
To impress upon Peter, James and John – and all who would read this account – the importance
of listening to every word Jesus says, God the Father made an appearance.
While [Peter] was speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them, and they were afraid as they
entered the cloud. 35 A voice came from the cloud, saying, ""This is my Son, whom I have chosen;
listen to him.""
The cloud that appeared over the disciples was the same majestic cloud that protected the
Israelites on their 40 year journey from Egypt to Canaan and terrified them at Mount Sinai when
God spoke his commandments from it. It is called “the Glory of the LORD” and whenever it
appears in Scripture, the all-holy, Almighty LORD himself is present.
God the Father wanted Peter, James and John to know for certain that Jesus is the Christ - the
chosen Savior to whom the whole Bible points. Even though Jesus’ appearance was like that of
any man, he is God the Son. Therefore God says: “Listen to Him” – that is: Don’t talk back to
him. Don’t argue, complain or try to change what he says. “Listen to Him.” Take every
opportunity to carefully hear what he says and hold it as your highest treasure – as if nothing in
all the world mattered compare to it; because, truth be told, nothing else does!
And then, in a flash, the glimpse of Jesus’ divine glory was gone. He stood alone before the
three disciples – approachable and altogether human. Eight days earlier they had confessed him 
as the Christ. Now they began to comprehend what that confession meant - and so do we! Now
their hearts and minds were more inclined to treat him – not as an equal, but as the divine Savior
He truly is. No, they still didn’t understand everything Jesus said about his work, but they
listened and, when Jesus work was finished, recalled what Jesus said and believed.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: Like the disciples, we might not understand everything Jesus tells
us in His Word, but if we listen carefully to what He says, we will nevertheless grow in faith,
love and hope.
So, when it comes to the Bible, don’t be like seven- year-old me who only paid attention to half
of the riddle his teacher told him. Be careful to listen to everything Jesus tells you. Why?
Because He is the revealed glory of God. He is the focal point of all Scripture. He is our future
Hope. He is the Savior God chose. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",2/7/2016,
"Imagine a Christian friend of yours has fallen into some sort of unrepentant sin (like living with
their boy or girl friend outside of marriage) and you have firsthand knowledge of it. How
comfortable would you feel talking to them about their relationship with God?
I’d tell you how I’d feel: terrified! Yes, you heard me correctly: I would feel down right terrified
talking to someone else about their sin. Why? Probably for the same reasons you would!
Wouldn’t I be a hypocrite – warning them of their sins, when I am far from perfect? What
should I say? How and when should I say it? What if they get mad at me? What if I make
things worse – pushing them away from Christ because of their perception of me being
“judgmental”?
Do any of those excuses sound familiar?
“Well pastor,” someone might be thinking, “you better get over those fears because it is your job
to warn those living in unrepentant sin; and I have a long list of people for you to warn . . .”
Wait a second: whose job is it to initially warn someone caught in sin? Did Jesus say: ""If your
brother sins against you, go and show his fault to the pastor”? No, he said: ""If your brother sins
against you, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have
won your brother over.”
i

We all have the duty of being our brothers’ keeper – watching over each others’ souls. If you
have firsthand knowledge of someone living in impenitent sin, God does not want you to get
someone else to talk to that person. He wants you to talk to them yourself. It is only if our oneon-one
call to repentance fails that we should get another Christian (like a pastor or an elder)
involved to help.
“Are you kidding me?” someone might be thinking, “There is no way I would confront a friend
with their sin!”
Then, let me ask you this: If you saw a child about to run onto the street that a truck is driving
down, would you stop the child? Of course you would. You wouldn’t want a child to die if you
could have saved it! Then why wouldn’t you also want to prevent a Christian friend from dying
eternally in hell because of their impenitent sin?
“But who am I to do this? Isn’t their sin between them and their God?” Not when you have
firsthand knowledge of it.
The LORD has called all of us to be his ambassadors to our family, friends and neighbors. With
the calling of Jeremiah as our example, let us consider how he equips and help us to accomplish
this task, under the theme: Don’t be afraid of confessing Christ. 1) The LORD has set you
apart. 2) The LORD promises to be with you. 3) The LORD has given you the words to say.
Part One: The LORD has set you apart.
Jeremiah lived during a sad time in Jewish history. They had fallen into such gross idolatry that
some of them even sacrificed their own children to foreign gods. Even though Josiah, the king
who reigned when Jeremiah was born, tried to spark a reformation, God saw what was in the
hearts of his people, and it was not good. This is why the LORD commissioned Jeremiah to
speak all the words He would give him, so as to warn Judah – lest they fall under God’s eternal
judgment for their continued, impenitent idolatry.
Jeremiah writes: 4
The word of the LORD came to me, saying, 5
""Before I formed you in the
womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart.”
What the LORD said of Jeremiah could have easily been said of each one of us. Before forming
us in our mother’s womb, the LORD knew each one of us completely and chose to save us - not
because of how “perfect” and “god pleasing” we would be. No, he knew the opposite to be true:
that we would be born in sin - slaves to worldly passions. And yet, in spite of who we would be,
God chose us to be his dearly loved children whom he would redeem for himself through Jesus’
sacrifice for our sins. He formed us in our mother’s wombs– individually giving us all the
abilities and disabilities he determined us to have that we might accomplish his will for our lives.
God knew, chose, and formed you into the person you are today. He set you apart as someone
who would become his dearly loved child through Baptism. He did this for a purpose: that you
might live for his glory and not your own
The LORD told Jeremiah: I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.""
Now, it is certainly true that none of us were appointed to be “prophets” the way Jeremiah was.
We all have different vocations in life – callings that God wants us to pursue to his glory. 
Pastors and elders, for example, are specifically called by God to watch over his people –
warning them of the dangers of sin and unbelief. At the same time, God has called all Christians
to be his ambassadorsii
- desiring that our words and actions confess his glory to others.
iii
So, in a certain sense, we are like Jeremiah, for we are God’s royal priests in the world – chosen,
redeemed and appointed by the LORD himself to reflect his love and proclaim his salvation in all
we say and do. And since the LORD himself has formed us for this task at our very conception,
there is no reason we should be afraid of confessing Christ to our family, friends and neighbors –
especially the ones who have fallen into unrepentant sin.
Part Two: The LORD promises to be with you.
Now, just because there is no reason for us to be afraid of calling our friends to repentance and
faith, doesn’t mean we aren’t. We know our sins and weaknesses all too well. We aren’t
pastors, but inexperienced lay people who haven’t received theological training for this kind of
work. Wouldn’t it be better if someone with more experience did it?
This was, in effect, Jeremiah’s answer to God: ""Ah, Sovereign LORD,"" I said, ""I do not know
how to speak; I am only a child."" Based on how long Jeremiah’s ministry was, it doesn’t sound
like he was exaggerating. Most people think that Jeremiah was around 20 years old when the
LORD called him, and quite possibly even less!
Could you imagine the LORD appearing to you, just after you graduated from high school,
telling you that He has made you his special prophet whom he chose to go before Congress and
the Senate to condemn this nation for all its godlessness?
If you can imagine this, then you can imagine Jeremiah’s call and can sympathize with his fear
and astonishment. “LORD, you have the wrong guy. Send someone else.”
But listen to how the LORD responds to Jeremiah: ""Do not say, 'I am only a child.' You must go
to everyone I send you to and say whatever I command you.
It is as if God were saying: “Your inexperience and fear are no excuse, Jeremiah, and I don’t
want to hear you mention them again. Why not? Because I am the one who chose, formed and
appointed you for this purpose from the creation of the world. This is not a job interview. You
will go to whomever I, your heavenly Father, send you – speaking to them the very words I give
you?”
When Jeremiah let his fear get in the way of obeying God, he sinned – and so do we when we act
like the reluctant prophet. God has graciously given us every gift necessary to carry out his
purpose for our lives. Making excuses instead of doing what God says is not only a sin, it is a
sign of unbelief – showing that we don’t trust God enough to watch over us as we do what he
commands.
This is why, after a swift rebuke, the LORD offers Jeremiah a wonderful promise to strengthen
his faith: 8 Do not be afraid of them, for I am with you and will rescue you,"" declares the LORD.
This promise applies to you too, dear Christian: Don't be afraid of how your friends react as
your reach out to them in love - pleading with them to repent of their sins and turn back to Christ
in faith. The almighty LORD who created this awesome universe stands beside you – ever ready
to rescue you at a moment’s notice.
Yes, the Almighty LORD is with us as we confess Christ to the straying, but please understand
this verse in its proper perspective. It does not mean our ministry will be easy. Jesus has clearly
said that, for his sake, we can expect trouble on this earth. Jeremiah's ministry is a vivid
demonstration of this fact - being despised, slandered, accused of treason and imprisoned for
warning Judah of their sin. But, through it all, the LORD stood by him - giving him unseen
victory after unseen victory, rescuing him from every evil he had to suffer.
And what the LORD did for Jeremiah, he will also do for us. Our task of calling a straying
brother or sister to repentance is never easy, but it is the LORD's will that we do it. He promises
to stand by us through it all - rescuing us from every danger that threatens our body and soul.
More than this, he promises to give us the very words to say.
Part Three: The LORD has given you the words to say.
Jeremiah writes: Then the LORD reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me,
""Now, I have put my words in your mouth. 10 See, today I appoint you over nations and kingdoms
to uproot and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant.""
Could you imagine what that would have been like: the Almighty LORD touching your lips to
reassure you that He has given you His Word! Now, it is true that Jeremiah was given God's
Word in a very special way. The Holy Spirit verbally inspired His message. His prophecies of
God's judgment and grace for Judah, Egypt, Babylon and all the other nations surrounding him
were very specific and all came true. At the same time, what God did for Jeremiah, he also does
for us.
No, none of us are verbally inspired, nor have we felt God physically touch our lips. But he has
given us His Word and Spirit. He also has given us the same twofold task that He gave
Jeremiah: first of all to use his Law to uproot and tear down the sinful pride in a person’s heart
that prevents them from repenting of their sin and turning to Jesus for forgiveness. And when
that has been accomplished, to use the Gospel of Christ's sacrifice on our behalf to plant and
build - that is, to forgive, comfort, encourage and strengthen a repentant Christian in their
relationship with God through faith in Christ Jesus.
Members of Immanuel: what do you say to your Christian friend or family member who is
straying from God? You don't have to wonder: it’s all right here in the Bible. Simply speak the
truth in love: showing them their sins and the spiritual danger they are in from God's Word -
pleading with them to repent. And when they do repent? Show them the forgiveness that is 
theirs in Christ Jesus: how he suffered and died for all their sins so that they might be at peace
with God and live with him forever in heaven. It is all right here in the Word.
So, don't be afraid to confess Christ to your family, friends and neighbors - calling them to
repentance and faith. Why not? Because, as you have learned: The LORD has set you apart for
this work. He promises to be with you and he promises to give you the very words you are to say.
Find comfort in these facts and gladly do the work God has given you - ever remembering what
he says about it: My brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should
bring him back, remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him
from death and cover over a multitude of sins..
 Amen.
",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",1/31/2016,
"When the LORD commanded the Israelites to remember the Sabbath day, he wanted his people
to do more than just refrain from work and go to a synagogue for worship. He wanted his people
to spend an entire day meditating on who he is and their relationship with him.
Even though the outward specifics of the Sabbath command do not apply to New Testament
Christians, God still wants us to set aside time to rest – meditating on him and his Word. Why?
Because he knows how important such meditation is to our overall welfare – giving us courage
to face the trials of life, warning us away from the sinful traps of the world, and offering us
forgiveness and hope when we are overwhelmed with guilt.
Yes, in a world full of deadlines and stress, it is important for us to take frequent, meditative
“Sabbath” breaks - reflecting on our God. With the 19th Psalm as our guide, let us do this, under
the theme: Help me see your Glory . . . 1) As I consider your creation, O God; 2) As I meditate
on your Word, O LORD; 3) As I apply your Law and Gospel to my life.
Part One: As I consider your creation, O God.
Our Psalm begins: The heavens are telling how wonderful God is, and the sky announces what
His hands have made.
2 One day tells the next a lively story, and one night informs the next 3
without talking, without words, without a voice that can be heard. 4
Yet their sound goes out all
over the earth, and what they say to the most distant parts of the world. He has set up a tent in the
heavens for the sun,
5
and it comes like a bridegroom out of his chamber. Like a strong man it
delights to run along its path, 6
starting from one end of the sky and moving around to the other.
Nothing can hide from its glowing heat.
The majesty of a sunrise and serenity of a sunset; the peace of a rainbow after a wicked
thunderstorm and the grandeur of a clear, starry night – all these things (and many others like
them) give me pause. I can’t help but say a pray of thanksgiving when I experience them. Why?
Because they all reveal to me the glory of our God – giving me insight as to who He is and
proclaiming his wisdom, power, providence and love.
Now, someone might disagree, saying: “When I consider the vastness of the universe, I doubt
how any god could have created it. It is so infinitely large that our small planet is not even
equivalent to a speck of sand in the vast Sahara Desert. How could any “one” being create
hundreds of billions of galaxies, each containing billions to trillions of stars – with just as many
planets orbiting them? How can any being be mindful of all the thoughts of the billions of
people on this earth, provide for the trillions of animals and insects and count the countless
molecules and atoms that compose just our world – let alone the infinite universe? How is this
possible?”
It’s possible because of who God actually is. We call God “eternal, Almighty and all-knowing”
but we rarely reflect on what these terms actually mean. All our thoughts of God and what He is
capable of are tiny compared to the reality of his being. Modern astronomy has opened our
minds to understand that when the Bible calls God almighty, it means that he is ALL mighty.
Creation testifies to the limitless power and wisdom of our God.
Now I must admit that when I look at the starry, night sky – considering the vastness of this
universe – I often feel all too small. What value can I have to God among the billions of people
who live on this earth? How can I mean anything to him?
Then I remember the Scriptures which say: What is man that you are mindful of him, the son of
man that you care for him? 5
You made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned
him with glory and honor. (Psalm 8:4-5 NIV84)
This is the amazing thing about the LORD: even though the universe is so vast, proclaiming a
greatness of God beyond imagination, yet this great and awesome God focuses his attention on
you and me! This is both scary and wonderful beyond compare. It is scary because my
conscience testifies that I have sinned against God and deserve his eternal wrath and punishment
in hell. It is also wonderful because, as the Scriptures proclaim, our infinite God knows and
loves us so much that he became like us in order to save us from our sins. This is something we
cannot learn from creation but can only learn from his Word. 
This is why King David - when speaking in this Psalm about how creation proclaims the glories
of God - never uses the name “LORD” - reserving that special name of God’s grace for when he
speaks about the revelation God gives us of himself in the Bible.
Let us, therefore, meditate on how the Bible reveals God’s glory.
Part Two: As I meditate on your Word, O LORD.
David writes: The LORD’s word is perfect – that is, absolutely complete. Nothing is to be added
to it or subtracted from it, nor should its meaning be changed in any way. Through it alone the
LORD calls us to repentance and faith in Jesus – offering us new spiritual life. It refreshes,
revives, and comforts weak and burdened consciences.
The LORD’s Word is also described as truth that can be trusted. And why is that? Because, as
the Scriptures say, God is not a man, that he should lie, nor a son of man, that he should change
his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill? (Number 23:19
NIV84).
Yes, we can believe everything God’s Word says – even if it goes against all the wisdom of the
scientists and philosophers of this age. They don’t know what happened at creation – they were
not there. But the LORD was. He is our all-knowing God, who grants divine wisdom to all who
believe his words with a simple faith.
The LORD’s instructions are right – they show us the correct path to take in life - always leading
us to Jesus and his teaching about our salvation and the effect it has on our lives. Jesus’
teachings delight the mind, that is to say, they gladden our hearts as we meditate on them.
The LORD’s commandment is pure, a light for the eyes. And which commandment is that? The
one Jesus spoke to his disciples on the night of his betrayal: ""A new command I give you: Love
one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.” (John 13:34 NIV84) How is
this commandment a light for our eyes? Because it, first of all, points to how the LORD has
saved us. Then it tells us how we can live as the people he declared us to be through faith in him
– expressing the same love to others that he expressed to us.
9
The LORD’s command to fear Him is clean and forever the same – that is to say that the
Gospel causes one to fear God correctly: not in terror as his enemy, but in love and faith just like
a little child respects the authority of his loving father.
The LORD’s decisions are true and altogether right. His law exposes and condemns the evil
lurking in the human heart. His Gospel tells us that we are forgiven because of Christ’s
suffering, death and resurrection on our behalf. All who repent and believe in Jesus are free
from all sin. Eternal life is theirs.
When we meditate on the wonderful revelation the LORD gives us in His Word, how can our
hearts not burn with love for him? He who created and sustains this infinitely vast and intricate 
universe loved you and me so much that He took on human flesh and blood in order to save us.
Yes, the revelation of these truths is to be desired more than gold, more than plenty of fine gold.
They’re sweeter than honey, even when it flows from the honeycomb.
Part Three: As I apply your Law and Gospel to my life.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: we must understand that the time we spend contemplating God’s
power demonstrated in creation and his mercy as revealed in Scripture will do us no good until
we, with the Spirit’s help, take one more step: apply these truths to ourselves. And this is exactly
what David does in the last portion of our Psalm, when he writes:
11 Your servant gets light from. If we keep them, we get a great reward.
Yes, there are great benefits in keeping the LORD’s Law and Gospel. The Law is a light that
shows us our sins and need for forgiveness. The Gospel is a light that shows us God’s love and
our salvation in Christ. When we believe, treasure, guard and obey both his Law and Gospel, the
LORD showers us with many spiritual blessings – not because we have merited them; rather
simply because He has set up his Word as the spigot through which he pours out his blessings
upon us.
Applying these truths will lead us to repent of all sin. It will also lead us to ask the LORD to
keep us from sinful rebellion, as David writes next: 12 Who can know his unintentional errors?
Cleanse me from hidden faults. 13 Above all keep Your servant from proud sins; don’t let them get
control over me. Then I’ll be blameless and innocent of any great wrong.
Yes, meditating on our relationship with God in Christ will have a profound impact on how we
live our lives. It will move us to repent of and avoid sin, to live to God’s glory, and to face every
trial with courage and hope.
May these truths, then, ever lead us to take some time every day – to meditate on the glory of
God proclaimed in creation and revealed in his Word – ever applying what we learned to our
lives. Then we will be led to pray with King David:
14 May what I say please You and what I think be what You like, O LORD, my Rock and my
Redeemer. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",1/24/2016,
"In vino veritas is a Latin saying meaning “in wine is truth."" If you give a person enough wine,
you can often learn things you otherwise wouldn't.
Today, however, I am using this Latin phrase in a much different sense. The first miracle
recorded of Jesus’ public ministry was changing water into wine; and it reveals important facts
about our relationship with Jesus. Let us consider some of them, under the theme: In Vino Jesu
Veritas: Four Truths we can learn from Jesus turning water into wine. 1) A truth about
asking Jesus. 2) A truth about faith. 3) A truth about Jesus’ compassion. 4) A truth about
hidden miracles.
Part One: A truth about asking Jesus
Our sermon text takes place shortly after Jesus' baptism, less than a week after he called his first
disciples. We read:
On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, 2
and Jesus
and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.
Based on how Mary’s role is described at this feast, it seems as if she were more than a mere
guest. Could this wedding have been for a relative of Jesus? It's very possible. Whatever the
case, Mary cared deeply for the hosts – and so did Jesus, as we will soon see.
Ancient Jewish wedding feasts were more than just one-day events. Due to the distance people
had to travel, they were week-long affairs – full of feasting, joy and conversation. If you keep
this in mind, you can understand how easy it would be to run out of food or drink.
We read: When the wine was gone, Jesus' mother said to him, ""They have no more wine.""
Why did Jesus’ mother do this? I am convinced it’s because she knew who her Son was and had
been patiently waiting for him to reveal himself to the world. For 30 years Jesus kept his identity
a secret, but now, at his baptism, God the Father publicly anointed him with the Holy Spirit and
declared that he was his Son. Jesus was gathering disciples for himself. The stage was all set, so
why shouldn’t Jesus reveal his true nature here, in front of his family and friends?
And so Mary, trusting in her Son’s power and compassion, merely mentions to him the fact that
there is no wine.
Here, therefore, is the first truth I would like us to consider from this account: what is the proper
way to ask Jesus for something? Much can be learned from Mary. How did she approach Jesus?
In full confidence of who he was. She did not let thoughts of whether or not Jesus “would” or
“could” answer her request prevent her from making it. She also did not demand specifics as to
how Jesus should answer her. All she did was mention the problem – simply laying it before him
- and let him decide to do what is best.
What an example for us! Jesus wants us to humbly lay our requests before him in prayer –
trusting in his mercy and love. We can ask Him for anything; even for the things we might
consider unimportant, like being saved from embarrassment for a minor social indiscretion.
Jesus loves it when we have the faith to do this – not pushing our own agendas or timetables, but
always open to the good and gracious answer he will give as our Savior and God.
The way Mary asked Jesus teaches us this important truth. Let us see how he answered.
Part Two: A truth about faith
""Dear woman, why do you involve me?"" Jesus replied.
“Why does Jesus call his mother “dear woman” instead of Mom? Isn’t that being disrespectful?”
Consider Jesus’ response in its proper perspective: it is not the response of a son talking to his
mother, but of the LORD speaking to His creation.
Jesus also knows the “unspoken reason” Mary mentioned the wine to him, which was more than
just saving the hosts from embarrassment. She wanted Jesus to finally reveal himself as the
Messiah. This is why Jesus responded the way he did: ""My time has not yet come,"" he tells her. 
That is to say: when the time is right for me to publicly reveal my glory, I will. That time,
however, has been set by God the Father to accomplish His will and cannot be changed.
The fact that Jesus called her “dear woman” seemed to comfort Mary more than offend her.
How? Because she recognized his response was not that of a son to a mother, but as a Savior to
his disciple. In his time he would do what is best! Comforted by this thought she got ready for
whatever action he chose.
His mother said to the servants, ""Do whatever he tells you.""
Here is the second truth we can learn from this account: what it means to have faith. Mary, yet
again, serves as a wonderful example. Even though it may have seemed as if Jesus didn’t care to
answer her request, she trusted that he did and made herself ready to any response he would
make. So should we when we pray.
Often times we get frustrated because Jesus does not give us a definite answer to our requests.
When this happens we are tempted to doubt. Instead of us being ready to do whatever He tells us,
we want him to be ready to do what we tell him. But this is not right and reveals a lack of faith.
Learn from Mary’s example: if Jesus does not answer our prayer in the time and way we want,
don't worry. Be like Mary and trust that, whatever he does, it will be for our good. And be ready
for his answer. Be ready to do whatever he tells you - trusting in His compassion.
Part Three: A Truth about Jesus’ compassion
6 Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each
holding from twenty to thirty gallons. 7
Jesus said to the servants, ""Fill the jars with water""; so
they filled them to the brim.
8
Then he told them, ""Now draw some out and take it to the master
of the banquet."" They did so, 9
and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been
turned into wine.
The act of filling those 20-30 gallon jars with water was, in and of itself, nothing special. Water
was constantly used for ceremonial washings. The servants may have merely thought Jesus was
merely getting water ready for some purification rite. But when Jesus then told them to take
some to the master of the Banquet, they must have wondered what Jesus was doing.
What Jesus was doing was expressing compassion. In a world of problems, running out of choice
drink at a party where people are otherwise well fed does not seem like it would occupy the top
of God’s to-do list. And even though it would cause nothing more than minor embarrassment for
the hosts, Jesus had compassion: both on his mother and on the bridal pair.
And the truth to be learned here is this: Jesus has compassion for us – even in the littlest thing.
We should never think that something is too small to take to him in prayer. And if Jesus is
compassionate when we face small problems, how can we not trust his mercy in regards to the
major trials we face? If he helps us in the little things, how will he not help us with the big? 
Yes, our Savior is most certainly compassionate - even going so far as to suffer and die on the
cross for our sins. And if God has done this for us in Christ, how will he not also, along with him,
graciously give us all things? (Romans 8:32, NIV84) We, therefore, have every reason to trust
in Jesus' compassion.
Part Four: A truth about hidden miracles
The master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not realize
where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the
bridegroom aside 10 and said, ""Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper
wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now."" 11 This,
the first of his miraculous signs, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed his glory,
and his disciples put their faith in him.
A great miracle had taken place. It should have made headline news - but almost no one knew it
happened. Only those who already looked to Jesus in faith were able to perceive it. Who were
they? Jesus’ mother, the servants who trusted and did what Jesus commanded, and the 6
disciples Jesus had previously called. Their faith was strengthened. But to the rest, Jesus
remained a mystery.
And here is the last truth I would like for us to consider this morning: the truth about hidden
miracles. Faithful Christians have a totally different world view than the rest of humanity. The
people of this world can’t even begin to comprehend the compassion Jesus has for them. The
unbeliever sees the food he eats as a result of his labor; the believer, however, sees it as a gift of
God’s love. The unbeliever sees his health as a result of his efforts, the believer as a miracle of
God’s protection. The unbeliever sees recovery from an illness as a result of human science; the
believer praises God for his undeserved healing.
Hidden miracles of protection and providence are around us every day. For some of us who have
struggle financially, we might remember how, when things seemed darkest, all of a sudden a
needed rebate check or tax break came through to help us at just the right moment. Others might
remember how, when we needed it most, some stranger offered us needed encouragement, or
some music or event directed our thoughts to God's promises.
But the greatest of all of God's hidden miracles is the forgiveness and salvation Jesus won for us
on His cross. He has paid for the sins of every person on this earth, regardless whether or not
they perceive it. Sadly, however, most people are blind to this great miracle of compassion. They
don't want to believe and therefore do not see it.
Praise God that he has revealed it to us through the preaching of his Gospel. By means of his
Holy Spirit working through Word and Sacrament, God has awakened faith in our hearts to know
Jesus for who he truly is. And this faith changes us. No longer do we look at things from a 
worldly point of view, but understand that God is active everywhere, working in all things for the
benefit of those who love him.
In vino Jesu veritas – In Jesus' miracle of wine is truth. What are these truths? To humbly ask
Jesus for anything - even if it may seem insignificant; to trust that Jesus will answer – ready to
do whatever he says; to know that Jesus has great compassion for us; and finally to rejoice in all
the hidden miracles Jesus performs in our life – especially the miracle of moving our hearts to
repent and believe in him for the forgiveness of our sins. May the LORD ever lead us to be
thankful for our Savior’s great compassion, helping us express our gratitude like Jesus’ first
disciples: in dedicating our lives to him. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",1/17/2016,
"“You just wouldn’t understand!” Have you ever said this to someone trying to help? Why?
Was it because you were too embarrassed to admit a sin? Maybe you truly felt like they would
not understand the temptation, trial or pain you were going through because they have never
been in your shoes. And, if they haven’t experienced it, how can they help?
Now let me ask you another question: have you ever felt this way about Jesus? Sure, we pray to
him all the time, but do we truly believe that he “gets” us: that he actually understands all the
trials and temptations we face – and, on top of this, has the willingness and power to help?
We should because, as we will learn in our sermon for today, Jesus' Baptism reveals Him as
both completely like us (and therefore able to sympathize with our weaknesses) and also totally
unlike us (having the power to forgive our sins and give us final victory in all our trials). Let us
then learn to call upon him in every trouble and need.
Part One: Jesus' Baptism reveals him as completely like us: true man!
One complaint often lodged against pastors is that they can’t really understand the problems laypeople
face at work and at home. And, in a certain sense, this is true. We don’t face the threat of
unemployment hanging over many workers during a down economy. We don’t face unbelieving
coworkers who mock us for our faith, or atheistic college professors whose “not-so-secret”
agenda it is to convert their students away from religion.
Truth be told, I don’t think there is a person here who can fully understand the trials and
temptations of another unless they have walked in their shoes – experiencing the same things
they have experienced. This is yet another reason we should always be quick to listen and slow
to speak, as the Bible says - not hastily judging a person but, in everything, lovingly pointing
them to God’s Word for correction, forgiveness and help.
We may not be able to completely understand or help a person with what they are going through,
but God always can. Why? Because he is omniscient – knowing all things! He knows the
perverseness that lies deep in the human heart: the corruption of our nature that always desires 
sin. He sees every situation we face and also knows all the evils that are done to us through no
fault of our own.
He is our Creator who sees and knows all - and this is one reason why he took it upon himself to
save us. How? By taking on human flesh and blood in order to be tempted in every way just as
we are and yet remain without sin. He did this so that he could give us his record of
righteousness as a free gift through faith. He did this so that he could suffer and die for all our
sins so that we might have eternal life.
Yes, our God can absolutely understand us because Jesus is like us in every way: a flesh and
blood human, who experienced temptation, pain, suffering, loss, joy, sorrow and everything else
we can imagine. He knows what it is like to be a child, a teen, and an adult. For 30 years he
lived like everyone else did in his community –working hard for his earthly father by learning
the trade of carpentry. He knew what it was to struggle for food and face want. Jesus was so
much like us, that no one before his baptism actually knew him.
And this is why I find the first verse of our sermon text so comforting: When all the people were
being baptized, Jesus was baptized too.
Think about what this verse means: there our Savior stood – in a crowd of people –
indistinguishable from anyone else. Even John the Baptist said: “I would not have known him,
except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The man on whom you see the
Spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’”i
 And when John,
figuring Jesus was the Savior, tried to prevent Him from being baptized, He replied: it is proper
for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness.
ii
“Since baptism is a sacrament of repentance for the forgiveness of sin,” we might ask, “what
need would the sinless Savior have for it?” The answer is: even though He was sinless, God the
Father laid all our sins upon him and, for this reason, Jesus needed to be baptized for their
forgiveness.
Jesus baptism, therefore, reveals him as a human being – just like us – who knows what it feels
like to carry the burden of our specific sins because that is exactly what he carried to the cross.
Jesus is like us – so much so that he is not ashamed to call us his brothers.
And if he is like us, then we can go to him in prayer – confident that he knows our needs and
understands us completely. Through the preaching of his Word He calls us to repent of our sins
and trust in him for their forgiveness. He is the answer to every problem we face in life. We can
trust in him to get us through every trial, temptation and sin because, as Christ’s baptism shows,
he is not just a man, completely like us: he is also the Son of God, who is completely unlike us,
and therefore has the power to help.
Part Two: Totally unlike us: The divine Christ
What public wonders occurred when Jesus was baptized! We read: as [Jesus] was praying,
heaven was opened and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove.
As He so often did in his ministry, Jesus prayed. For what? We don’t know exactly, but I can
imagine that it was that the Father bring glory to his name through the ministry into which he
was about to be anointed.
You see, the words “Christ” and “Messiah” both mean the same thing: the anointed one.
Anointing was the Old Testament custom of pouring oil on someone to install him into a public
office. This custom was a living symbol – foreshadowing the day that God the Father would
publically pour out the Holy Spirit on the promised Savior, giving Him every gift necessary to
accomplish our salvation.
And this is exactly what happened to Jesus, in fulfillment of the prophecy recorded in Isaiah: “A
shoot will come up from the stump of Jesse; from his roots a Branch will bear fruit. 2
The Spirit
of the LORD will rest on him-- the Spirit of wisdom and of understanding, the Spirit of counsel
and of power, the Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.”iii And again: Here is my
servant, whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom I delight; I will put my Spirit on him.iv
Jesus' baptism, therefore, reveals him as the Christ, the long awaited Savior from sin. Not only
that, but, at his baptism, a voice came from heaven, and said “You are my Son, whom I love; with
you I am well pleased.”
In other words, Jesus isn’t just a man: He is the divine Son of God in human flesh and blood
who has the power to save us from the evils that threaten our bodies and souls. And God the
Father loves him – not just because Jesus is His eternal Son, but because He willingly submitted
to his Father’s will to save us from our sins through his suffering, death and resurrection.
So you see, brothers and sisters in Christ, just as it is comforting to know Jesus is a man, who
can sympathize with our every weakness, so it is even more comforting to know him as our
divine Savior who, unlike us, is the holy, all powerful God – possessing both the power and love
to reconcile us lost sinners with God the Father.
Yes, Jesus' baptism definitely reveals how he is unlike us. But it also shows something else: it
shows us how, through faith in His work, we can become children of God – just like him. How
so? Because all the events that happened at Jesus’ baptism also happened at ours.
“But how can that be?” you might ask. “I have witnessed many baptisms and have never seen
heaven open and the Spirit descending like a dove. I have never heard the Father’s voice.” Well,
just because we have not seen these things happen with our physical eyes doesn’t mean that they
aren’t a spiritual reality. They are, and with the help of God’s Word I will show you how.
Let’s start with heaven being opened. Because of sin, heaven is naturally closed to all people.
But because Christ suffered and died for our sin, that great curtain no longer blocks our approach
to God, as the Scriptures say: 14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone
through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess. . . 16 Let us 
then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace
to help us in our time of need.v
 And again: In him and through faith in him we may approach
God with freedom and confidence.vi
As you can see, heaven is open to all who believe in Christ for the forgiveness of sins. But what
about the Holy Spirit being given to us at our baptism?
Consider Peter’s words spoken at Pentecost: ""Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the
name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy
Spirit.vii Consider also what the apostle Paul said in our first lesson: [God] saved us through the
washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit,6 whom he poured out on us generously
through Jesus Christ our Savior.
viii
And, finally, there is God the Father’s declaration that we are his dearly loved children.
Consider the Scriptures that say: You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus, 27 for all
of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.ix
 And again: How
great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And
that is what we are!x
So you see, brothers and sisters in Christ: Jesus' baptism not only shows how Jesus is the Savior
– both like and unlike us. It also shows us how we, who are unlike him, are declared to be like
him: dearly loved children of God, perfect and holy because our sins have been washed onto
Jesus and, by his work, forgiven. God’s gift of the Holy Spirit proves all this to be true!
Is there some temptation, trial or tribulation wearing you down? Do you feel as if no one
understands you, that there is no one who can help? Then turn to Jesus remembering who He
was revealed to be at his baptism. Pray to him - repenting of your sins and remembering his love
for you. Study His Word for solace, forgiveness, counsel and advice. Come to communion to
remember the great sacrifice he underwent to redeem you for God. Remember also your
baptism, and the great blessings of the Holy Spirit, an open heaven and being declared a child of
God. By doing this, God will strengthen your faith and give you the hope you need. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",1/10/2016,
"Of the many things Christians would like to know more about, Jesus’ childhood ranks high on the
list. The Bible, however, has not been given to satisfy our idle curiosity. Every fact and account
is given for the purpose of teaching us the things God wants us to know and believe so that we
may have eternal life and glorify his name.
The Bible’s only account of Jesus’ childhood, therefore, doesn’t satisfy our desire to know more
about his youth. But it does teach us some very important lessons about who he is – as well as
giving us some important instruction regarding the third and fourth commandments. Let us
consider some of these things, under the theme: The Account of the 12-Year-Old Jesus Teaches
Us . . . 1) how to live as a Christian parent. 2) how to live as a Christian child.
Part One: How to live as a Christian Parent.
Right after describing baby Jesus’ presentation at the temple and how his family lived in Nazareth,
Luke writes: Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the Passover.
This first verse already provides an important lesson for Christian parents to consider: the
importance of fostering your own relationship with God.
One of the biggest mistakes parents make is “sending” their children to Sunday school instead of
bringing them. What’s the difference? If you send your children without staying for Bible class
and worship yourself, you are telling your children that Church is for kids – and not adults. You
teach them that their relationship with God is less important than work, leisure, or sports. You
reveal yourself as a hypocrite, because God’s Word clearly says that our relationship with the
LORD is a Christian’s number-one concern.
Now, consider the example of Mary and Joseph. Being so poor and living so far from Jerusalem,
they had a valid excuse not to go to the Passover feast every year.
And yet what does our text say? Every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the Feast of the
Passover. Why did they do this? To remember the great mercy the LORD showed them – saving
their ancestors from Egyptian slavery. As they remembered this past deliverance, they looked
forward to the greater salvation that the coming Lamb of God would provide, whose blood would
atone for the sins of the whole world.
Joseph and Mary took every opportunity to grow in their relationship with the LORD – and so
should you. Why? First of all, because God commands it and you are sinning when you don’t.
But even if that were not enough, think about why God wants you to go to worship, participate in
a Bible class and read his Word at home: it’s to learn more about him and his saving grace towards
you. God wants you to grow in your relationship with him so that you might be strengthened to
resist temptation, find forgiveness when you fall into sin and have hope for facing all the trials of
life.
On top of this, it is only when your own faith has been thus strengthened that you will be able to
pass it on to your children. This is God’s will for you – just as it was for Mary and Joseph. If you
haven’t done this in the past, then repent – confessing your sin to Christ. He will forgive you.
More than that, he will help you grow in your knowledge and zeal for him as you make use of
many the opportunities he offers you to connect with him through his Word and Sacraments.
Let us go back to our text: 42 When [Jesus] was twelve years old, they went up to the Feast,
according to the custom. Whenever a Jewish boy reached the age of 12, he was considered a “son
of the law” and came under all the obligations required of Jewish men. Think of how we view our
children after confirmation, and you will get the gist of this Jewish custom.
43 After the Feast was over, while his parents were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind
in Jerusalem, but they were unaware of it. 44 Thinking he was in their company, they traveled on
for a day.
Now, at first glance we might be thinking: how in the world could Mary and Joseph lose their son
for an entire day? Were they completely incompetent?
That would be very unfair to them – especially if you understood the custom of the time. People
travelled in large caravans of friends and relatives for safety and mutual support. Because some
people naturally walk faster than others, various family groups wouldn’t always be in close 
proximity to one another. This certainly was the case here. Jesus probably had been on this “road”
trip every year of his 12 year old life. We can certainly imagine Mary and Joseph letting him
travel with his friends and relatives – just as we might let our kids ride in Uncle John’s car when
we go on an extended family outing. Mary and Joseph simply assumed that Jesus was with them
– and there was no reason not to - until they reached camp and began looking for him among their
relatives and friends.
We can just imagine the shock Mary and Joseph had when they couldn’t find their son. Their
unintentional negligence led them to lose Jesus.
And here is another life lesson for every Christian to take to heart: don’t travel through life –
merely assuming Christ is with you. Make sure that he is! And how do we check to see if Christ
is with us? By examining our hearts in the light of God’s Law and Gospel.
Take some time with the 10 Commandments – considering how you have broken them. Do your
sins bother you, and if not, why not? Are you truly sorry for all the evil you have thought, spoken
or done? Do you trust that Jesus is your Savior, who has lived a perfect life in your place, died for
all your sins, and rose again so you can live with him forever in heaven? Do you believe that He
forgives all your sins? Do you desire, in the peace of God’s forgiveness, to live a new life to the
glory of God the Father?
Use these questions every day to make sure you haven’t left Jesus somewhere on your life’s
journey. And if you find him missing, go look for him in the only place where he lets himself be
found: his Word.
Part Two: how to live as a Christian child.
Back to Mary and Joseph. We read: 45 When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem
to look for him. 46 After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers,
listening to them and asking them questions.
Notice that the Bible does not describe young Jesus teaching priests, as many pictures often portray
him doing. He was, rather, asking questions and engaging in discussion in order to learn. You see
then that Jesus, as man, had to study – just like we do!
47 Everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers. This is not to say
that young Jesus “knew it all”, but that his questions and answers showed remarkable
comprehension and desire to learn. This 12 year old boy from a hick town in Galilee was
discussing theology with Israel’s most learned – showing a keen zeal for the Bible.
Here, dear children, is a lesson for you. Now, I don’t expect you to know as much as young Jesus,
but I do pray that you share His desire to learn. Why do you think Jesus wanted to know more and
more about the Bible? It’s because it connected him with His heavenly Father – reminding him of
God’s promises and love.
No, you aren’t Jesus, but – through Baptism – you are a dear child of God. Let this fact lead you
to want to learn more about your heavenly Father. Feel free to ask your parents, Sunday school
teachers, and pastor, all the questions you have about God. We may not be able to answer them
all for you, but we will be more than happy to share what God reveals to us in his Word, that you
may grow in faith and love towards your LORD.
48 When his parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, ""Son, why have you
treated us like this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for you."" 49 ""Why were you
searching for me?"" he asked. ""Didn't you know I had to be in my Father's house?""
Jesus' answer is far more than just telling his folks that he was where they left them. A more literal
translation of Jesus’ words would be: “Did you not know that it is necessary for me to be in the
things of my Father? In other words Jesus is saying: “Dear earthly mother and father, you need
not worry about me. I am here, in my Father’s temple. All the objects and events happening here
point to me and my work. I am here learning and confessing God’s Word – which is my true
Father’s will for me. Remember: I am his special Son, sent here on a mission to accomplish His
will. This is where you will always find me.”
50 But they did not understand what he was saying to them. Being with Jesus for so long - clothing,
feeding and teaching him - made them forget that their child was God’s Son, the promised Messiah,
who would save mankind from its bondage to sin, death and the power of the devil. Yes, it was
necessary for Jesus to be in His Father’s house, doing all the things his Father had planned for him.
51 Then he went down to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. But his mother treasured
all these things in her heart. 52 And Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and
men.
And here we have Jesus' childhood and adolescence summarized in a nutshell. We don’t have all
the information we want, but we do have the information we need. And this it is enough for us to
draw yet another lesson.
Children: notice how your Savior embraced his childhood. He, who knows all, went to school in
order to learn. He studied hard. He listened to his parents – submitting to them in everything. He
did not lash out in anger when he felt they were being unfair, but tolerated everything with a
forgiving heart. Jesus respected his earthly father and mother as much as he respected his heavenly
Father – understanding that they were his representatives, given to care for him and protect him.
Children, learn from Jesus' example and be obedient to your parents – for this is good and pleases
the LORD. Recognize how God provides for you through their service. Pray for them and love
them – even if they do wrong.
Brothers and sisters in Christ – even though the account of Jesus' youth is short, there are still more
lessons to learn than we have time for in this sermon. For today, however, I hope you saw how
this account encourages Christian parents and children to be zealous for God’s Word. May we be
led to repent of all the times we have been less than zealous for the Gospel; and rejoice in the fact
that Jesus’ perfect zeal for His Father saves us from our sins. 
This is the primary reason God had this account of Jesus’ youth recorded in Scripture: to show
how Jesus, even from his youth, fulfilled God’s law by keeping his commandments in our place.
May this truth move us to love him all the more – ever recognizing him as God’s Son and our
Savior. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",1/3/2016,
"I don’t know about you, but whenever I start a new year, new plans and worries fill my mind. My plans
deal with all the things I would like to accomplish – both personally and professionally. My worries mostly
stem from the ever increasing moral decay of our society. What spiritual challenges will we face in the
new year? Will we have the strength to overcome them?
As our minds fill with plans and worries, how important and comforting it is to hear our devotion text for
this evening. It contains both a promise and a warning that we would do well to meditate on – not just this
evening, but throughout the year.
Let us, therefore, consider how the warning and promise God gave king Asaph applies to us, under the
theme: God’s covenant: 1) With King Asa 2) With You
Part One: God’s covenant with Asa
Before we dig into our text, I want to talk about King Asa and the important events leading up to it. Asa
was the great grandson of King Solomon. Now, whenever we hear of King Solomon, we think of the
Sunday School stories we learned about him: how God gave him more wisdom than anyone who has ever
lived, the great temple he built for the LORD and the peace and prosperity of his reign.
What you might not know, however, is that Solomon – later on in his life – let his many wives lead him
into idolatry. He built temples and altars to foreign gods – and his people started worshiping them. If it
were not for God’s promise to David, the LORD probably would have taken the kingdom away from
Solomon. Instead, he allowed it to split under the reign of his son Rehoboam.
The Bible records that Rehoboam did nothing to stop the idolatry his father allowed and neither did his son
Abijah. God’s people continued forsaking him, so the LORD removed his protective hand from them –
allowing the King of Egypt to come all the way up to Jerusalem. He carried away many of the golden
treasures King Solomon had made for both the temple and his palace.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: already here we see God doing exactly what He warned he would do in our
devotion text: if you forsake Him, He will forsake you. Consider all the wonderful blessing the Jews had:
they were God’s chosen people, a holy nation, a royal priesthood, a people belonging to God. And yet they
traded all this so that they could be more like their neighbors, worshipping the gods they worshiped. They
forsook the LORD, so the LORD forsook them - demonstrating how, without his protection, they would be
lost, distressed and assimilated into the hopelessness of the world.
Take warning from this, brothers and sisters in Christ. Yes, the LORD is loving and forgiving, but he is
also holy and just. “Do not be deceived,” the Scriptures say, “God is not mocked; for whatever a man
sows, this he will also reap.” (Gal 6:7 NASB). The LORD will not allow his grace to be used as a license
for sin. 
Thankfully the LORD did not abandon his people completely. He remembered his promise to David, and
allowed Asa, the son of Abijah, to become king. The Bible describes his reign in this way: Asa did good
and right in the sight of the LORD his God, 3
for he removed the foreign altars and high places, tore down
the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherim, 4
and commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers
and to observe the law and the commandment. 5 He also removed the high places and the incense altars
from all the cities of Judah. (2Ch 14:2-5 NASB)
Even though previous kings had forsaken the LORD, Asa sought the LORD with his whole heart. And
guess what happened? The LORD allowed himself to be found! He was happy with Asa – using him to
reform the ways of his people
But that doesn’t mean that everything was smooth sailing for Asa. No, one of the first things the LORD
did is put Asa’s faith to the test – to see if He would trust him with his whole heart and, through that faith,
lead the people of Judah back to their God.
Here’s the situation: an army composed of 1 million soldiers marched against Judah - that’s far more than
the 300,000 soldiers Asa had and they were far better equipped as well. What would Asa do? Try to make
a treaty with them or the godless nations around them? No, Asa went out to meet them – demonstrating his
confidence in the LORD’s care and protection. Listen to his “prebattle” prayer: ""LORD, there is no one
besides You to help in the battle between the powerful and those who have no strength; so help us, O LORD
our God, for we trust in You, and in Your name have come against this multitude. O LORD, You are our
God; let not man prevail against You."" 12 So the LORD routed the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah,
and the Ethiopians fled. (2Ch 14:11-12 NASB)
It was right after this great victory that the LORD sent the prophet Azariah to encourage Asa with the words
of our text: ""Listen to me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: the LORD is with you when you are with Him.
And if you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you forsake Him, He will forsake you.”
The Bible tells us that this warning and promise encouraged Asa. He worked all the harder at removing the
idolatry his forefathers allowed. He led Judah to enter into a new covenant with the LORD in which they
promised to seek the LORD with all their heart and soul. And guess what happened? The LORD blessed
his reign with peace.
Part Two: God’s covenant with you.
Now, many of you might be wondering what all this history has to do with us as we face a new year. The
answer is: much, because the promise God gave Asa, he has also given us.
Just as the LORD graciously chose Israel to be his people, so also the LORD has graciously chosen us –
washing us clean from all sin and marking us as his own through the waters of Baptism. St. Peter describes
us in this way: But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God,
that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. 10 Once
you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you
have received mercy. (1Pe 2:9-10 NIV84)
Throughout Scripture the refrain is repeated again and again: God is with us. He is with every believer –
having called, gathered and enlightened us through his means of grace. We are the LORD’s people every
bit as much as Israel and Judah of old. The LORD has given us His Word and sacraments as a way to grow 
in our knowledge and faith in Him. We don’t have to be afraid of anything. The Lord is with us – forgiving
our sin and entrusting us with the privilege of witnessing his saving name to all the earth.
If God is with us, let us then remain with him because, as our sermon text states: The LORD is with you
when you are with Him. How are we to understand these words? Does God mean to say that he is only
with us if we come to him first? No, that can’t be the case for two reasons: 1) The Bible is clear that we
could never come to God or believe in him on our own – because we, by nature, are so utterly corrupt and
helpless. 2) The Bible is also clear that, just as the LORD chose Israel when they sought him not, so also
the LORD has graciously chosen us to be his own people – even when we were lost in sin.
Well, then, how are we to understand our text? I think my little Emily can serve as a good example.
When we walk together in a crowded shop, I ask her to hold my hand so that I can guide her and keep her
safe. She willingly does this but, after a while, she gets antsy. She sees things that grab her attention and
soon pursues them – and, in so doing, leaves my protective presence.
We are all like this, aren’t we? God the Father tells us to stay close to him, and at first we are willing to do
so – holding on tightly to him through our use of His Word and Sacraments. But then, something in the
world grabs our attention. We become enamored with it – all but forgetting our heavenly Father’s words
to stay close to him. Soon we find ourselves pursuing those things and – without actually realizing it –
leaving the presence of our heavenly Father. This is what happened in Judah in later days of Solomon and
Rehoboam; and it can just as easily happen to us!
This is why the LORD encourages us to remain in his presence – listening to his warnings and relying on
his promises. He will protect us from all the great enemies that threaten us – just as he protected Judah
from the million-man army that threatened them. He will help us navigate through the moral decay that is
affecting our country as many more people turn away from him to pursue the gods of this world. As we
put our hand of faith in his, we are assured that He will safely guide us through an uncertain future – safely
delivering us home to himself in heaven.
But, what if we have let go of him? What if we, like a child in a crowded mall, ran away from our Father
and have just come to realize that we are apart from him and lost?
Well, don’t be like Judah, who continued to run away from him. Instead, repent of your sin and turn back
to him, for our sermon text promises if you seek Him, He will let you find Him.
God does not hide himself from those who seek him. No, he is constantly calling us to meet him in the
place where He can always be found. And where is that? In His Word and Sacraments. It is through these
means that God promises to come into contact with us. More than that, He promises to live in and with us
as we use these means of Grace to grow in our knowledge and faith of him. He is with us - allowing himself
to be found in His Word. And, as we remain with Him, God promises to bless us – just as he blessed Asa.
As we submit our plans to him, he will guide them to bring glory to his name. He will also protect us from
the world – ever moving us to reform our hearts in His Gospel so that we may continue to pursue him with
our whole heart and soul.
And so, dear brothers and sisters in Christ, as you enter into a new year, remember the warning and promise
God made with you in Christ. Let it be your guide – not only through this coming year, but your entire life:
The LORD is with you when you are with Him. And if you seek Him, He will let you find Him; but if you
forsake Him, He will forsake you.
And so we pray: “Dear Jesus, send me your Spirit that I may never forsake you. Keep me in grace by
keeping me in your Word that I might always remain with you and you remain with me – under your
protective care and glorifying your name. Amen”",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/31/2015,
"God the Father protects His Child
1) From the direct raging of Hell.
2) From the indirect dangers of the world.
13 After they had departed, suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. He
said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, because
Herod will search for the child in order to kill him.” 14 He got up, took the child and his mother
during the night, and departed for Egypt. 15 He stayed there until the death of Herod. This
happened to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, “Out of Egypt I called my
son.” 16 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, he was furious. He
issued orders to kill all the boys who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding countryside,
from two years old and under, in keeping with the exact time which he had learned from the wise
men.
17 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: 18 A voice was heard
in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and she refused to be
comforted, because they are no more. 19 After Herod had died, an angel of the Lord suddenly
appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, 20 “Get up, take the child and his mother and
go to the land of Israel, since those who were trying to kill the child have died.” 21 He got up and
took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. 22 But when he heard that
Archelaus, Herod’s son, had succeeded his father as ruler in Judea, he was afraid to go there.
Since he had been warned in a dream, he departed for the region of Galilee. 23 He arrived and
settled in a city called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets would be
fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
A couple of days ago we celebrated Christmas - recalling the joy our Savior's birth gave Mary,
Joseph, the shepherds and us.
But not everyone was happy about Jesus' birth. Satan certainly wasn't. The Messiah's arrival
meant that his days were numbered. This is why he wasted no time allying himself with paranoid
Herod to kill Jesus while he was still a defenseless baby.
But, knowing what the devil was planning, the LORD kept his Son safe from all harm so that he
could accomplish his mission of saving us. Let us learn how God the Father protected His
Child 1) from the direct raging of Hell, and 2) from the indirect dangers of the world.
Part 1: From the direct raging of hell.
When people think about Bethlehem, they often imagine a peaceful small town. It may well have
been, but don't let that picture fool you.
Overlooking the little town, off in the distance, stood a palace of king Herod. He was a ruthless
tyrant who killed many innocent people in order to ensure his reign - including his beloved wife
and some of his sons. Judea may have been at peace when Christ was born, but it wasn’t the
peace that comes from freedom.
Now you can understand why the people of Judea were disturbed when the magi came looking
for a newborn king. They were terrified as to how Herod would react.
Herod had a secret plan to kill the child. He told the magi to report back to him once they found
the new born king so that he could worship him. The LORD, however, warned the magi of
Herod's plan so they could avoid him by returning home via another route.
What Herod and Satan failed to do through trickery, they would now attempt through utter
brutality. God the Father knew this, so He sent an angel, who appeared to Joseph in a dream. He
said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, because
Herod will search for the child in order to kill him.” 14 He got up, took the child and his mother
during the night, and departed for Egypt. 15 He stayed there until the death of Herod. This
happened to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, “Out of Egypt I called my
son.”
Take note of the special way God protected Jesus: He could have sent a legion of angels to
swoop the baby up and carry him to safety, but he didn't. Instead, God simply let Joseph fulfill
his duty as foster-father - entrusting a mere man to protect His only-begotten Son!
This is certainly amazing, but it shouldn't shock us. Every father just needs to look at his own
child to consider the responsibility with which God has blessed him. Joseph stands as an example
for us all, for every Christian father watches over one or more of God's precious children. And,
even though little is said of Joseph in Scripture, everything that is said is powerful, and provides
enough of an example for a Christian man to follow for a lifetime – especially when it comes to
Christian education! I will, however, save that all for another day and simply say this: Joseph
believed God and this faith - expressing itself in immediate action - saved his family.
Our text continues: 16 When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, he was
furious. He issued orders to kill all the boys who were in Bethlehem and in all the surrounding
countryside, from two years old and under, in keeping with the exact time which he had learned
from the wise men. 17 Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: 18 A
voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and
she refused to be comforted, because they are no more.
What a terrifying scene: Children torn from their mothers and killed with no time to say goodbye.
Yes, hell itself was raging against the Christ Child. No slaughter was too great to
accomplish its destruction.
We should note, however, that Bethlehem was a very small village. Most historians and
theologians estimate that ""only"" 15-30 children died in this atrocity. But that doesn’t make this
slaughter any less horrible than if thousands had died. And if God was so moved to record this 
event when “only” 15-30 babies were killed, I can’t even begin to imagine how guilty he must
hold our society, when, through abortion, it allows the murder of millions of unborn each year.
Hell raged against God's Son, but the LORD kept him safe. We certainly thank God for that!
""But what about the other children? Why didn't God save them from the hand of Herod?"" I
would be lying if I told you that I knew the answer. There are things that God just keeps hidden
from us. But God does promise to work in all things for the good of those who love him - and
this is certainly the case here. Think of it this way: if God had not kept his Son safe, then our
hope of salvation would have been lost with him. God saved all of us when he saved his Son.
'But what about the other children?"" Again, Scripture does not tell us why the LORD allows the
things he does - that question we have to leave unanswered. HOWEVER, the LORD does offer
us some hope. The Bible says: The righteous perish, and no one ponders it in his heart; devout
men are taken away, and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared
from evil. Those who walk uprightly enter into peace; they find rest as they lie in death. (Isaiah
57:1,2 NIV84)
Let's apply these words to the children of Bethlehem. We can assume that most (if not all) of
those martyred children belonged to Jewish parents. The Old Testament Scriptures commanded
parents pass their faith on to their children. All the children in whom the Holy Spirit had
awakened faith died as believers - and as such, they died righteous. The LORD, therefore, turned
this horrible atrocity into a blessing for them - ushering the believing children to his side in
heaven, where they are at peace and rest. No evil can ever reach them there.
Parents, learn from this account! If you care for your children, bring them up in the way of the
LORD - starting the very day they are born. Tell them about Jesus, read, sing and pray God’s
Word with them and bring them to be baptized. The Holy Spirit will work through these means
and awaken faith in the heart of your child. Then you can be sure that, even if some illness,
crime, terror or disaster takes your child away from you, the LORD has not allowed your child to
be taken away from him. That child will be at rest, enjoying the company of his heavenly Father.
You can be sure that you will see him again, alive and very well, when Christ comes again on the
last day.
If, however, you neglect this responsibility – then I can offer no certain assurances as what
becomes of your child because, as the Bible says, faith comes from hearing the message, and the
message is heard though the word of Christ. Parents, learn from this account!
Part 2: From the indirect dangers of the world.
Oh, how foolish Herod was. He thought He had won. He thought He could keep his throne
forever. But all his raging was for nothing. God kept his child safe. And Herod. . . well, he died!
Our sermon text continues: 19 After Herod had died, an angel of the Lord suddenly appeared in a
dream to Joseph in Egypt and said, 20 “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land 
of Israel, since those who were trying to kill the child have died.” 21 He got up and took the
child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. 22 But when he heard that Archelaus,
Herod’s son, had succeeded his father as ruler in Judea, he was afraid to go there.
History records that Archelaus was as brutal as his father - starting his reign by slaughtering
3000 innocent people in the temple just to get at a few conspirators who were mixed into the
crowd! This was the news that greeted Joseph upon his return to Judea and it filled him with
fear.
Since he had been warned in a dream, he departed for the region of Galilee. 23 He arrived and
settled in a city called Nazareth, so that what had been spoken through the prophets would be
fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
Even though Herod was dead, and no one was specifically trying to kill Jesus, Judea was filled
with indirect dangers that threatened God's Son. This is why the Lord advised Joseph to move to
Galilee - to Nazareth, the city Mary and Joseph had lived in before Jesus birth.
Because of all the Gentiles who lived in that area, the Judean Jews viewed the Galileans as
uneducated, uncultured and ""impure"" compared to them. But, just as Kewaunee is far safer than
Milwaukee, so also Nazareth was safer than Jerusalem - far from Archelaus and all the political
strife surrounding his rule.
It is wonderful to see how God’s purposes always prevail: how he saved his dear child from the
direct raging of hell itself and from all the indirect dangers of the world. We can take comfort in
this, because whatever God did to protect His Son Jesus, He will also do for us, his adopted
children through baptism.
Just as Satan and the world raged against Christ, so they also rage against us - wanting nothing
less than our destruction. But, just as God guided history for his Son, He also directs history for
us - protecting us in so many different ways. Sometimes we perceive it; many times we don't.
However, the LORD is, nevertheless, always watching over us.
If we lose our life or suffer the loss of a loved one - as happened to many in Bethlehem - even
then we can take comfort in our victory over Satan. Why? Because God promises to use all
things - even illness, crime and terror - for our eternal good. What an awesome comfort it is to
know that God is in control. We don't have to be afraid of terrorists like ISIS. We don't have to
be afraid of illness or horrible natural disasters. No matter what happens to us, we can have this
confidence: God is with us and will help us through. He will turn every evil around for our
good. He promises to do this because he is our dear, heavenly Father who loves us. If God is for
us, who can be against us? What can mere people do to us? They may be able to hurt or kill our
bodies, but they cannot kill our souls. Rejoice, therefore in God’s promise to protect his holy
children through faith – understanding that nothing can separate us from His love, which is
shown to us through the person and work of Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/27/2015,
"One of the joys of Christmas is singing all the beautiful carols of the season. And there are so many of
them!
Think about the Christmas songs you like: what are they about? I know: this might seem like a silly
question, but there are a lot of different Christmas songs about a lot of different things - ranging from Santa
and snow to songs about Christ and his birth.
Even songs about Jesus are not all the same. Some seem to exclusively describe the nativity with very little
mention of why Jesus’ birth was important. Other famous carols seem to exclusively talk about the gifts we
should bring baby Jesus. And then there are those hymns that speak about the spiritual meaning of Jesus’
birth.
It is certainly important to sing on Christmas, but even more important than that is the choice of songs we
sing. Let us consider this truth, under the theme: Celebrate a Better Christmas with a Better Christmas
Song.
Our Psalm begins: Sing
What does the Bible mean when it calls Christians to sing? At first glance this might seem like a dumb
question, but it really isn’t. You see, the singing Scripture encourages means more than just carrying a tune.
It is akin, rather, to telling a story - proclaiming the marvelous things God has done!
Songs have a way of communicating that mere story telling can’t accomplish. Music stirs the emotions.
For example, who doesn’t get excited singing “Joy to the World,” or feel at peace when singing “Silent
Night.” Music communicates those feelings in a way that words cannot.
God doesn’t just want us to read His Gospel as if we were reading a newspaper about world events –
detached from the story. No, he wants His Gospel to take hold off our emotions, intellect and will. This is
why he uses the word “sing.”
Sing to the LORD a new song.
What is the song God wants us to sing and why is it called new? Replace the word “song” with “religion”
or “theology” and you will soon understand.
The “old song” is the theology of natural, fallen man who thinks that he can earn God’s love and salvation
through his own works. The “lyrics” of the old song are very familiar. They go like this: “Always do what
feels right to you. It’s up to you to get right with God. How can you expect God to love you if you don’t
love him first? Just live a good life and you too will get to heaven.”
Other than true, biblical Christianity, every religion and non-religion in this world is a variation of the same
old song: “Do good and you will be fine.” The problem with this theology is that it is simply not true.
God’s law does not ask us to try hard, it demands perfection. And can any of us be perfect? Consider the
words of Scripture: whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all
of it.i
 And again, “If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.”
ii
You see, then, the “old song” of praising man’s ability to earn favor with God is a wretched song –
regardless of how attractive the melody is to the human heart. Singing this song either leaves us puffed up
in arrogance, or in the depths of despair because of our total inability to live the perfect life God’s law
demands of us. It always directs us away from our salvation and ultimately leads us to hell.
This is why the LORD encourages us to sing a new song. What is this song and why is it called new? The
very next words of our text explains that this song is the story of the marvelous things God did to save us.
It is called new because mankind can’t know what God did unless He himself explains it.
Think of the nativity, for example. When the world looks at a manger scene, all it sees is a poor mother,
father and baby surrounded by animals. They should be pitied. God’s Word, however, reveals there is
much more to the scene than what the human eye can see. There, wrapped in swaddling clothes and laying
in a bed of hay, is the almighty Son of God who has been born to die on the cross for our sins. We can‘t
know this unless God reveals it to us and this is exactly why our song is called new.
Yes, sing to the LORD a new song, that is joyfully live your life to the glory of God – proclaiming through
your words, actions and attitude the marvelous things God has done.
And what has he done? His right hand and his holy arm have worked salvation for him.
When the Bible speaks of God’s hand or arm, it mostly refers to God’s powerful intervention to save his
people. The prophet Isaiah once wrote that when God saw how steeped in sin mankind was, that no truth,
justice or righteousness could be found on this earth, he was appalled that there was no one to intervene;
so his own arm worked salvation for him, and his own righteousness sustained him.iii
In other words, because mankind couldn’t save itself, God did it for us. And how did He do it? With his
own holy arm of Jesus! He is the one God sent to intervene on our behalf – working out our salvation by
living the life of perfect obedience to God’s law that we all failed to live, by suffering and dying in payment
for our sins, and by rising from the dead – proving beyond any shadow of a doubt that He has reconciled
us to the Father. Our sins need no longer stand against us. Through faith in him we are at peace with the
LORD.
This is the salvation Jesus worked out to the glory of God's saving name. He has broken the devil’s power
over us. Through faith, we belong to him.
Our psalm continues: The LORD has made his salvation known and revealed his righteousness to the
nations. Jesus wasn’t just born into this world as the Savior of the Jews. No, the heavenly angels told the
shepherds that the birth of Jesus is good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.iv

The songs the angels sang, Simeon’s prophecy over baby Jesus at the temple, the worship of the magi – all
these things reveal baby Jesus as the one who would bring true righteousness and salvation to every tribe,
people, language and nation on this earth. Jesus is our “universal Savior” – who continues to make himself
known in the world through the preaching of the Gospel.
And what does the Gospel say about Him? That He has remembered his love and his faithfulness to the
house of Israel.
When God called Abraham to faith, he made him a promise: that through a special descendant of his all
nations would be blessed. And, in spite of the depravity of man, the perverse nature of his people and their
rebellious ways, the LORD never forgot his covenant with Abraham. Throughout the centuries He patiently
and repeatedly called his people to repentance - lovingly reminding them of his promise until the time came
for Jesus to be born.
And when the time had fully come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under law, to redeem those
under law, that we might receive the full rights of sons.v
 “That we might receive the full rights of sons?
Sons of whom?” someone might ask. Sons of God; as the Scriptures say: How great is the love the Father
has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And (because of the salvation God sent His
Son to accomplish) that is what we are!vi
Our psalm continues: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. That is to say: God so
desires all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truthvii that he commissioned us to share the
good news of Jesus with every one we can. He considers the worldwide spread of the Gospel as so important
that he already calls it as a done deal.
And how does the Gospel spread? Through our singing of this new song – that is to say, through our joyful
sharing of God’s holy Gospel, as the Scriptures say: ""Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be
saved."" How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one
of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? . . . As it is
written, ""How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!""viii
And so, dear brothers and sisters in Christ, God wants you to celebrate a better Christmas by singing a better
Christmas song. Don’t worry – all you non-singers – this does not mean actually carrying a tune. Rather,
it means that we rejoice in the Christmas Gospel so much ourselves that our confession of it will be “song
like” in the ears of others.
But how can we attain such joy in the Gospel that our words and actions become a song before the world?
We get it by basking in the Gospel ourselves – not just by coming to Church on Christmas and Easter, but
every Sunday of the year. The more we, by meditating on God’s Law, realize our need for a Savior, the
greater we will appreciate him. Not only that, but the more we study the Gospel, the more we will stand in
awe of what lengths the LORD went to in order to save us. Through constant contact with the Means of
Grace, the Holy Spirit strengthens both your faith and love for him to such a degree that you can’t help but
be like the Shepherds who, after seeing the Savior, spread the word concerning what had been told them
about this child. . . glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just
as they had been told.

Today is Christmas: the day our God was born as a human baby in order to enter our story to win our
salvation. Celebrate a better Christmas by singing the better Christmas song of the marvelous things God
has done for you in Christ. May the LORD grant that your words and actions loudly proclaim this song
among your family, friends and neighbors so that they don’t remain stuck – singing the same old tune of
trying to save themselves, but learn to rejoice with you in everything the LORD has done for them. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/25/2015,
"What makes a Christmas gift great? Is it its usefulness? Is it the forethought that went into the gift? How
about the cost?
Could you imagine receiving a present that combines all three of those attributes? What kind of gift would
it be? An Xbox? A Car? A vacation? A new dress?
Who would you expect to give you such a present? Your parents? Your children? Your spouse?
This evening we are going to talk about a far greater gift than anything we can imagine: one that truly says,
“I know and love you with my whole heart. I want to spend eternity with you.” No, this is not the gift of
an engagement ring given by a fiancé. It is the gift of a Savior, given by our loving God.
Let us learn to celebrate a Better Christmas with a Better Christmas gift: the gift of Jesus Christ. He
is: 1) A gift we need 2) A gift given with greatest forethought. 3) An unimaginably costly gift
Part One: A gift we need.
The best gifts are often practical – things we really need. Not only are they great to have, but they reveal
that the giver knows us well and cares about us.
Jesus is the most useful and needful gift imaginable.
You might be thinking, “How can a baby born over 2000 years ago be something I need today?” To explain
that, let me introduce you to the word “sin”.
God created Adam and Eve perfect and holy. Sadly, all that changed one day when they disobeyed Him by
doing the very thing He commanded them not to do. Ever since that day “sin” infected man’s heart. What
is sin? It is man’s desire and will to do the opposite of what the LORD commands. It is breaking God’s
holy law which can be summarized by the word “love.”
“Sin” is the reason there is so much crime, terror and evil on this earth. Because of sin there is death.
Because of sin we deserve hell.
God is completely sinless. His holy nature cannot tolerate even the slightest speck of sin in his presence.
Since we are anything but sinless, the question becomes: how do we get rid of our sin so we can be united
with God? The answer is: we can’t. And why not? Because, ever since sin entered the world, we can
never be perfect.
But God could do something about our situation! This is why He sent His Son to be born into this world
so that He could live, die and rise again in order to pay for our sins in full.
The whole point of Christmas can be summarized in this verse: God so loved the world that he gave his one
and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.
What practical value does God’s gift of Jesus have for my day-to-day life? Much! If Jesus, the very Son
of God, suffered and died in order to pay for my sins, then they are most certainly gone: paid for in full.
Through faith in Jesus, I can live at peace with God – unafraid of Him and rejoicing in His great love for
me.
Because God gave me Jesus, I know that, when I die, my soul will live on with the LORD in heaven. Not
only is this true, but the Bible also promises that God will raise the dead on the last day, so that every
believer can live with him in the eternal paradise he will create for us when He comes again in glory.
All these truths have a real practical application for my life. They fill me with such hope that they change
the way I live: I no longer focus on myself; rather I focus on serving my God and helping my neighbor in
love. The Gospel of Jesus gives me courage and power to say no to sin. And if I do fall into sin, then the
gift of Jesus gives me the forgiveness I need to remain at peace with God and under his loving care.
Yes, the gift of Jesus is a great gift, a Gift we certainly need every day of our lives.
Part Two: A gift given with greatest forethought
Another mark of a great gift is that it is given out of love with great forethought and planning. I think of
the sweaters my mom used to knit for me, which often took months to get ready.
Consider the forethought God gave your salvation. Ever since Adam and Eve fell into sin God repeated
the promise that His Savior was coming. The Old Testament Scriptures are filled with such promises –
some of which you will hear (or have heard) during the service this evening.
But do you know that these prophecies don’t even scratch the surface of the loving preparations God made?
The LORD is not stupid: even before creation he knew that we would sin and that he would have to give
up His Son in order to save us. And yet, in spite of knowing all the trouble we would cause him, he still
planned out how he would save us.
And, don’t imagine God’s eternal planning merely as “global” in scale – thinking about how he would save
the “mass” of humanity. His planning was also very personal. The Bible says that the LORD thought about
each and every one of us individually as he prepared our salvation. Think about what this means: before
the beginning of the world, you were personally on the mind of God. He loved you so much that, then and
there, He decided to take on human flesh and blood in order to save you.
Part Three: An unimaginably costly gift
And this leads us to my next point: the best Christmas gifts are costly. Now, before anyone gets mad at me
for making such a statement, let me explain that I don’t equate “cost” with “expense” - in the sense that
$1000 gifts are intrinsically better than $10 ones. When I use the word “cost,” I use it in the sense of the
sacrifice a person has to make in order to procure the gift he wants to give.
Let me use an example: Compare a billionaire’s gift of $10,000 to charity to an impoverished person giving
$70 (all the money he earned in one day) to another person in need. When you think about it, the poor
person’s gift cost far more than the billionaire's because of the sacrifice he made.
But neither of these gifts even remotely compare to the sacrifice God made for us: He gave up His one and
only Son! Let that statement sink in, for a moment. There is nothing that God loves more than his Son
and yet, in love for us, God was willing to sacrifice Him so we could be saved.
Parents, could you ever imagine sending your children to be mocked, hurt and killed in order to save a
person like me? Only if you were convinced that I was a person worth saving! But listen to what the Bible
says about God: Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might
possibly dare to die. But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ
died for us. (Romans 5:7-8, NIV84)
Even if someone where able to give the whole universe as a gift, it still would not compare to the costliness
of what God the Father did in giving us His Son. And because God has given us His Son, we can be sure
that he will also provide everything we need for our body and life – graciously watching over us until He
comes to take us home to himself in heaven.
And so, dear friends, I urge you all to celebrate a better Christmas this year by rejoicing in the great gift
God has given you: the gift of his Son. Let the need, forethought and cost of this gift lead you to ever cling
to Jesus in faith. Why? Because God does not want you to live apart from him and end up in hell. The
LORD truly loves you. He wants you to spend eternity with Him in heaven. The birth of Jesus proves this
fact beyond any shadow of a doubt.
Turn to Christ, then, in repentance and faith in order to receive this great gift of God’s Son. Treasure Him
your whole life and then, at its end, you will experience the full glory of God’s love for you in Christ. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/24/2015,
"What are your hopes for Christmas?
I often catch my children looking at the gifts under our tree – hoping they are the toys they want for
Christmas. I know people who are hoping for snow. Some people hope to see their family over the
holidays. Others hope that God simply keeps their loved ones safe. Many lonely people hope to find a
friend. The homeless hope to find some place warm and the poor a good meal to eat. The depressed are
hoping for compassion and relief. And who doesn’t hope for deliverance from all the terror, crime and
everything else that is happening in our world.
Yes, people have a lot of hope at Christmas. Sometimes these hopes become a reality. Many times they
do not. But there is one that I have yet to mention – one that God desires all of us to have. It is a certain
hope that sustains the Christian throughout his life on earth. It is a hope that brings him to heaven. Let us
consider what it is, under the theme: Celebrate a better Christmas with a Better Christmas Hope. 1)
God has promised to send his Salvation. 2) Let us wait for it in faith.
Part One: God has promised to send his Salvation
I don’t know about you but with all the news of terror, crime and everything else going on in our world, I
have been really looking forward to Christmas. Why? That’s a good question. At first glance it might
seem to be a form of escapism: just wanting to get away from all the bad news by occupying my mind
with cheerful music, beautiful decorations, and happy thoughts of peace, love, hope and joy. And isn’t it
nice to think about these things instead of all the other stuff going on around us?
Yes, it is nice to escape all the problems of the world at Christmas, but if this is the main reason we look
forward to the holiday, then we are no better than a drug addict looking forward to his next fix to escape
the realities of life! Why do I say that? Because of all the gifts, lights, trees, pretty music and happy
thoughts – none of these things actually help. The problems still remain.
Then why should we look forward to celebrating the holidays? Because the message of Christmas offers
me hope – not the false hope in the supposed good will of man, but the real hope that God is merciful –
willing to forgive all our sins. It is the hope that God loves us and will deliver all who believe to himself
in heaven where we will live in perfect peace, harmony, love and joy with God for all eternity.
But how can we be sure of this? Sometimes our life takes such a turn that it seems as if God has
abandoned us. Think about the Christians in the Middle East that are being persecuted by ISIS. How
about San Bernardino? How about our own lives? Maybe we struggle with depression this holiday
season because a loved one is sick or dying. Maybe we are facing financial troubles, relationship 
problems, or some sin is weighing heavy on our souls. Maybe the infamous “Christmas blues” have us
down. We don’t “feel” our Savior’s presence and, on top of this, the world claims that He doesn’t even
exist. Is our belief in Jesus just a crutch to get us through life? Where is he and when will He keep his
promise to come and deliver us? Is our hope in vain?
No, it’s not in vain – and Christmas proves it!
Consider our sermon text, which was written for a time of great distress. God’s Old Testament people
were about to go into captivity for their idolatries and unbelief. To understand their situation, imagine
ISIS not just terrorizing our country, but taking it over. Imagine them destroying this Church before your
very eyes and taking you as slaves to the Middle East. This was the kind of hopeless distress the
recipients of our sermon text faced when Babylon conquered Jerusalem, destroyed the temple and took
the Jews into captivity. It would seem as if God had abandoned them.
Did he? No, he didn’t. It is true that God’s people were being severely disciplined for their sin. But it
was for a purpose: that they might repent of their idolatries and cling to him in faith. God would not leave
them in their captivity. He would rescue them – judging the nations that oppressed them, as the LORD
explicitly states in our sermon text: My righteousness is near, My salvation has gone forth, And My arms
will judge the peoples.
Oh, what joy and hope this promise brought God’s people trapped in captivity! The LORD would rescue
them from Babylon. But, what is more important is what this rescue would symbolize: how God would
deliver all believers from their slavery to sin.
You see, ever since Adam and Eve disobeyed God, mankind has been held captive to sin, death and the
power of the devil. This is why there is so much crime, terror and evil on this earth. Sin permeates the
human nature. We are at odds with God – separated from him with no hope of saving ourselves. Our
situation is certainly desperate – and that’s why God decided to do something about it.
Yes, the LORD loves us so much that, right after Adam and Eve fell into sin, He gave a promise: He
would send a special son – one who would be both God and man – who would defeat the devil and rescue
us from our spiritual captivity to sin. And how would he accomplish this? By being born under the law,
living the perfect life we all failed to live and dying in payment for our sins.
For thousands of years, God repeated his promise to send a Savior, and people look forward to it. But, as
time progressed, many became impatient tempted to give up on their hope. Would the Messiah actually
come? God said that his salvation is near, but where is it? He has been silent for so many years.
But then it happened. A special star appeared, angels spoke with men and the glory of the LORD
appeared in the sky over the fields of Bethlehem. God has kept his promise: his salvation and
righteousness had come – all wrapped up in swaddling clothes and laid in a manger. The Savior was born
to defeat our enemies and free us from our captivity. And this is exactly what Jesus accomplished
through his life, death and resurrection for us – promising before he ascended into heaven that He will
come back to judge the nations in order to deliver us home to himself in heaven.
You see then, brothers and sisters in Christ, that Christmas is not just some feel good holiday meant to
distract us from all the problems in the world. The message of Christmas is a message of real hope. God
has sent his salvation into the world. He has won our forgiveness and is coming again soon to raise the
dead, so that we can live with him forever in paradise. And because Christmas offers us such real hope,
we respond by waiting for it in faith.
Part Two: Waiting for it in faith.
Remember how I said that our sermon text was written to comfort the Jews held captive in Babylon.
Well, that was a little bit of an oversimplification. Our specific sermon text was actually written to use
the context of the Babylonian captivity to give us (New Testament Christians) hope as we wait for Jesus
to deliver us from this evil earth. This is clearly seen in what God says at the end our verse: The
coastlands will wait for Me, And for My arm they will wait expectantly.
The coastlands are the nations beyond Israel. It includes believers from all around the world. It includes
you and me. Everyone who received God’s promise of salvation with repentance and faith is a child of
God, who eagerly waits for the LORD to fulfill what He promised – and Christmas strengthens that trust.
Yes, Christmas is not about celebrating the human spirit, peace, Santa Claus, or anything else the secular
world attaches to the holiday. It is all about Jesus: celebrating God the Father keeping his promise to
provide a Savior by sending His Son.
And if God did this (which history proves he did) then we can have hope – trusting that God will continue
to keep his promise to rescue us from every evil deed and bring us safely to his heavenly kingdom.
You see, then, that the reason I want to celebrate Christmas is not to escape all the bad stuff that is
happening in this world, but to be strengthened to face it – confident of God’s promise to cause all things
to work together for good as I hold onto him in faith. And why can I have such confidence? Because
Christmas is all about God giving up his Son to be my Savior. And if He did this for me, I can be
confident that I am at peace with Him.
So, brothers and sister in Christ, celebrate a better Christmas with a better Christmas hope. God has come
to rescue his people. Rejoice in the righteousness and salvation he won for you the first time He came
into the world. Look forward to the ultimate deliverance he will give us when He comes again. Let these
thoughts fortify you for all the hardships you face in life, ever leading you to look forward to Christ’s
return, like a child looks forward to Christmas. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/20/2015,
"Christmas dinner! Just the thought of all the feasts I’ve been a part of makes my mouth water. Don’t you
also have found memories of gathering around the Christmas dinner table with family and friends? As a
child: I looked forward to our Christmas dinners as much as I looked forward to my gifts.
But as wonderful as these festive dinners were, they are but imperfect shadows of the greater, spiritual
dinner God the Father offers us at Christmas. Let us consider this truth, under the theme: Celebrate a Better
Christmas Dinner with a better host, better food, and better guests.
Part One: Better Host
Unless you have abusive, unloving parents, I think we would all agree that the best place to eat Christmas
dinner is with our folks. Even the world gets this point, as a viral internet Christmas commercial for the
German store “Edeka” demonstrates.
This commercial begins with an old man at home, adjusting the pictures of his children, listening to his
answering machine. His daughter apologizes for not being able to visit during the holidays. Wishing him
a hardy “Froehliche Weihnacten” (Merry Christmas), her family promisesto visit the next year. The camera
then shows him at the table, eating Christmas dinner alone for three consecutive years.
The scene then changes to his children. They all get a notice that their father has died. Coming from all
corners of the globe, they gather at his house in tears. When they come into the house what do they find,
but the table all set and their father very much alive – telling his children that this was the only way he
could get them together! What follows is a most joyous Christmas dinner of family and fellowship that the
children realized they have missed for so long.
As I mentioned, this video went viral with a lot of people commenting how much they cried watching it.
And why did they cry? Because it rings so true: we often let our “busy-ness” rob us from spending time
with the people who truly matter in our lives. What is even more sad is that our “busy-ness” often prevents
us from enjoying time with our almighty Father in heaven.
You see, like the old man in the commercial I described, God the Father is separated from His children.
Now, unlike the commercial: God is not lonely. He doesn’t “need” our company. However, God the Father
still loves us. We are the crowning jewels of his creation. He doesn’t want us lost in hell because of our
sin. He wants us to be with him, partaking in the wonderful feast of salvation He has prepared for us -
enjoying his presence for eternity. And this is why, through the preaching of Law and Gospel, He invites
us to come home – telling us that He is willing to forgive all our wrongs and, through our repentance and
faith, renew in us a right heart.
But how do we treat his invitation? We are too busy for Bible class, too busy for worship and too busy for
personal devotions. Like the daughter in the commercial, we offer all sort of excuses why we can’t come
– promising to spend time with God in the future. The problem is that, unless something drastic happens,
that time doesn’t come. And, if it does come, how often aren’t we tempted to see worship (which is intended
to be family time with our Father) as merely an obligation we need to fulfill for him instead of a blessing
for us?
Oh how sinfully pathetic we are – chasing after the world’s tinsel when our loving LORD offers us spiritual
gold! There is no better host than God the Father, and there is no better dinner than the food he provides.
Every Christian knows this to be true. Let us then heed his invitation to come to the great banquet he has
prepared for us – a never ending feast of forgiveness, fellowship, and love.
Part Two: Better food
Now understand this: the food the LORD invites us to eat is not some quick and easy dinner that cost him
next to nothing to prepare. No, what he offers is the most nourishing, soul satisfying, and expensive food
there is. All the gold and silver in the universe could not afford it.
What isthisfood? It is he, himself – asJesus once said: 47 I tell you the truth, he who believes has everlasting
life.
48 I am the bread of life.
49 Your forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died.
50 But here is
the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die.
51 I am the living bread that
came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I
will give for the life of the world."" (John 6:47-51, NIV84)
Just as we need healthy food in order to live physically, so also we need Jesus in order to live spiritually.
Without the forgiveness Jesus won for us through the sacrifice of his flesh on the cross, we would all be
condemned to eternal death in hell – hopelessly separated from our Creator forever.
The LORD himself is our spiritual food: we need to eat him in order to live. But how do we eat Jesus
spiritually? Listen again to what Jesus said before he calls himself the bread of Life: I tell you the truth,
he who believes has everlasting life. Through faith we partake of Jesus. And how do we regularly partake
of him? By hearing the Gospel and making use of his Sacraments as St. Paul says: Consequently, faith
comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ. (Romans 10:17,
NIV84).
Even though we need food to live, we don’t just eat it because we have to. We eat it because we want to.
The same is also true regarding that Gospel of Christ: it is not some tasteless nourishment that you have to
force yourself to eat. King David writes: Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who
takes refuge in him.
Faith in the LORD is a wonderful thing! God’s love, the forgiveness of sins, comfort and strength in every
tribulation, help and guidance in life, the sure hope of heaven, . . . all these wonderful flavors are
experienced in the Gospel. Yes, taste (that is, study the Gospel of Christ) and you will see that the LORD
is good. He is so good you will not want to stop learning about him. You will want to come back again
and again to the Gospel - to taste the love that made you a child of the most High God. And if this is who
you are, you can be sure that God the Father will watch over you throughout your earthly life (just as He
did for Jesus) using all the pain and suffering you experience as a blessing. He will protect you, deliver
you and, when Christ comes again, raise and glorify you.
What a wonderful feast the LORD has provided for us: the feast of himself for the forgiveness of sins! Let
us never neglect this wonderful meal which isn’t only offered to us at Christmas but through out the year!
Celebrate a better Christmas dinner, with a better host, better food and, as we will learn next, better guests.
Part Three: Better Guests.
Where would you rather spend Christmas dinner: at home with all your relatives and close friends, or at
Buckingham palace with the royal family and all the world’s most important and influential leaders in
attendance? Now, as I mentioned before: there is no better place to celebrate Christmas dinner than with
your folks. Still, I would love to have the chance to spend Christmas at Buckingham palace as the queen’s
guest! But wouldn’t it be fun if both being with family and royalty at Christmas were an option?
When it comes to the better Christmas dinner to which God the Father invites us, “both” is the only option!
Look around you. What do you see? A beautiful Church, some people you know well and others not so
well gathered to hear about Christ?
I tell you what God sees: his royal family, gathered around his dinner table partaking in the wonderful feast
of forgiveness that He prepared for us in love.
That is right: every believer who has come to Church this morning is royalty: an adopted child of the living
God, a prince or princess of heaven. St. Peter says so much, when he writes: 9 But you are a chosen people,
a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who
called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. (1 Peter 2:9, NIV84)
Forget eating dinner with President Obama, Queen Elizabeth, or Vladimir Putin; when you came to
worship, you came with the most powerful people in the world – people of greater influence than any of
those three. You are worshipping with God’s personal advisors.
Do you think I’m exaggerating? Consider Jesus own words: 12 I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in
me will do what I have been doing. . . .
14 You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it. (John
14:12a,14 NIV84) Consider, also, what St. Paul wrote to the Christians in Corinth: Do you not know that
the saints will judge the world? . . .
3 Do you not know that we will judge angels? (1 Corinthians 6:2a,3a,
NIV84) As you can clearly see: I am not exaggerating.
But it gets better than that: the guests at Jesus’ Gospel feast are not only the most influential people in the
world with God, they are also your closest relatives and friends- closer to you than even your blood relation!
Jesus said about those who believe in him: 48 ""Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?""
49 Pointing
to his disciples, he said, ""Here are my mother and my brothers.
50 For whoever does the will of my Father
in heaven is my brother and sister and mother."" (Matthew 12:48-50, NIV84)
How wonderful it is, then, to be here - celebrating God’s feast with our brothers and sisters in Christ. True:
we don’t always get along. Because we still live on this evil earth, the devil will certainly try to cause
tension and division among us – just like he tries to do among blood relatives. But in Christ we stand
forgiven and empowered to forgive each other.
When the going gets tough, we can go to any Christian for help. Regardless of who they are are, if they
truly believe in Jesus, they will not turn us away, but will listen to our problem, encourage us with the
Gospel and pray on our behalf. They will support with physical necessities, if support is needed. There is
no other person on this earth who understands you, cares for you and loves you more than a fellow brother
or sister in the faith.
True, because of sin this doesn’t happen perfectly. But this is what Christ intended when He called us
together as a congregation of believers, and as such, we prayerfully strive to make this a reality - asking
God to bless us with a spirit of love, patience and forgiveness toward one another.
Brothers and sisters in Christ - regardless of what plans you have for the holidays, don’t neglect celebrating
a better Christmas dinner this year. How? By accepting your Father’s invitation to come into his house,
partake of the spiritual food he has provided for you, and enjoy the fellowship of your closest family - your
fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/13/2015,
"Decorating houses with lights has become a beloved Christmas custom. Who doesn’t enjoy
seeing these beautiful displays? My children get so excited to see Christmas lights that they
seem to point out every single house decorated with them.
As you know, Christmas displays come in all shapes and sizes – from simple to having so many
lights that you need sun glasses to look at them. But what impresses me most about a Christmas
display is not its beauty and brilliance (and trust me, through my travels I have seen some truly
impressive displays) but the message it conveys.
I vividly remember one in particular – although I can’t say where I saw it. I just remember
driving with my parents at night down a dark highway and a lighted, lone house appearing in the
middle of a dark field. The lights were simple: there were no colors, Santas, or flashing lights
moving to a musical beat. The was just one, large, white Star of David and the message “Peace
On Earth” written so visibly and clearly that no one could ever miss it traveling through the
darkness.
Today we are also going to talk about a Christmas Light that no one could miss; a light that, even
though it looks simple, its beauty is beyond comparison because of the wonderful message it
conveys. Let us learn to celebrate a better Christmas with a better Christmas Light, namely
with the light of Jesus shining through us.
Part One: Jesus shining
Right before our sermon text, the apostle John begins his Gospel by describing Jesus as the
“Word,” who not only existed from eternity with God, but is, in fact, God himself. Jesus is also
called the Light shining in the darkness – to whom John the Baptist testified.
And this is where our text begins: The true light that gives light to every man was coming into
the world. He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not
recognize him. . . .
Why does Scripture call Jesus “Light”? It’s because mankind is living in the dark. Let me
explain what I mean with an illustration: If you went down to the middle of the old boiler room
of this Church, and had someone turn off the lights and close the door, you would not be able to
see at all. You might get disoriented and hurt yourself by running into things. In a place like the
old boiler room – with all the pipes and objects sticking this way and that, you need light to
navigate through the dangerous darkness to safely find your way out.
Our world is trapped in spiritual darkness – not realizing the deadly danger it is in. The world
neither sees its corruption, recognizes its God, nor acknowledges its need for a Savior. Even
though it is continually searching for true meaning, peace and love, the world can never find it.
Why not? Because it is living in such spiritual darkness that it not only is ignorant of the truth, it
also refuses to heed God’s call to come into the light.
But why don’t people want to come into the light of God’s Word? Because they are afraid of
what they might see. Let me explain what I mean.
I think it would be fun looking into a mirror in absolute darkness. Why? Because I can imagine
myself to be whomever I want. I could imagine myself with a head full of long flowing hair and
a tanned, athletic body. I could convince myself that this is who I really am because I can’t
really see myself in the dark. But turn on the light, and then the truth about me is seen – and it is
not anything like I imagine!
This is how it is with the world. Humanity thinks it knows itself - always congratulating itself
for how it thinks it's progressing. Many people imagine themselves as basically good and
deserving of God’s every blessing.
But when God shines the light of his holy law upon us, we see ourselves for what we truly are -
and it isn’t close to anything we imagine. God’s law reveals us as totally corrupt and sinful. We
do not deserve God’s love in the least. We are helplessly lost and, if left to fend for ourselves,
doomed to eternal death in hell. The world does not like hearing this truth. This is why it
doesn’t want to come into the light of God’s Word.
But what the world fails to realize is that God’s light doesn’t only show us our sins, it also shows
us our salvation. God’s light reveals who He is, His love and all that He has done to save us.
And this is where Jesus comes in. He is God’s light: the true revelation of both God’s justice and
mercy. To see, hear and know him is to see, know and hear the true God. He has come to reveal
the way of salvation so that we can be safe and live forever with him in heaven.
And what is the way of salvation? Simply this: to repent of all sin and look to Jesus in faith for
forgiveness - trusting that He has fully paid for every one of our sins through his perfect life,
innocent death and glorious resurrection.
Jesus is the true Christmas light, and oh, how beautiful he is! He did not come in great pomp as
a gaudy Christmas display, but as a lowly babe - born into a poor, simple family. And yet, like
that lone farm house in a dark field (which I mentioned at the beginning of the sermon) He
shines forth a most important message: ""Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I
will give you rest. (Matthew 11:28, NIV84). Yes, come to Christ. Lay all your burdens, fears
and - most importantly - sins at his feet, and He will heal you. It is true that, coming into the
light means you will have to acknowledge things about yourself that you will not want to
acknowledge. Admitting our utter sinfulness is always difficult. But there is genuine healing in
His light - true forgiveness, life and salvation.
Coming into the light of Christ through repentance and faith will move us to sing with aged
Simeon: Sovereign Lord, as you have promised, you now dismiss your servant in peace. For my
eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the sight of all people, a light for
revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people Israel. (Luke 2:29-32, NIV84)
Yes, Jesus is the great Christmas light of all Christmas lights who has come to give us peace with
God and guide us home to heaven. Blessed are all who believe this; because, as the last part of
our sermon text states:
Part Two: Through us.
to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children
of God--
13 children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but
born of God.
Light is very important to humans. We need light. Not only does it give us direction and sight,
but also nourishment and life. Our bodies produce vitamins on the basis of the sunlight we are
exposed to. It physically changes us.
If physical light has such an effect on us, how much more the light of Christ! When we receive
him we are changed. His Word gives us spiritual life and strengthens us in it, as Jesus said: ""I
am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light
of life.” (John 8:12)
Through the miracle of faith, the light of Jesus makes us his children, as he himself once said:
Put your trust in the light while you have it, so that you may become sons of light."" (John 12:36)
And as children of the light who bask in all the wonderful ways God has blessed and saved us,
we become illuminated ourselves. Like the moon staring at the sun and reflecting its light
towards this dark earth, so we too, as we stare at the Son of God, reflect his light to the dark
world around us, drawing attention to him and his salvation.
We are God’s great Christmas lights in the world, shining brilliantly as we share the Gospel of
Jesus with our family and friends. Event though we might feel a little scared to confess Christ to
others, the light of his “good news of great joy” overwhelms us to such a degree that we can’t
help but reflect the brilliance of His love to those around us. Jesus encourages us with these
words: 14 “You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden.
15 Neither do people
light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to
everyone in the house.
16 In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see
your good deeds and praise your Father in heaven. (Matthew 5:14-16)
Christmas lights are certainly beautiful to behold. But the most beautiful Christmas lights of all
are you as you shine forth the light of Christ. When I see you, brothers and sisters in Christ, I see
Jesus because of the faith He put in your hearts.
So celebrate Christmas with better Christmas lights: not the lights that go on the house, but with
the light of Christ that shines in the Gospel and is reflected into the world through you.
Celebrate a better Christmas by rejoicing with other Christians throughout this Christmas season
- encouraging one another with the light of Christ and shining it in our community by inviting
others to come and hear the good news. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",12/6/2015,
"It’s hard to imagine Christmas without Christmas trees. They are wonderful to look at and, when
freshly cut, offer an uplifting aroma. A Christmas tree can even be a window into our past; for,
as we decorate it with special, old ornaments, pleasant family memories of bygone Christmases
often fill our minds.
But where did the idea of a Christmas tree come from? There certainly is no mention of
decorating a freshly chopped pine tree in the Bible. You may hear people claim that the
Christmas tree has pagan origins – possibly from either the Roman “Saturnalia” or Scandinavian
“Yule” festival – but I don’t see any evidence supporting these theories.
The truth is that we don’t exactly know where the tradition of having a Christmas tree comes
from. They just sort of appeared in medieval Europe. Many historians credit Martin Luther with
putting the first Christmas lights on a Christmas tree. Legend has it that he was walking through
the forest one night – looking at the stars through the trees. The scene was so beautiful that he
wanted to recreate it for his family – so he cut down a tree, brought it into his house and fastened
candles to it.
Since I have rambled on about Christmas tree history and theory, you might wonder what all this
has to do with God’s Word. Well, there is one historical tradition I have yet to mention, which
ties into our sermon text for today: the tradition of the Paradise Tree.
You see, back in medieval Germany there was a tradition of celebrating “Adam and Eve” day on
December 24th when Christians would remember the fall into sin and God’s promise of a Savior.
They would decorate a pine tree with either apples or red and gold globes resembling fruit, to
remind themselves of the Tree of Life that was in the Garden of Eden.
What is the Tree of Life? It was a tree that God planted in the middle of the Garden of Eden near
the well-known Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Before they fell into sin, Adam and
Eve were allowed to eat fruit from the Tree of Life; and its fruit seems to have been very special.
Why do I say that? Because after Adam and Eve ate from the forbidden tree of the Knowledge
of Good and Evil, the LORD banished them from the Garden Eden with the specific purpose of 
keeping them from gaining access to the Tree of Life; because if they ate the fruit of that tree
now, they would live forever in their state of sin!
The medieval Paradise Tree with its evergreen needles and red and golden glass balls was not
only meant to remind people of the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, but also of another Tree
of Life mentioned in the last chapter of the last book of the Bible: the Tree of Life that is in
heaven. God has not banished mankind to death forever. He has provided a way for them to be
forgiven and live. The Tree of Life will grow once again, and those who “wash their robes” will
be able to partake of the fruit of that tree. They will be allowed to live forever in the paradise
that our LORD Jesus Christ is preparing for us.
Just think about this for a moment: In the beginning of the Bible the Tree of Life is mentioned,
and then again at the end of the Bible. In the beginning of the Bible the Tree of Life is
mentioned as something we lost access to because of sin; and at the end of the Bible as
something we will gain access to once again. But how exactly do we gain access to the Tree of
Life? Our text tells us: by washing our robes.
Now, before all of you go home and start doing laundry like crazy, let me explain what to “wash
our robes” actually means. Scripture often uses the analogy of “clothing” to explain our spiritual
condition. In order to gain access to God we need to be perfect and holy – with not a spot of sin
soiling our nature. The problem is that we are anything but pure and holy in God’s sight. We all
have inherited a selfish, sinful nature from Adam and Eve – one that constantly breaks God’s
laws. Because of this sinful nature, even the good we do is tainted with sin, as Isaiah writes: All
of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. (Isaiah
64:6 NIV84)
Because of our sins, we do not deserve the right to eat from the Tree of Life. We deserve eternal
death and damnation. But God did not want us to die. He wanted to cleanse us from our sins.
He wanted to save us. And this is why he sent his Son into the world – as the famous Gospel
passage states: God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes
in him shall not perish but have eternal life. (John 3:16, NIV84). This is what we celebrate at
Christmas: Jesus, true God from eternity, coming into the world to take on human flesh and
blood in order to be our Savior.
I want to tell you about another Christmas tradition. Long before I was a pastor at Zebaoth in
Milwaukee, that congregation had a tradition of decorating one enormous, freshly cut pine tree –
far taller than any regular “Church sized” Christmas tree. After the Christmas season was over,
instead of throwing the tree out, they cut off all the boughs and branches from its trunk. They
would then cut the trunk in two and, at Lent, fashion the two pieces into a life-size cross that 
would take a prominent place in front of the sanctuary. Every year a beautiful, ornate Christmas
tree became a barren cross.
The clear point of that tradition was this: Jesus was born to suffer death for us. You see, no
earthly detergent can cleanse us from sin. Only the blood of Jesus (the Lamb of God) shed on
the cross can. This is why the Bible says that the people in heaven are those who have washed
their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. (Revelation 7:14, NIV84)
I talked about the Tree of Life mentioned both at the beginning of the Bible and at the end. But
there is another Tree of Life I want to talk about and that is Jesus himself. Now the Bible does
not necessarily call Jesus the Tree of Life, but it does say that we can only have eternal life
through faith in him - and this brings be back to one more tradition I want to tell you about
concerning the medieval “Adam and Eve day” trees.
Some towns didn’t only decorate their “paradise” trees with glass balls and fruit, they also hung
bread wafers on them (which later generations replaced with cookies). Do you think you can
figure out why?
It was to illustrate the truth Jesus expressed when he said: I am the bread of life. Your
forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died. But here is the bread that comes down
from heaven, which a man may eat and not die. I am the living bread that came down from
heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. This bread is my flesh, which I will give
for the life of the world."" (John 6:48-51, NIV 84).
Jesus is our Tree of Life. It is only through repentance and faith him that we receive eternal
salvation, as He himself says: """"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the
Father except through me. (John 14:6, NIV84) ""I am the resurrection and the life. He who
believes in me will live, even though he dies; and whoever lives and believes in me will never
die” (John 11:25-26 NIV84).
Because if this fact, dear brothers and sisters in Christ, let us celebrate a better Christmas this
year with a better Christmas Tree. As you begin to decorate your tree this holiday season, don’t
just think about wonderful memories of Christmas’ past, and “oh how beautiful” your Christmas
tree is. Rather, think also about the symbolism in that tree. Remember the Garden of Eden and
the fall into sin, and think about your own sinfulness and need for a Saviour. Remember Jesus,
who is called the shoot from the stump of Jesse, and the Life he gives us through repentance and
faith in him. Finally remember the Tree of Life that is waiting for us in the new paradise that
will be created for us when Christ comes again. Think of the joy we will have eating fruit from
that tree and living in perfect, sinless harmony with our God forever and ever. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",11/29/2015,
"I am happy to see each of you here today. I realize how tempting it was to sleep in, use this time
to prepare Thanksgiving dinner, or do other things on this holiday morning. Instead, you came
here to thank the Lord for all the good things he has done for you - just like the Samaritan in our
Gospel lesson.
The main purpose of today’s sermon text is to reveal Jesus’ divine power to heal even the worst
physical diseases. If he can do this, than he must be the Christ who deserves our total worship
and praise.
Having said that, I also believe that this text can serve as an excellent illustration of both how we
are saved and our proper response to our salvation. And it’s these things we will consider this
morning under the theme: Celebrate a Samaritan’s Thanksgiving 1) See how Christ healed
you from the leprosy of sin 2) Come back to offer him true thanksgiving.
Part One: See how Christ healed you from the leprosy of sin
Our sermon text begins: Now on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus traveled along the border between
Samaria and Galilee. As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him.
Leprosy is a highly infectious skin disease that corrupts the flesh. God’s Old Testament law
commanded lepers to be separated from the rest of the community. They were not allowed in the
temple unless they were healed. They lived in camps outside of villages and cities, and had to
yell, “Unclean! Unclean!"" if anyone would come near so that a healthy person could avoid
contact with them.
Spiritually speaking, we are all like lepers before God. The highly infectious disease of sin has
thoroughly corrupted our nature. We are unclean and have been barred from heaven until our sin
is taken away. We are helpless, sick and - if it weren’t for Jesus - dying without hope.
Thankfully we aren’t without Jesus, and neither were the ten lepers in our text. Somehow they
heard about him - his miracles and compassion - and believed that he could heal them from their
horrible disease. This is why, when they heard that Jesus was passing by the area, they did not
yell, “Unclean! Unclean!” Instead, they stood at a distance (so as not to make him unclean) and
called out in a loud voice, ""Jesus, Master, have pity on us!”
And Jesus pitied them. His divine, all-knowing nature saw them before they even knew he was
there. He planned to be present at that moment so that they might call out to him for the mercy
that he had already decided to show them from before the creation of the world.
In a similar yet greater way, Jesus saw us from eternity. He planned for us to hear about him and
his love through the preaching of His Word. He did this so that, both recognizing our sins and
trusting in His mercy, we would cry out to him while he is near.
And that is exactly what we have been led to do. Just as the ten lepers recognized Jesus as their
master, from whom they deserve nothing - so we too recognize that we are nothing but beggars
before God, who are not entitled to receive anything from him. And yet, like the lepers, we trust
that Jesus has the power and authority to help us. More than that, we trust that if we simply ask
him for mercy, he will show it. Why? Because of who he is: our loving Savior who came to
deliver us from sin, death and the power of the devil. And so we continually cry out “kyrie
eleison” - LORD, have mercy.
We read: When he saw them, he said, ""Go, show yourselves to the priests."" And as they went,
they were cleansed.
Knowing the desire of their heart, Jesus sent them to the priest. Why? Not to be healed, but that
they might be declared clean in accordance with the law of Moses. No, Jesus had not yet healed
them, but he would. He wanted them to act on faith, and that is exactly what they did. So they
walked - still sick and covered with sores - trusting that Jesus would keep his Word.
And Jesus kept his word. They were all cleansed of their leprosy.
This healing most excellently illustrates our spiritual cleansing from sin. How often don’t we
call out to Jesus in repentance - feeling the great burden of our sin? God’s Word tells us that we
are forgiven, but we certainly don’t feel it. Like the lepers leaving Jesus for the temple - still
seeing their leprosy - we still see our sins and guilt. Are we really forgiven? And this is where
faith comes in: no matter how we feel, we take Jesus at his Word. And so we confidently
approach God in prayer - trusting in his promise to forgive. We walk by faith, not by feelings!
And, as we trust in Jesus' promise of forgiveness, a change comes over us. We are forgiven, and
that forgiveness brings us great joy. Jesus has healed us from our leprosy of sin, let us now see
how we can offer him true thanksgiving.
Part Two: Come back to offer him true thanksgiving.
15 One of them, when he saw he was healed, came back, praising God in a loud voice. 16 He
threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him--and he was a Samaritan. 17 Jesus asked, ""Were not
all ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? 18 Was no one found to return and give praise to
God except this foreigner?""
Where were the other nine? I imagine that as soon as they saw they were healed they smiled,
offered a quick prayer to God, and ran double time to the priest so that they could be publicly
declared clean. I imagine that some of them went back to their family and friends, with whom
they were not allowed to have contact for such a long time. I imagine the others thought about
how they would do all sorts of incredible things now that they were healed: how they would live
life to the fullest - enjoying every moment of their health. They were given a new lease on life
and did not want to squander it.
Sadly, however, that is exactly what they did: squander their new lease on life. Jesus did not
heal them that they could live life to the fullest, but that they could live their life for him. He
wanted them to enter into a new relationship with him.
Every proper gift is meant to draw attention to the compassion of its giver - to create or
strengthen a bond of love between to giver and receiver. This fact was missed by the nine
Jewish lepers. All they cared about was the gift - not giving a second thought to him who gave
it. And in doing so, they lost the greatest gift of all - salvation.
Unfortunately, these nine lepers do a good job illustrating how many Christians receive God’s
gift of forgiveness after confession. Yes, they are happy that they are forgiven - and maybe even
offer a quick prayer to God for it. But, instead of seeing how this forgiveness is meant to draw
them closer to the LORD, they merely think about how it can serve their earthly advantage. Just
like the nine Jewish lepers, they don’t realize they have done anything wrong. However, since
their hearts are not on Jesus - they end up squandering their spiritual healing.
You see, the absolution we receive after confession is not merely meant to relieve our feelings of
guilt so that we can get our lives back on the path we had planned out for ourselves. The gift of
forgiveness is meant to draw us into a closer relationship with Jesus. And if we aren’t drawn
into a closer relationship with him, we soon forget him - losing our source of salvation in the
process.
This is why Jesus praises the faith of the Samaritan leper, saying: ""Rise and go; your faith has
[saved] you.
Now, if you were following along with me in the bulletin, you might notice that I changed “made
you well” to “save.” I did this on purpose because this is what Jesus actually said - “made well”
is merely the NIV’s interpretation of the Greek word “saved.”
But I like there word “saved”. Why? Because I am convinced that when Jesus talks about how
the leper's faith saved him, he is referring to far more than the physical healing granted to all the
lepers. He is talking about a special faith the Holy Spirit awakened in the Samaritan's heart,
which caused him to trust in Jesus as his true God and Savior. The Samaritan leper's faith
“saved” him in the sense that it grabbed hold of Jesus. You can see this in the thanksgiving the
leper offered: how he was unashamed to publicly praise God with a loud voice - telling everyone
what great things Jesus had done for him. This leper put his life on hold to come back to Jesus
and thank him - not wanting to leave Christ’s side until Jesus was ready to let him go.
Brothers and sisters in Christ; let us learn to celebrate this Samaritan's kind of thanksgiving.
How? By not receiving God’s gifts in a self-serving way. Rather let us receive them for their
intended purpose: as a means to get us to think about his great love for us. God gives his gifts so
that we might constantly thank him - that is, constantly think about him and his gracious work of
providing all the blessings and forgiveness we need for our physical and spiritual life.
Jesus wants us to continually receive all his gifts like the Samaritan leper - not just offering a
quick prayer and moving on, but running back to him every time there is worship; and when
there isn’t, seeking him through private Bible reading at home. He wants us to tell our family,
friends and neighbors about all the great things he has done so that they too might repent, believe
and have eternal life.
This is how our God wants us to thank him: not merely by coming to church today, but by
remaining with him every day - always rejoicing in who he is and what he has done for us. This,
brothers and sisters in Christ, is how we celebrate a Samaritan’s thanksgiving. May the LORD
continually move us to do so. Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",11/26/2015,
"Imagine for a moment that you are driving along Highway 29 - speeding because you have to get
to Green Bay fast. (For some of us, maybe this isn’t that hard to imagine!) All of a sudden you
see red and blue lights in your rear view mirror and your heart sinks. This is going to be an
expensive one! As you pull over and wait for the officer, butterflies form in your stomach as you
imagine what you are going to say. You hear the tap at your window, look up and, what do you
know: the police officer is a really good friend of yours! Even though you’re embarrassed, you
still feel a little sense of relief. Why? Because, you don’t have to lie or cover up your sin to
him. He knows you and is more likely to be merciful than a police officer you don’t know.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: throughout this month we have been reminded that judgment is
coming. As we watch the news and see the signs being fulfilled that Jesus said would precede
that day, we can’t help but be a little afraid: the all holy God is coming to judge the living and
the dead. Moreover, we have sinned against him in thought, word and deed. We have clearly
broken his law. What excuse can we offer? What can we say to keep us from being sent to hell?
But look again at the one coming to judge the living and the dead: it is Jesus, our human brother
and dearest friend, who is able to sympathize with our weakness. More than this; he has done
everything necessary to forgive us of all sins.
Yes, it’s good to have a friend in authority – especially the one who is in absolute authority.
Today, on Christ the King Sunday, we are going to rejoice in the fact that Jesus, our human
brother, is sitting on the throne of God ruling over all things for us, under the theme: For Thine
is The Kingdom, and the Power and the Glory 1) Jesus is ruling now in time. 2) Jesus will
rule into time eternal.
Part One: Jesus is ruling now in time.
Our sermon text for this morning is part of a terrifying vision that Daniel had in Babylon. He
dreamed of four vicious beasts which came out of the sea. They were frightful and powerful to
rule and kill. So terrifying was the vision that, even after the dream was interpreted for him, his 
face turned pale. But Daniel also saw the LORD himself – sitting in court and ready to judge.
The LORD would put an end to rule of the final beast.
And this is where our text comes in: “In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was
one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and
was led into his presence. 14 He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples,
nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that
will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
What does all this mean? If you read a little further in this chapter of Daniel, the Lord himself
gives us the interpretation: “The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the
earth. But the saints of the Most High will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever—yes,
for ever and ever.’ ”
i
Basically Daniel saw a vision of world history up until the time the Christ would come.
Terrifying kingdoms would arise and oppress God’s people, but the LORD would nevertheless
remain in control. He will judge those Kingdoms and give all authority to his dearly loved Son –
who also happens to be a man.
Now throughout this sermon you will hear me refer to Jesus as a man. Let me get one thing
straight. Jesus is true God. He is of one essence with the Father. He is not a creature, but rather
the creator of all things. I do not deny these facts about Jesus and it is important for us to stress
them in a world that tries to deny his divinity.
But sometimes we spend so much time talking about the divinity of Jesus, that we forget the
wonderful, comforting fact that Jesus is also a true human being. This is what Christmas is all
about: Jesus who is true God from all eternity, taking on human flesh and blood so that he could
live under the law, die and rise again in order to save us. The eternal Son of God chose to be a
brother of our race.
In his vision, Daniel saw one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He
approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence. This is fascinating on so many
levels. First of all notice where this “son of man” came from. Humans are made of earth, but
this man came from heaven. What is more, he could stand before God the Father – the “Ancient
of Days” – and live. This is something no sinful human could ever do before, so how is it
possible now? Because, even though this man has been tempted in every way, just as we are—
yet [he] was without sin.ii
 And because Jesus, the perfect man, suffered and died for all our
sins, we too can stand before God– as the author of Hebrews states: “Therefore, since we have a
great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to
the faith we profess. . . . Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we
may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.”iii
This is why we are so happy to see Jesus, our human brother, before the throne of God. Because
he is there, we can be there. Through Him we have access to the Father.
iv
In his vision, Daniel saw Jesus was given authority, glory and sovereign power. Will this
happen at the end of time? It certainly will be seen at the end of time that Jesus has all authority,
but that is not when Jesus received it. No, this happened at Jesus’ ascension. Right now Jesus
has all authority, glory and power. Right now he is in full control over everything and everyone
- ruling over all for the benefit of his church.
At the beginning of the sermon I mentioned what a comfort it is to know someone in authority –
especially someone who is in complete authority. And this is our status with God right now.
I know that sometimes this world seems like it is, proverbially speaking, going to hell in a
handbasket – and in a certain sense, it actually is! Materialism, love of self, absolute total
disregard for God and his word – all these things are around us. We feel this world’s allure, the
temptation of our flesh, and doubts aroused by the devil. We often fall into a vicious cycle of sin
and guilt that we can’t get ourselves out of, causing us to cry out with the apostle Paul: What a
wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?v
Thank God we know the one in authority, and that he also knows us. Yes, Jesus is in control.
He is our dear human brother who cares for us so much that He died on the cross to remove the
guilt of our sins. He suffered our punishment so that we could be at total peace with the LORD.
He has done this for us, and he is doing even more.
He is sitting on the throne of God, mediating with his Father on our behalf – telling him how
much he loves us. How do I know this? Because of the promise recorded in Romans: Christ
Jesus . . . is at the right hand of God and is also interceding for us. vi
 Right now Jesus is ruling
over everything – directing even bad things like crime, terror, disease, disasters, death and any
other evil you hear about – to ultimately benefit his church. How do I know this? Because of
the Holy Spirit’s promise that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who
have been called according to his purpose.vii
 Jesus our, dear brother, has the kingdom, and the
power and the glory now, and will use it to bring us to himself forever.
Part Two: Jesus will rule into time eternal.
Daniel writes: He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men
of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass
away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.
All people will worship Jesus. “What?” you might be wondering, “How about those who deny
him? Will everyone be converted at the end of time?” No, sadly the vast majority of the human
race will deny Jesus all their way into hell - but they will still have to worship him. At the end of
time, when Jesus comes from the clouds with the angels of God, every knee will bow and every
tongue will confess that Jesus is LORD. The difference will be that the believers will do it in
joy, whereas the unbelievers will do it in terror. Nevertheless, all nations will worship him.
But it does not stop there. When Christ comes again, he will bring with him the new heavens
and new earth that he is even now preparing for us: the perfect paradise of God. On this new 
heaven and new earth there will be no more crying or pain, nor more sin or death – because the
old order of things will have passed away. There will only be praise of God – and complete and
utter joy for those who believed in him and his work of saving us.
And all nations will be represented there. St. John’s Revelation tells us that the people in heaven
will consist of a multitude that no one can count from every tribe, people and language.
Throughout time, God has called, gathered and enlightened his elect from every nation on earth;
and they are a large number. And all of us who believe in Jesus for the forgiveness of sin will
see this sight. We will remain under his gracious reign forever: eating at his table and enjoying
his presence without any fear.
Jesus is our King into eternity. What a comfort this is for us as we suffer under the “beasts” that
arise in this world. What a hope to cling to, as the devil, world and our own sinful natures try
their best to drag us away from our faith in the LORD. We know the man in charge, trust in his
total love for us, and look forward to the day when he will appear to deliver us from this earth.
And as we wait for that day, we trust that Christ is in control, working in all things for our
benefit. For this, let us thank our Savior. For thine, dear Jesus, is the Kingdom, and the Power
and the Glory – forever and ever. Amen.

"What image comes to mind when you hear the word “saint”? Do you think of heroic apostles
like Peter and Paul? Do you imagine Mother Theresa and her selfless work among the poor in
India? Maybe you think about heaven – and all the perfect people shining in glory.
But what about Bob?
“Bob?” you might say, “who's he?” He’s a former alcoholic who, with Christ’s help, had been
overcoming his addiction and sin. After finding out that his wife has cancer, he went to a bar
and got drunk. The worst of it is that, while driving home under the influence, he hit a young
mother of two – killing her instantly. He floods his bed with tears every night – begging the
LORD to forgive him.
What about Amy? Who's she? A young woman who got involved in the “adult” entertainment
industry. Two years ago, she met someone who told her about Christ. Now she struggles with
the fact that, even though she is Christian, all these pictures and videos of her former life are still
being distributed over the internet – leading others into sin.
What about Kevin? He is a young Christian man addicted to internet images of Amy and others
like her. When caught by his wife he repented of his sin and went to the pastor for help. Still
every day is a struggle and he wonders if he will ever be rid of this powerful addiction.
What about Carla? She is an older Christian woman who just shared some juicy gossip with a
neighbor. While walking home she remembered the 8th commandment and realized that she –
yet again – ruined someone’s reputation with her wicked tongue. No wonder people avoid her.
Can she find forgiveness for this, her umpteenth time of gossiping?
So what about Bob, Amy, Kevin and Carla – are these the kind of people you imagine when you
hear the word “saints”? No? Well you should because, for Christ’s sake, that is exactly who
they are! Let us meditate on this truth and, with the Holy Spirit's help, always recognize from
where our triumph over sin comes and in what our triumph actually consists under the theme:
Saints Triumphant!
Part One: From Where Our Triumph Comes
What is a saint? According to the Bible it is someone who has been set apart by the LORD and
is triumphant over all sin - completely holy and righteous in God’s sight. Only saints will be
spared from hell and be given the gift of eternal life with God in paradise. If this is true (and it
is) then it’s vitally important for us to know who the saints are and how to become one.
The natural inclination of man is to think that we can earn God’s favor and forgiveness on our
own. “If I’m a good person,” we think, ""God will have to love and accept me.” But there’s a
problem with such thinking: what is good enough? Humans think that simply being mostly kind,
compassionate and caring is enough for God. But it’s not. God’s Word says: Be perfect,
therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect. (Mat 5:48 NIV84) For whoever keeps the whole
law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. (Jam 2:10 NIV84)
These passages are clear: none of us are good enough to be considered saints on our own. God
demands perfection, and we are imperfect.
“But that’s ok,” some people think. “I will just offer sacrifices to God to atone for my own sin.
I’ll do more good than bad. I’ll give to charity and help people. I will do all the outward things
God commands in His Word – this is how I’ll get right with God!”
No you won’t. Consider for a moment all the sacrifices God’s Old Testament people offered to
the LORD. “Day after day,” our sermon text says, “every priest stands and performs his
religious duties; again and again he offers the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.”
Every morning and evening a Lamb was sacrificed for the sins of the people – offerings that God
himself commanded – and yet none of them actually atoned for sin. Did you catch the point?
It’s the same one Paul makes in his letter to the Romans, where he writes: Therefore no one will
be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law; rather, through the law we become
conscious of sin. (Rom 3:20 NIV84)
All our goodness and sacrifice counts for nothing before God. Why not? Because God is holy
and perfect and we are tainted with sin. There is nothing that we can do to atone for our sins.
So where, then, can we find the perfect righteousness and forgiveness we need to stand before
God? Not in our deeds or keeping of the law – that’s for sure. No, our righteousness can only be
found in one place: Jesus. His one sacrifice was able to atone for the sins of all people for all
time, as we read: 12 But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat 
down at the right hand of God. 13 Since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his
footstool.
Just think of the contrast between Jesus and all the priests before him. None of them were ever
able to finish their work because none of their sacrifices could actually atone for sin. But then
came Jesus – true God and true man. He was able to live the perfect life we all failed to live –
thereby winning the righteousness we need to stand before God. He took all our sins upon
himself in order to pay for them in full through his suffering and death on the cross. And for
whose sins, exactly, was Jesus able to make this atonement? Was it only for the good people on
this earth? No, but for the sins of all people of all time - including you and me.
On the cross, Jesus said, “It is finished,” and finished it was. Every sin had been forgiven! How
do we know this is true? How do we know that God the Father accepted the redemption price
paid by His Son? By the fact that Jesus rose from the dead! And not only that, he also ascended
into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father, from where he will come to judge
the living and the dead.
Yes, when Christ comes again, his triumph over sin, death and the power of the devil will be
experienced by all. But until then, He remains in heaven – patiently ruling over the affairs of this
earth until Judgment day. But, when that day comes, what we are will also be seen by all – for
every believer in Christ is a saint triumphant.
But how is this possible? How can I be a saint? Even though I don’t want to, I sin every single
day. And my sins are not simply little things that can be ignored. They often hurt people I love.
Worse than that, they are offensive to God – revealing that I don’t truly fear, love and trust in
him above all things. How can any of us be saints before God when we know our sins? How
can any of us sing the songs of triumph when we feel the agony of defeat in our consciences?
We can because by one sacrifice [Jesus] has made perfect forever those who are being made
holy. Brothers and sisters in Christ just think about what this verse means: By Jesus' once-andfor-all
sacrifice of himself on the cross we were made perfect. Our sins are gone – forever. And
to whom does Jesus apply this triumph over sin, death and the power of the devil - won for every
person in world history? He applies it to everyone who looks to him in repentance and faith.
Christ’s sacrifice makes such people holy – continually cleansing them from sin and renewing in
them a heart that fears, loves and trusts the LORD above all things.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: do you remember the Bob, Amy, Kevin and Carla I mentioned at
the beginning of the sermon? Now you can understand why we can think of them as saints. No
matter what sins we have committed in the past, what problems pursue us in the present or
temptations we will face in the future, we remain triumphant saints through faith in Christ. Now
that we know from where (or better yet, from whom) our triumph comes, let us see wherein this
triumph consists.
Part Two: Wherein Our Triumph Consists
Our sermon text continues: The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First he says: 16 “This
is the covenant I will make with them after that time, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their
hearts, and I will write them on their minds.” 17 Then he adds: “Their sins and lawless acts I will
remember no more.” 18 And where these have been forgiven, there is no longer any sacrifice for
sin.
From before the creation of the world, God planned a way to rescue his people from sin. He
knew that, after the fall, we would never be able to save ourselves. We were lost and condemned
creatures; helpless - without any hope of salvation. So what did God do? He promised to make
a new covenant with us – not based on trying to earn righteousness through our works, but one in
which He would both forgive all our sins and move us to truly know, trust and love Him as our
God.
And this is wherein our triumph consists. Through the preaching of His Word, the Holy Spirit
has put his teaching in our hearts and mind. He has opened our eyes to see who He is, and to
recognize how gravely we have offended him. But he didn’t stop there. By means of the
Gospel, the Holy Spirit has revealed to us everything Jesus has done to save us. Having
awakened faith in our hearts, the Holy Spirit has moved us to repent of our sins and believe that
God forgives us for Christ sake. No matter how heavy the guilt of our sins lies on our
conscience, or how the world will not let us forget our past, God forgives it all.
Just think of what this means for Christians like Bob, Amy, Kevin and Carla – or for you and
me: no matter how badly the knowledge of past sins haunt us, through faith in Christ, we remain
saints triumphant in the eyes of God. There is no sacrifice, not thing we must do to atone for our
sins. Jesus has done it all. We are saints over whom the Holy Spirit continues to watch –
instructing us through word and sacrament so that, no matter how messy our lives become
because of sin, we remain God’s forgiven children, – and want to live to His glory and not our
own.
Brothers and sisters in Christ – because of Jesus’ once and for all sacrifice on the cross, you are a
saint – 100% holy and righteous in God’s sight. Christ’s triumph is your triumph – not just in
the future, but right now. Because you are a saint through faith in Christ Jesus, you can fight the
good fight against temptation and sin. God is with you and will give you the victory. Yes, even
if you fall into sin, you have not lost the war. Repent and God will forgive you – all because of
Christ Jesus and his work. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",11/15/2015,
"Imagine the scene: an overly confident man makes crude advances towards a woman in a bar.
She warns him to leave her alone, saying “Don’t you know who I am?” The man doesn’t care
and keeps on harassing her until she leaves - calling her obscene names as she walks away.
A week later the same man goes to court for a DUI offense. Even though it wasn’t a minor
incident, he is confident that he will be able to schmooze the judge into dismissing the charge.
To the man’s dismay, when the bailiff says, “All rise,” who walks in but the very woman he
harassed a week earlier.
What is the moral of the story? If you are going to court, you better know who your judge is.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: our great day in God’s court is fast approaching when we will
have to give an account for our every thought, word and deed. With Jesus as our guide. Let us
consider the most important step in preparing for that day, under the theme: Know your Judge
1) Understand His relationship to the Father. 2) Listen to His Words so as not to fall under
judgment.
Part One: Understand his relationship to the Father.
Our sermon text takes place right after Jesus, on a certain Sabbath day, healed a man who had
been lame for 38 years lying near the pool of Bethesda. Some Jews took offense and condemned
Jesus for breaking the Law. What was Jesus' response? That he had every right and authority to
heal on the Sabbath day because of his relationship to God the Father. Jesus said to them, ""My
Father is always at his work to this very day, and I, too, am working."" For this reason the Jews
tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling
God his own Father, making himself equal with God.i
Therefore Jesus, out of love for those lost souls who were condemning him, explains how his
actions testify to exactly who He is. He says: ""I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by
himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son
also does.
Even though He is a distinct person, Jesus is also “of one being with the Father”
ii
– intimately
united with Him. To see and know Jesus is to see and know God. And just as God the Father is
always at work for the preservation and salvation of man, so is Jesus.
That the Jews might know Him is exactly why Jesus did what He did – fulfilling all Scripture
concerning the Messiah.
And so Jesus goes on to say: 20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him all he does. Yes, to
your amazement he will show him even greater things than these.
Jesus was not some blasphemer – ignorant of God and under His wrath. No, just the opposite
was true: Jesus was the only human not standing under God’s wrath – the only person with a
perfect knowledge of God and perfectly loved by the Father. How so? Because of the divine
relationship they shared! And even though this relationship can be seen in the healing Jesus
performed, God the Father would glorify His Son by allowing Him to perform greater acts than
these. Jesus points the Jews forward to two miracles that would demonstrate his divine Sonship
beyond any shadow of a doubt.
21 For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom
he is pleased to give it.
The Jews rightly believed that only God can raise a person to life. What conclusion should we
draw, then, from Jesus' raising of Jairus’ daughter, the widow of Nain’s son, Lazarus and even
himself after his crucifixion? That he is not only the Son of God, but God the Son!
God the Father has given Jesus the power to raise the dead – not just physically, but spiritually as
well. The fact that any of us believe in Christ for salvation is a miracle in and of itself. The
Bible says that we were once dead in our sins, hopelessly lost and condemned. But Jesus, in
mercy, saved us: not only through His life, death and resurrection, but also by sending His Spirit
to awaken new life in us by means of His Word. Our repentance and faith in Christ is all Jesus’
divine doing, because of which we joyfully look forward to the last Day when Jesus will raise the
dead to either receive eternal life, or be condemned to everlasting shame and contempt.
Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son, 23 that all may
honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the
Father, who sent him.
Only God can judge and condemn. The fact that the Father has entrusted this work to Jesus once
again shows that He is the Christ – God the Son in the flesh. 
How sad was the situation, then, when the Jews persecuted Jesus for blasphemy when, in fact,
they were the ones blaspheming. Without realizing it, they were judging their own Judge;
dishonoring the very God whose honor they thought they were defending.
But what about us? Do we really recognize and honor Jesus as our divine Lord and Savior?
Sure, like the Jews we might claim to fear, love and trust in Him above all things, but what do
our actions say when we skip church: having “more important” things to do than hear the Word
and receive the very body and blood He used to win our salvation on the cross?
“Jesus, I love you,” we say. What if Jesus were to respond, “Really? Then how come you don’t
make spending time with me in my house your greatest priority? How come you spend almost
all the money I bless you with on yourself instead of offering a portion of it to support the
ministry of the Gospel? How come you refuse to learn more about me in Bible Class or tell your
family and friends about me?” What if Jesus were to say these things to us – what would our
response be? I guess all we could say is: Lord, have mercy on me, a sinner!
But the LORD has been merciful to us. Even though we certainly have demonstrated a lack of
love towards him, He lacks no love towards us! Jesus' underserved love moved him to take on
our flesh in order to pay the sacrificial price needed to redeem us from our sins. In love Jesus
showed us our guilt through the preaching of His holy Law. His Spirit led us to repent and trust
in His Gospel promises to forgive and save us. Yes, how wonderful it is to know that Jesus is
our Judge – He who, with such great love, stopped at nothing to win our salvation. He wants us
to ever recognize who He is and live in a constant state of repentance – always turning to him for
mercy and help to overcome our sinful desire to wander away from His salvation.
Part Two: Listen to his words so as not to fall under judgment.
Jesus spoke a wonderful promise to the Jews who were persecuting him. I tell you the truth,
whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be
condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.
In other words: our great Judge promises to pronounce a “not guilty” verdict over anyone and
everyone who looks to Him in repentance and faith. This declaration is not merely some future
wish. It is a present reality. Right at this very moment everyone who looks to Jesus in faith is
justified before God. Such a person has been raised from spiritual death to spiritual life. Eternal
life belongs to him.
But where does such faith come from? Only through the means of grace: the Gospel in Word
and Sacrament. This is why Jesus places such great importance on studying His Word.
Oh, how sad it is when “Christians” find listening to God’s Word an inconvenience or burden.
There are so many other things we want to do on a Sunday morning except go to worship. We
are afraid of attending Bible class because we might look stupid. We don’t want to read God’s
Word in the morning because we need an extra few minutes of sleep. We don’t want to read a 
devotion in the evening because our favorite T.V. show is on and, after watching, we are too
tired to concentrate. Besides, we probably would not understand half of what we read anyway.
How easily the devil excuses us from both listening to and reading the Gospel. But have you
ever really sat down to think about what you are avoiding? When you neglect reading God’s
Word at home, you miss out on Jesus’ personal message for you - the warnings he wants to give
you about the dangers in your life and the personal comfort and strengthening he wants to bless
you with as you meditate on His promises.
Have you ever considered what you miss when you miss coming to church on Sunday morning?
You miss out on the opportunity to partake in the very body and blood Jesus used to win your
salvation on the cross. You miss out on the special instruction and comfort he offers you through
His Word and the encouragement of His church.
Have you ever really considered what you miss out by not coming to Bible class? You miss out
on the wonderful opportunity to learn more about your beloved Savior. You miss out on the
mutual encouragement your fellow brothers and sisters offer you as you grow together in Christ.
You miss out in having your questions answered and faith strengthened for life.
And if you continually neglect participating in a Bible class, reading your Bible at home and
coming to worship? Well, soon you will miss out on your salvation because: faith comes from
hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ (Romans 10:17).
Brothers and sisters in Christ: don’t act the fool in front of your Judge – not recognizing who he
is. Do not sit in judgment over Him and his Word: accepting from the Bible only what you think
is best and rejecting the rest, or worshipping him only when it is convenient for you. Doing
these things will cause you to fall from faith into judgment. Rather, know your Judge. Come to
Jesus often to hear of his love for you. Listen to his words because they are our only source of
guidance, comfort and salvation. As you come to Jesus in faith, you will be justified because of
His work for you. Then you can be confident that you will hear Jesus say on the last day: Well
done, good and faithful servant! Come and share your master's happiness!' Amen.

"It was a David and Goliath moment – only with a more powerful Goliath, a weaker David and
(arguably) greater stakes!
The date: April 18th, 1521. The place: Worms, Germany. On one side of the room sat the most
powerful man in the world: Charles V. He ruled most of Europe and an ever increasing portion
of the Americas and Africa. Next to him stood a papal legate representing the Antichrist himself.
These spiritual Goliaths were ready for battle – mocking the LORD with the heresy of workrighteousness
that enslaved God’s people.
But there, in the middle of the room, stood the LORD’s chosen David – a lowly shepherd of
souls named Martin Luther. Again – think of the contrast! Charles V, backed not only by the
mightiest militaries in the world but also by hell itself, faced Luther who had neither sling nor
stone in his pocket!
But, like David of old, Luther had an ace up his sleeve: the LORD himself! Scripture passages
like the 46th Psalm gave Luther such confidence and hope in God’s protection that, shortly before
this showdown took place, Luther wrote the hymn: “A Mighty Fortress is our God.”
And so Luther, armed with nothing more than God’s Word and promises, made his good
confession. Unless proved wrong from Scripture, He refused to recant (or take back) anything
he taught. “Here I stand. I can do no other. God help me.” 
And, as history shows, the LORD did help him. True, from a human perspective, Luther lost the
battle. Charles declared him an outlaw – allowing anyone to kill him on sight. But God
protected Luther and, through his teachings, won the war – allowing his Gospel to be restored to
the world.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: our own American society is becoming more and more intolerant
towards our Christian confession. We feel increasing pressure to compromise our faith. We may
even be a little fearful of the future.
Let us, therefore, look to the Psalm Luther looked to when he was tempted to compromise his
confession and give up his faith, under the theme: A Mighty Fortress Is Our God. 1) We will
not fear 2) because the LORD is with us 3) and He will be exalted on the earth.
Part One: We will not fear
Our sermon text begins: God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in trouble. 2
Therefore we will not fear, though the earth give way and the mountains fall into the heart of the
sea, 3 though its waters roar and foam and the mountains quake with their surging.
Every time I read these verses, I can’t help but think back to 2004 when a single giant wave
killed approximately a ¼ million people throughout South East Asia. Just think about that: one
wave killing the equivalent population of Brown County! When the mighty sea swells in anger,
nothing can stand in its path. When the earth quakes with its full force, what cities aren’t
destroyed? Hurricane Katrina, the 2010 earthquake near Haiti, the 2011 earthquake and Tsunami
in Japan - even the strongest of men shudder at the thought of disasters like these.
But they shouldn’t terrify us Christians. Why? Because God is our refuge and strength. The
LORD promises to protect us both from and in every natural disaster. Truth be told, Jesus said
that all floods, earthquakes, wars, and every other disaster you can name are signs that He is
coming soon to deliver His dearly loved believers from this wicked world. Whereas unbelievers
face these disasters in terror, afraid to die and meet their Maker because of their sins and
unbelief, Christians remember Jesus’ promise: When these things begin to take place, stand up
and lift up your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.""1
“A mighty fortress is our God.” He promises to protect believers from all evil. Even if we were
hurt or killed in a natural disaster, God has, nevertheless, kept his promise because “precious in
the sight of the Lord, is the death of his saints. Concerning the death of believers, the LORD 2
says: The righteous are taken away to be spared from evil. Those who walk uprightly enter into
peace; they find rest as they lie in death.3
God is our refuge and strength: this is why we should neither fear when the forces of nature rage
against us physically, nor when the devil and world rage against us spiritually.
By God’s grace we don’t face the threat of physical persecution for our faith that many
Christians face in other countries; but make no mistake: the devil and world rage against us. Just
as Luther was on trial before the princes and powers of this earth, so we are on trial every day –
tempted to lust, covet, doubt, anger and unbelief. Sometimes these temptations feel as powerful
as a tsunami wave - trying to sweep us away from Christ and destroy our soul. Other times we
feel like we are caught in a whirlpool of sin and guilt dragging us to despair. But against these
waters, the LORD is our fortress and refuge. Through faith in the forgiveness of sins He won for
us on His Cross, Christ pulls us out of these waters and sets us on the high Rock of himself,
where these troubled waters can’t reach us.
Yes, when the devil, world and our sinful flesh rage against us, we need not fear. The LORD is
with us - directing us to find refuge and refreshment and in the calm, living water of his Word, as
we read:
Part Two: Because He is with us
There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place where the Most High
dwells. 5 God is within her, she will not fall; God will help her at break of day.
The river and the city of this Psalm are mentioned elsewhere in Scripture. Revelation 21 and 22
pictures the city of God coming from the heavens and having a river in it. What is the city of
God? It is the Church, the total sum of all believers on earth and in heaven. At the end of time,
Christ will gather all his saints together to enjoy the perfect paradise he is now preparing for us.
We will live with Him, under his protection, drinking the water of life.
But understand this: we don’t have to wait until heaven to live with Christ in His city, drinking
the water of life. Every believer is a member of that city right now. Even though we don’t see
Him, Jesus is with us, as He promises: “where two or three come together in my name, there am
I with them."" And, “I am with you always, to the very end of the age."" Right now we can be 4 5
refreshed and gladded by the river of life. How? By looking to Jesus in faith, who once said: ""If
anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has
said, streams of living water will flow from within him."" 6
Jesus, is the river that makes the Church (the city of God) glad. How? By channeling His grace
to us through the Gospel in Word and Sacrament. By these means of grace we are connected to
Christ and washed clean from all sin. In this water our guilt-parched souls find relief and we are
refreshed to carry on the work of exalting his name on the earth.
Nations are in uproar, kingdoms fall. This earth is in constant turmoil and will continue to be a
mess until Christ’s return. Wars and rumors of wars will continue until the time he (the LORD)
lifts his voice, [and] the earth melts. God will put an end to all the turmoil when He comes again
on the Last Day
And how should we live, knowing that Christ is coming again soon? St. Peter tells us: You ought
to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day
will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat. But
in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, the home
of righteousness. 7
The LORD Almighty is with us. Notice that the Psalmist did not write the LORD Almighty “will
be” with us, but rather the LORD almighty is with us. He is our fortress from every spiritual and
physical evil. By means of Holy Baptism we have been adopted into His family. Through faith
in Jesus’ redemptive work we stand forgiven and at peace with God. And, as St. Paul says: If
God is for us, who can be against us? . The devil, world and our own sinful flesh may try, but 8
they will not succeed because the God of Jacob is our fortress. And He will not allow anything
to prevent His name from being exalted on this earth.
Part Three: And he will be exalted on the earth.
8 Come and see the works of the LORD, the desolations he has brought on the earth.
When you page through the chronicles of history – observing the great disasters that have
happened in this world, understand that the LORD’s hand is in it all – guiding and directing
history so as to humble the nations. He works in all things to the glory of His name – for the
spread of His Gospel and the eternal welfare of His Church. This will be most clearly seen at the
end of time when. . .
 9 He makes wars cease to the ends of the earth; he breaks the bow and shatters the spear, he
burns the shields with fire.
When Christ comes to redeem his scattered Church, war will cease. There will no longer be any
hostility, prejudice or hatred among his people. And why? Because sin will be gone. Every
believer will be united with the great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe,
people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb, living at peace with 9
God and each other. Together with them we will sing God’s praises for all eternity.
Because of this, God now calls out to every Christian who is either worried or afraid, saying:
10 ""Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the
earth.""
What a wonderful promise! News reports seem to imply that there is much to worry and stress
over. What is happening to our country? What is happening in our world? But through all the
chaos God wants us to be still. He is in control and is working in all things to the glory of His
saving name – just as He did for Luther as He stood before the imperial council in the city of
Worms. God protected Luther – allowing the continued proclamation of His Gospel.
And the LORD will protect us too as we exalt his name by sharing that Gospel with our family,
friends and neighbors. Sure, confessing Christ is scary – especially when our witness meets with
hostility, slander or persecution. But God promises to work through our confession – even if it’s
rejected. His name will be exalted on this earth. The Last Day will prove it.
And so, dear Christian, as you live your life to God’s glory – don’t be afraid to confess your faith
in Christ – even if the whole world seems against you. Take heart in Scripture’s promise that
gave Luther such great joy: The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress.
Amen",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",11/1/2015,
"When you hear the word “religion,” what thoughts come to your mind? Do you think about people
genuflecting, praying or performing other customs for their god? Ceremonies and sacrifices -
doing certain things in a specific way in order to earn favor with god – this is how the world views
religion.
And we Christians are not immune to such thinking. We also are inclined to view our religion in
terms of our worship, liturgies, prayers and offerings. We are often tempted to believe that these
acts – in and of themselves - set us right with God.
But is this true? No, for as Jesus will instruct us today, true religion is all about love: 1) The
perfect love God requires. 2) The perfect love Christ reveals.
Part One: The perfect love God requires.
It was the busy Tuesday of Holy week. Jesus was in the temple and, right before the events of our
sermon text, some Sadducees (religious scholars who did not believe in the resurrection of the
dead) tried to make Jesus look foolish by asking him an absurd question about life after the
resurrection (in which they didn’t believe).
Jesus’ response not only showed the foolishness of the Sadducees’ question, it also revealed them
as being both ignorant and unbelieving regarding the Scriptures.
And this is where our text breaks in: One of the teachers of the law [a Pharisee] came and heard
them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them [the Sadducees] a good [that is, a beautifully, 
biblically, correct] answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, which is the most
important?”
A little background is needed to understand why the man ask this question: the Pharisees counted
a total of 613 commandments. Most of these laws were a bunch of nit-picking formalism – for
example: Eating with unwashed hands is a sin. If anyone swears by the altar, it means nothing;
but if anyone swears by the gift on it, he is bound by his oath.” (Mat 23:18 NIV84)
Now think about it for a moment. Jesus is in the temple, surrounded by all sorts of rituals – most
of which were commanded by God himself, although some were of human origin. This was the
center of the Jewish religion. Certainly the greatest command must be something like keeping the
Passover ordinance, or making sure that sacrificial offerings are perfect – without defect. The
Pharisees were zealous for such laws.
“The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord
is one. What a response! Let me explain (word by word) Jesus’ prelude to the greatest
commandment.
Hear, O Israel - listen very carefully to what I am about to say, O people graciously chosen
by God.
the LORD - the great “I am” who created the universe in six days, who revealed himself to
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, who performed wonders through Moses and gave great
promises of salvation. This LORD is not just a god, He is . . .
our God – whose Fatherly heart graciously chose to save us unworthy sinners from
eternity. The blood of his Son redeemed us from all sin and, by the work of his gracious
Spirit, he adopted us as his own. We belong to Him and He belongs to us.
the LORD is One: there is no one like him. He is the only God. He is the only LORD.
Because of who the LORD is and his saving relationship to us, it is only natural that the greatest
commandment of all is: Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and
with all your mind and with all your strength.’
What does God demand from us? Nothing less than our total love and commitment in response to
who He is. The Lord wants us to love him with every fiber of our being. Every thought in our mind
and desire of our heart, every choice we make and action we take ought to stem from our total love
for the Lord.
Let me explain this in another way: the Lord doesn’t demand that we try to fit Him into our busy
life. He demands that we fit our life into him! Every moment of every second of our life is to be
dedicated to him - remembering His word and fulfilling His will. Why? Not because we are afraid
of being punished if we don’t, but out of total love for who He is. This is the religion God not
only desires; it is the religion he rightfully demands.
But wait, there’s more: The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no
commandment greater than these.”
This second command is really an extension of the first. How so? Because the Scriptures clearly
indicate that one of the best ways we can show love to God is by loving our neighbor.
Now, understand this commandment correctly. We aren’t being commanded to “like” everyone.
God wants us to love everyone (including our enemies) with the same love we have for ourselves.
And how do we express love for ourselves? We feed, clothe, educate, nurture, encourage and pray
for ourselves. God wants us to express this very same love to others.
There you have it: all of God’s commands summarized in one word: love.
“Well said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God is one and there is no
other but him. 33 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your
strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and
sacrifices.”
This particular man got the point. Do we? Our sinful nature often tempts us to be like Pharisees:
that fulfilling outward forms like the act of coming to church, making offerings, how we pray, how
we worship, and that the performance of other traditions make us right with God when they
actually don’t.
Now don’t get me wrong, I am not saying that our religious traditions aren’t important. They are
very important. The Lord himself established many of the customs and rites of Old Testament
worship as a means of directing the attention of the worshipers to himself, his works, and his love.
This is also the purpose our customs and traditions have today. The problem is not the customs
themselves, but our failure to use them as means of directing our hearts to God. And when we
don’t offer our heart to God, we offer the sacrifice of Cain.
You remember the story of Cain and Abel, don’t you? Both were sons of Adam. Both offered
sacrifices to the Lord. God accepted Abel’s offering, but rejected Cain’s. Why? Because Cain did
not give his offering in faith. His heart was not on the Lord.
God himself says: I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and acknowledgment of God rather than burnt
offerings. (Hos 6:6 NIV84) The Scriputres also say: You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would
bring it; you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a
broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. (Psalm 51:16-17 NIV84)
Total, perfect love towards God and our fellow man: this is the religion God desires.
Understanding this truth put this particular Pharisee on the right path of salvation – as we read in
our text: When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not far from the
kingdom of God.”
You are not far from the kingdom of God? Why did Jesus say this? If the Pharisee understood that
true worship of God is all about love, wouldn’t that have placed him in the kingdom of God?
Not quite yet. There were two more steps for this Pharisee: 1) acknowledging and confessing that
we are completely incapable of loving God the way he demands. 2) looking in faith to the one who
showed perfect love to God and all humanity in order to save us from our sins.
Part Two: The perfect love Christ reveals.
Brothers and sisters in Christ - with the exception of Jesus - there is not a single person on this
earth who has or ever will love the Lord as perfectly as He demands.
And that’s really the point, isn’t it? God wants us to recognize our total sinfulness – that without
him we are loveless and lost. We need to be the objects of His divine love.
And, by God’s grace, that is exactly what we are: objects of God’s divine love! You know the
passage, so don’t be afraid to say it with me: “For God so loved the world that he gave his one
and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:16
NIV84)
Jesus himself is the fulfillment of God’s command to love. He showed perfect love to the Lord by
submitting to every aspect of His Father’s will for our salvation. Speaking about his coming
betrayal and crucifixion, Jesus once said to his disciples: the world must learn that I love the Father
and that I do exactly what my Father has commanded me. (John 14:31, NIV84)
Even though we lack the perfect love God requires, the LORD has made us the object of his divine
love, as the Holy Spirit inspired St. John to write: This is how God showed his love among us: He
sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we
loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins. (1 John 4:9-
10. NIV84)
Jesus lived the perfect life of love we all failed to live – thereby winning the righteousness we need
to be saved. Jesus also took our record of sin upon himself – suffering the punishment we deserved
for our lack of perfect love. Because of this we stand forgiven before God. Through faith in this
work we are saved.
But Christ’s perfect work doesn’t just stop at saving us - it also changes us. When the LORD
called us to repentance and faith, he didn’t just take away our sins, he created a new person in our
hearts – an attitude that truly desires to love God with its whole heart, soul mind and strength, and
to love its neighbor as itself. In view of God’s great love for us, St. Paul encourages us to live
according to the new man the Holy Spirit placed in our hearts. He writes: Be kind and
compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you. Be
imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children and live a life of love, just as Christ loved us
and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. (Ephesians 4:32 - 5:2,
NIV84).
Brothers and sisters in Christ: what is real religion all about? It’s all about the perfect love God
requires for himself and our neighbor, but that we, due to our sinfulness, are unable to express.
More importantly, however, true religion is all about the divine, saving love God expressed to us
in Christ, because of which we alone are saved, and through which we alone are enable to love
God and our fellow man with a true heart – all to the glory of Christ’s name. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",10/25/2015,
"Why do you give offerings to Church? Is it because God expects it of you? Is it because you are
afraid you’d get kicked out of the congregation if you didn’t? Is it so that you can feel good about
yourself?
I think it is important for every Christian to reflect on the reason why he or she gives an offering
to Church. Why? So that we don’t make an offering for the reasons I listed above! The LORD
hates those kinds of offerings. He wants our giving to reflect the love and trust we have in Him as
our God who loved us so much that He gave up His one and only Son to save us all.
Let us then, with the example of the poor widow as our guide, learn that Jesus loves offerings
that are. . . 1) given out of love, and 2) given in faith.
Part One: Jesus loves offerings that are given out of love.
Our sermon text takes place on the Wednesday before Jesus’ crucifixion. He had just spent
considerable time debating with the Pharisees, Sadducees and teachers of the law - warning the
crowd that gathered around him of their hypocrisy and greed.
After this: Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd
putting their money into the temple treasury. According to tradition, the temple had 13 trumpet
shaped chests placed around the women’s court. Nine of these chests were to receive offerings
required by the Mosaic law. The other four were strictly for voluntary gifts. Our text seems to
indicate that Jesus seated himself next to one of these free-will offering chests.
Jesus was keenly interested in what and how the people were offering. We can almost sense His
omniscient gaze into the heart of every worshiper – seeing not only what he put into the chest, but
why he put it there. Were these voluntary gifts given out of genuine love for the LORD or were
they merely a hypocritical show of piety? Jesus knew the answer.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, Jesus once said: “where two or three come together in my name,
there am I with them."" (Mat 18:20 NIV84) Just as he was with his disciples in the temple, so he is
with us now; watching our worship and offerings with keen interest - searching our hands, mouths
and hearts for genuine faith and love in him above all things.
In the temple Jesus saw: Many rich people, [who] threw in large amounts. I want to pause here
for a moment, and say something positive about the Jews: it doesn’t seem as if they gave the bare
minimum required by the law. No, the Jews were happy to offer more to the LORD. Yes, it is true
that many of them did it merely to make a show; and there were most likely those who tried to buy
God’s favor. Such offerings are sinful.
But notice that Jesus does not condemn the offerings of the rich in our sermon text, rather he places
them in contrast with the far greater offering made by the poor widow – holding it as exemplary.
This seems to indicate that there were some Jews who made offerings with the proper heart
(namely out of love for their LORD) but not to the degree of faith that the widow had.
Yes, there are times we can learn from the generosity of the Jews, who, at the time of Moses,
treasured God’s house so much, that they had to be prevented from giving any more money and
goods because that had already given so much! Oh that we would all have such a love for the
LORD and his house.
Part Two: Jesus loves offerings that are given in faith.
We read: But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a fraction of
a penny.
It seems as if no one other than Jesus noticed this poor widow, and yet she is definitely worthy of
note. The fact that she carried around her entire life savings, seems to indicate that she had a tough
life with few relatives to help. No one would’ve blamed her if she had joined the ranks of beggars
in the temple court. She needed money. But, moved by the Lord’s promises, instead of begging
for money, she made an offering of it – not because she felt like she was going to get kicked out
of the temple if she didn’t, nor because she thought that God demanded it of her, nor to earn God’s
favor. No, she offered her two coins simply because she loved her Lord and trusted in his promise
to forgive all her sins and provide all she needed in life.
Sadly there are some people who question whether or not the widow’s sacrifice was all that great
because our Bible says that the coins were worth only a fraction of a penny. What else could she
do with so little money?
Actually, the money she gave was worth much more than a current US penny. It would’ve been
enough to buy a couple eggs, milk or small pieces of bread. What she offered the Lord was her
last meal – much like the widow of Zeraphath when she used her little flour and oil to feed Elijah.
And so: Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more
into the treasury than all the others. 
Mark well what Jesus is telling his disciples: The small, insignificant offering made by this
widow was more important than all the wealth of all the offerings given at the temple that day.
Why? Jesus tells us:
They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live
on.”
The phrase “they all gave out of their wealth” seems to indicate that the money the other people
offered was all money they didn’t really need. This woman, however, really needed the money she
gave. It was a true sacrifice given out of love and faith in the Lord. Her offering was a testimony
to the words Jesus spoke during his sermon on the Mount: So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we
eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these things,
and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his
righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. (Mat 6:31-33 NIV84)
“'What shall we eat? 'What shall we drink? What shall we wear?” – these are the questions the
Jews ask themselves before they went to the temple; and didn’t we ask ourselves the same
questions before we came to church today? And don’t we try to answer these questions before we
choose an offering to give to our LORD?
But that’s backwards. Our first priority ought to be the Lord. Why? Because all that we have and
are comes from him, as we confess in Luther’s explanation of the First Article of the Apostles
Creed: I believe that God still preserves me by richly and daily providing clothing and shoes, food
and drink, property and home, spouse and children, land, cattle, and all I own, and all I need to
keep my body and life.
The Lord not only saved us from our sins, he also sustains us by providing everything we need for
our bodily life. The widow's offering proves that she believed this fact. Do the offerings we give
to the Lord reveals such a faith in our heart?
The Lord once said: ""If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross
and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will
find it. (Mat 16:24-25 NIV84) Don’t you see the widow doing exactly what Jesus described? She
is denying herself her goods, taking up her cross of poverty, and following Christ’s promises in
faith. This poor, widow is willing to lose her earthly life for her faith, but, by means of the faith
she expressed with her offering, instead of losing her life, she found true eternal life in the Lord.
What happened to the widow after she made this offering? Did the Lord shower money down upon
her from heaven? Probably not. I can imagine her remaining poor through out her earthly life. I
can imagine that it was full of hardship and struggle. But I know for a fact that the Lord was with
her – giving her all she needed to sustain her earthly life, and finally delivering her soul home to
himself in heaven. There she is rich beyond measure. Why? All because of Christ’s sacrifice for
her. All because of her faith which trusted in it.
Having meditated on the widow's offering, let us again ask ourselves: why do we give what we
give to the Lord? Now, please understand the purpose of this question correctly. I am not asking 
it in order to get more money in the offering plate. My greater concern is what is in our hearts. Do
we, as the first commandment says, truly fear, love and trust in the Lord above all things? If we
do, our actions – yes, even our giving - will show it.
But it’s hard, isn’t it? It’s hard to trust that the Lord will take care of every aspect of our life to
such a degree that we don’t have to worry. It’s hard giving money to church, when we are saving
for something we really want. So I would venture to guess that none of us [myself included] have
the faith of this widow, who gave everything she had to the LORD. Like the rest of the Jews, most
of us give from our excess - offering the money we don’t need - in weakness of faith.
But how can we change this? How can we strengthen our faith to such a degree that we may live
and give as fearlessly as the poor widow did in the temple? The answer is this: meditate on God’s
promises while keeping your eyes fixed on the cross. And what will you see when you do this?
You will see your God who loves you so much, that He sent His one and only Son to suffer and
die for your sins so that you might live with him for ever in heaven. And if God, as St. Paul says,
did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him,
graciously give us all things? (Romans 8:32, NIV84)
Yes, as you meditate on the Scriptures through Christ’s cross, you will see how God kept every
promise He made – always providing everything that his dearly loved believers needed in order to
deliver them safely through this earthly life to himself in heaven. No, their life wasn’t always
easy, but He was with them through it all – keeping his promises and glorifying his name.
Meditating on these facts strengthens our faith. It convinces us that our security and happiness is
not found in how much money we have and what we do for ourselves, it’s found in Christ alone.
Faith in this truth moves us to action. It not only makes us willing to give, it moves us to act – to
boldly sacrifice the wealth God has given us – trusting that He will keep his promises and provide
for our every need.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: No matter what the amount, Jesus loves offerings that are given to
him out of love for who He is and what He has done, and in the faith that He will provide all that
we need. May the LORD increase our faith that it becomes like that of the poor widow who
demonstrated her fear, love and trust in God by offering everything she had to the LORD with the
faith that He would take care her. God is pleased by such a faith – blessing the person who shows
it. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",10/11/2015,
"Imagine this situation: a husband and wife - married, but unhappy. They put on a good show but don’t love
each other anymore. All they do is argue. They rarely spend time together. They think: maybe getting
married was a mistake. Maybe it would be best to get a divorce and just be good friends. Isn’t it better to
live a happy life, than to be trapped in a loveless marriage? And so the couple starts thinking about filing
for divorce based on irreconcilable differences.
At first glance we might be tempted to think: “Well, I get it. I can just imagine how hard it would be to
spend your life together with someone you don’t really love. It probably would be better to just end the
marriage than to go on.” This is what our sinful human heart thinks, which is driven by selfish motives
and passions.
But, as Christians, we are not controlled by our sinful passions. We belong to Christ -so the real question
we have to ask ourselves is: What does Jesus think about Divorce? With the Gospel of Mark as our
guide, let us learn that 1) Jesus doesn’t want us to view marriage and divorce the way the world does. 2)
Jesus wants us to know what marriage actually is. 3) Jesus wants us to understand that divorce is, in
essence, a sin.
Part One: Jesus doesn’t want us to view marriage and divorce the way the world does.
Our sermon text finds Jesus teaching a crowd of people in a region near Judea but still under the control of
Herod.
We read:
2 The Pharisees came and asked Him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”
Now at first glance this question might seem innocent enough. Even the disciples were interested in what
Jesus had to say concerning this matter. But there was more to the question than first meets the ear. Mark
tells us that, in asking Jesus this question, the Pharisees were testing Him.
As I just mentioned, Jesus was in the area ruled by Herod Antipas, who, as the beheading of John the
Baptist’s illustrates, did not take kindly to people who criticized his divorce and remarriage. On top of this,
if Jesus spoke out against divorce – which the Pharisees expected him to do - he would probably lose
popularity points with the people.
But Jesus wasn’t afraid of losing popularity. He was more concerned that people know the truth, and this
is why he responded:
“What did Moses command you?” They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce,
and to dismiss her.”
The Pharisees had the first few verses of Deuteronomy 24 in mind, which talk about a man writing a
certificate of divorce if his wife loses favor in his eyes because he finds something indecent or unclean
about her. Many Jews interpreted this passage rather liberally: allowing trivial things, like being a bad cook,
to be a cause for divorce.
You see then that the Pharisees (like the rest of the world) viewed marriage from a purely selfish view
point. To them, marriage was merely a human arrangement, and they were more interested in what they
could get out of it than the love they could offer. And if their “needs” or “desires” weren’t being fulfilled,
they looked for a way out - and Moses' instruction concerning a certificate of divorce seemed to provide
just that.
But an honest reading of Deuteronomy 24 shows that God did not command this provision as a way people
could “get out” of their marriages, but as a way to regulate and protect people from the sinful behavior of
others.
You see, if a man divorced his wife, it would automatically be assumed that it was for adultery. The written
certificate, however, gave the legal reason for the divorce – thereby offering some protection to the innocent
so that they would not be stigmatized as adulterers. This is why Jesus said: “Because of the hardness of
your heart he wrote you this precept.”
Jesus was, in effect, saying: “God is not allowing divorce in this passage, rather, knowing that you would
selfishly pursue divorce in spite of the fact that it goes against his will, God regulated it so as to lessen the
devastating effects it would have on the innocent party.”
The Scriptures are clear: God hates divorce.i
 Why? Because God does not view marriage as a mere human
arrangement between two consenting adults – and neither should we! As we will learn next, every marriage
is God’s gracious work – bringing a man and a woman together to accomplish His will.
Part Two: Jesus wants us to know what marriage actually is.
Jesus continues: But from the beginning of the creation, God ‘made them male and female.’ For this reason
a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’; so
then they are no longer two, but one flesh.
Our society only views marriage as a human arrangement in which people can fulfill their selfish passions.
Now, I will say this: if this were true, then I could say nothing against homosexual marriage. But marriage
is not a human arrangement. God instituted marriage at creation – creating us male and female so that each
individual man might be united to the one woman created to complement him in order that they, together,
might bring glory to God’s name. Homosexual marriage, therefore, is a perversion of God’s purpose and
institution of marriage. It is wrong!
Marriage is also not a way for a man to get a personal slave who will fulfill his every whim. It is not a
means for a woman to get a “sugar daddy” who will support her lust for material things. God made humans 
male and female – not merely so that they could have sex and procreate. No, he created us for marriage.
And what is marriage?
It is when a man and woman leave the former family bonds into which they were born so that they might
form something new together – making a life-long commitment of love to each other. They are joined
together emotionally and spiritually to such a degree that they become as one. What does that mean? It
means that they no longer live selfishly – each for themselves. They live for each other. They live as one.
Just as your head makes decisions that benefit your body, so the husband is to live for his wife; and just as
your body supports your head, so the wife is to support her husband. I know that my illustration sounds a
little absurd because no one ever thinks of the head and body operating separately from each other – but
that is exactly the point Scripture makes concerning marriage: God desires that husband and wife be so
united in a bond of love and commitment that it would be absolutely absurd for one to operate
independently of the other.
Marriage, therefore, is not about what I get and how I feel, but its about how I – as a man –can love and
benefit my wife; and how my wife – as a woman – can help and support me. Together we work and live to
glorify God until death do us part.
The LORD never promised anyone an easy life in this wicked world. Because of sin, there will always be
conflict. My sinful nature will constantly attempt to flare up – trying to live selfishly, and wreak havoc on
my marriage. My wife’s sinful nature will do the same. Christians acknowledge this fact. They realize that
there will be times when they don’t feel like they love their spouse. But when those times come, the
Christian will go to Christ in prayer and ask for his help – remembering that their marriage (as difficult as
things may seem) is from God. He brought them together to serve his purpose, to glorify his name. He
will, therefore, send his Spirit to help them bear their crosses and bring relief and resolution is his good
time.
Marriage is God’s work. He brings a man and a woman together in a bond of love to accomplish his will.
Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.
Part Three: Jesus wants us to understand that divorce is, in essence, a sin.
Now what I said about marriage and divorce might have come as a bit of a shock to you. Maybe you never
really thought of marriage as more than a human institution. Maybe you wondered if divorce really is that
bad. If you are wondering these things, you are not alone. Even Jesus' own disciples needed clarification.
We read: In the house His disciples also asked Him again about the same matter.
11 So He said to them,
“Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. 12 And if a woman divorces
her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”
Is divorce really that bad? Yes, it is. To divorce someone merely because you can’t seem to get along or
because you feel like you would be better off with another person, is a sin. Whoever divorces his/her spouse
and marries another is committing adultery and, as the Scriptures say: Neither the sexually immoral nor
idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders . . . will inherit the kingdom of
God.ii
Jesus is clear: divorce is a sin. HOWEVER, before we leave this point we have to be clear on what divorce
is and why it is a sin. When we think of divorce, we think of the person filing the papers to officially
dissolve the marriage in the eyes of the state. God views it differently.
Let me explain what I mean with two illustrations: A wife cheats on her husband and he files for divorce. 
Even though he is the one filing the paper work, God will hold the wife accountable for the divorce because
she, by her actions, broke the marriage bond. If a man emotionally abuses his wife– driving her to divorce
him – he is the one who, by his actions, broke the marriage bond. God will hold him accountable for the
divorce, not her.
The point I am trying to make is this: God hates divorce, but the person he holds accountable is not
necessarily the one filing the papers. God searches the heart – knowing every sinful, selfish motive lurking
therein. Whoever willfully refuses to fulfill their role in marriage breaks the marriage bond by breaking
his or her promise. If a divorce results because of it, God will hold that person accountable.
As we close this section on divorce, there is one more thing I need to say. Yes, Jesus’ teaching is clear:
divorce is a serious sin that puts a person under God’s wrath. But as you hear Jesus speak this truth,
remember also who he is: the dear Lamb of God, who came to be sacrificed on the cross for the sins of the
world. The LORD laid upon him the iniquity of us all – including the iniquity of sinful divorce or any other
way we may have broken our marriage bonds. Jesus died so that, whoever looks to him in true repentance
and faith might be forgiven of all sin. Therefore, if you are divorced and are worried that you may have
been at fault, then look to the cross and repent - confessing your sins to Christ. He is merciful and just –
promising to forgive all our sins and to purify us from all unrighteousness.
Yes, brothers and sisters in Christ, look to the cross. Jesus' love for us not only forgives our sins, it is also
the power behind every Christian marriage. Jesus' love for me is the power behind my love for my wife –
just as I know it is the power behind her love for me. Jesus’ love helps us keep our marriage in its proper
perspective. It moves us to forgive each other just as he forgave us. And, as we view the cross together –
Jesus' love for us strengthens our bond to each other – making marriage the wonderful blessing God created
it to be. All to the glory of his name. Amen.
",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",10/4/2015,
"What do you think of when you hear the term greatness? Do you imagine a CEO like Steve Jobs and what
he did for a company like Apple? Or do you think of a struggling, single mom – who can barely make ends
meet - doing all she can so that her child might receive a Christian education? Do you imagine an athlete
like Aaron Rogers and what he can do on the football field? Or do you picture a father taking time to help
his son or daughter study the catechism?
“Greatness,” in the eyes of the world, is making a name for yourself – being powerful, popular and
persuasive. We are told to admire people who achieve the goals they set for themselves and emulate their
example in our own lives.
But this is not the path to true greatness in the eyes of God. Our self-accomplishments not only mean
nothing to him, but, when mixed with pride, they are actually offensive. True greatness has nothing to do
with making a name for ourselves, but has everything to do with glorifying God’s name. True greatness is
not found in fulfilling our dreams, but in addressing the real needs of others – making them the beneficiaries
of our work and God the object of all glory.
With Jesus as our guide, let us consider these things, under the theme: True greatness. . . 1) Is hidden
from man, 2) Is revealed in our Savior.
Part One: True Greatness is hidden from man.
Our sermon text takes place after Jesus revealed his glory on the Mount of Transfiguration and his power
by healing a demon possessed boy. Shortly after those events, Jesus and his disciples left that place and
passed through Galilee. Where were they going? Ultimately Jerusalem, but on this particular day they
only made it as far as Capernaum. They took a secluded route. Why? Our text says that Jesus did not want
anyone to know where they were, because he was teaching his disciples.
Jesus knew that the time of his sacrifice was fast approaching, and he needed his disciples to be prepared.
He didn’t want them to lose heart or despair because of the events surrounding his crucifixion, but to look
forward to his resurrection in faith.
He said to them, ""The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men. They will kill him, and
after three days he will rise.""
This is the second time Scripture records Jesus trying to explain the events of Holy Week in detail to his
disciples. Jesus wanted them to listen to his instruction and – as hard as it was - accept it. His teaching of
the cross was essential for them to understand what kind of Christ He is. Jesus was not some earthly king
who would overthrow the Romans. No, he was the great “Son of Man” – the glorious prince of heaven that
the Prophet Daniel foresaw in a vision receiving all authority over all creationi
. But Jesus would only
receive this glory after He won salvation for us as God’s suffering servant, who (in the words of Isaiah)
would be pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us
peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed.ii
How did the disciples receive this instruction? We read: But they did not understand what he meant and
were afraid to ask him about it.
Oh these poor blind disciples! How could they let Jesus’ important words escape their hearts? To be fair,
we have the privilege of looking back at the events of Holy Week – knowing what was all accomplished.
I don’t think any of us can truly understand the shock and horror the disciples felt when Jesus spoke about
his end. No one had ever raised himself from the dead before and crucifixion was an utterly shameful and
terrible way to die. On top of this, Jesus was the Messiah. If He died, so would all their dreams of glory.
The disciples probably thought, “No, there must be some other explanation or meaning. What Jesus said
can’t be right, so it’s best not to think about it.”
And so the disciples were silent - afraid to ask Jesus about his teaching because he might tell them
something they didn’t want to hear. They let their thoughts wander to other, worldly things centered in their
own misguided imagination of Christ’s glorious reign and the positions of honor they would occupy in it.
And this led them to discuss among themselves who would be greatest in the kingdom.
Brothers and sisters in Christ: note well how the disciples were so blinded by their worldly understanding
of Christ kingdom and the glory it would entail, that they failed to listen to Jesus when He explained to
them the true nature of his kingdom and wherein its true glory lay.
But let me ask you: is it any different with us? Like the disciples we all have our preconceived notions as
to what God’s kingdom (Christ’s Church) ought to be like. Our flesh desires a comfortable, easy and
glorious discipleship, and a Messiah whom we don’t have to be ashamed of before the world. But then we
hear Jesus say something that goes against our preconceived notions of how things should be: something
like God's teaching on the roles of man and woman, God’s will concerning church fellowship, Christian
suffering, or similar difficult doctrines. Those teachings make us uneasy. We don’t want to think about or
study them because we are afraid of what we might learn. We don’t want our ideas about how things should
be shattered, so we change the subject – thinking about worldly things that make us feel good.
Like the disciples, we sin when we do this. Thankfully the LORD is patient with us – just as he was with
the disciples. And, when the opportunity is right, he confronts our thoughts with His Word, ready to
teach us truth about his kingdom and wherein the glory of being his disciple lies.
Part Two: True Greatness is revealed in our Savior.
They came to Capernaum. When he was in the house, he asked them, ""What were you arguing about on the
road?"" 34 But they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest. 
Sometimes it isn’t until we are openly confronted with our thoughts that we realize how foolish they are.
This was certainly the case with the disciples. Just think: Jesus, their Rabbi, was talking about his
impending betrayal, death and resurrection and they were arguing who is greatest among them? Is it any
wonder that they didn’t want to tell Jesus what they were discussing? But, from what we know from the
other Gospels, it seems as if Jesus kept pressing until one of them finally said: ""Who is the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven?""iii
Now that the question was out in the open, Jesus could address it for all to hear. Sitting down, (this was a
position Rabbis took in those days when they were about to teach a lesson) Jesus called the Twelve and
said, ""If anyone wants to be first, he must be the very last, and the servant of all.""
Oh, how different are Christ’s words from the ideas of man. The world tells us that if you want to be great,
you have to relentlessly pursue your own goals – realizing that you might have to step on a few toes to get
ahead. But Jesus tells us something different: true greatness has nothing to do with selfish self-fulfillment.
No, greatness before God is all about loving others out of love for Him. It’s found in putting the needs and
welfare of others ahead of your own. God wants every Christian to pursue this kind of greatness, as St Paul
wrote in his letter to the Philippians: 3 Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility
consider others better than yourselves. 4 Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to
the interests of others. 5 Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus: 6 Who, being in very
nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped, 7
but made himself nothing, taking
the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. 8 And being found in appearance as a man, he
humbled himself and became obedient to death-- even death on a cross! 9 Therefore God exalted him to the
highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee
should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, 11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the glory of God the Father.iv
Yes, Jesus humbling himself to earn our redemption is the embodiment of divine greatness - a greatness
that saved and adopted underserving, sinful wretches like us into His heavenly kingdom. We have become
God’s children through faith, and as such, Jesus wants us to pursue the greatness He pursued – the greatness
of welcoming even the least of his children and serving them in love, as Jesus’ action illustrates: He took
a little child and had him stand among them. Taking him in his arms, he said to them, 37 ""Whoever welcomes
one of these little children in my name welcomes me; and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but
the one who sent me.""
Can you picture the tender scene? Jesus calling a little child to himself in front of all the disciples, and,
when the child comes, Jesus picks it up and gives it a tender hug. The point is clear: Jesus loves children.
He is not too busy for them – considering them unimportant.
Yes, the point is clear: Jesus loves children, and He wants us to love them too.
Greatness is not found in being surrounded by important people who are bent on serving you. Rather it is
found in being surrounded by all the people in whom the world finds little value – like children and the
simple – and welcoming them in Christ’s name by witnessing Christ’s love to them in both our words and
actions. Doing such things is greater in God’s eyes than being a famous CEO, politician or sports star.
And so, dear brothers and sisters in Christ, let us learn to pursue true greatness: seeing Christ in every soul
we meet, and loving them as we would love our Savior. Do you want to be great in God’s kingdom? Then
look for ways to serve God’s little lambs by teaching Sunday School or helping with VBS. Ask me who 
the sick and shut in are and visit them. Find out if there is anybody in Confirmation whom you can tutor.
Look for ways to encourage parents to send their children to our Christian schools in Algoma and
Manitowoc. Choose to spend time with those whom others may consider strange or unpopular –
encouraging them with your prayers and simple witness of the Gospel with your words and actions.
Denying ourselves to serve others out of love for Christ: this is what true greatness is all about. Sadly, this
is also a greatness that all of us, by nature, have failed to pursue. For this we ought to repent – looking to
Jesus for forgiveness and help. And Jesus freely grants us forgiveness and help. Through his suffering
death and resurrection, He redeemed us from all sin. Through the preaching of the Gospel He welcomed
us into is kingdom. We belong to him. Let us then, in the peace of Christ’s forgiveness, ask Jesus to send
us the Holy Spirit so that we might freely love and welcome others into fellowship with us, just as He has
freely loved and welcomed us into fellowship with Him. Amen. ",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",9/27/2015,
"Picture three plants in front of you: one is covered with beautiful green leaves and brightly colored
flowers; the next has a few green leaves but also quite a few brown branches; and the last one is
all shriveled up and dry. What assessment would you make concerning these three plants? The
first one is very much alive and well. The second is sick and needs immediate attention. The third
plant is dead and should probably be composted.
Christians can be compared to these plants. There are three types: There are those who are alive
and active in their faith. Like a healthy tree, they naturally produce an abundance of spiritual fruit.
Then there are those Christians who, by their fruit, you can tell are struggling in their faith. They
need special, Gospel care and attention to strengthen them. Then there are those Christians who
produce no spiritual fruit at all. Their faith is withered and dead.
The fruits of faith are good works. No, good works don’t make a person a Christian any more than
colorful flower petals and green leaves produce a cherry tree. However, just as a cherry tree will
naturally produce beautiful flower petals and leaves in the spring, so also a believing Christian will
produce the fruit of good works.
With the epistle writer James as our guide, let us learn about the importance of good works - from
where they come and what they reveal about our faith - under the theme: Faith without works is
dead! 1) Worthless is the faith that doesn’t act. 2) Priceless is the faith that does act.
Part One: Worthless is the faith that doesn’t act (14-20)
Many people say they have faith in God - even when their lives are at variance with their claim.
They might say: “Just because I never go to church, doesn’t mean that I don’t believe in Jesus. I
pray to him all the time.” You might also hear someone say: “God is love. He accepts me as I
am; unlike you people who seem to be constantly judging my lifestyle.”
Yes, the “God is love so no one can tell me what to do” type of Christianity is very popular today
- not only outside these Church walls, but, even within them. Even within this body of mine, the
devil and my sinful flesh work hard at tempting me to “pick and choose” what to believe and how
to act rather than simply believing all of God’s Word and doing what it says.
This is why James asks the important question: What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to
have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?
Now, good Lutherans that we are, we all know the Bible passage that says: it is by grace you have
been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that
no one can boast. (Eph 2:8-9 NIV84). The Bible is crystal clear on this point: no one is declared
righteous by observing the law. Our deeds and works can never save us. And why not? Because
even our best works are tainted with sin. The law is not a way to earn our salvation, but a means
by which our sins are revealed to us. For what purpose? So that we might see our inability to save
ourselves and look to Jesus alone for our salvation.
Jesus has saved us. When He died on the cross, he died for the sins of the whole world - paying
for them in full. The only reason you and I can go to heaven is because of this fact. And the only
way we receive the benefit of Christ’s sacrifice is through faith alone, and not by works, as the
Scriptures say: For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law.
(Rom 3:28 NIV84)
There you have it: faith alone saves. But here is something else to consider: faith is never alone -
it is always accompanied by works. Why? Because, as the Scriptures say, God saved us for a
purpose: that we might, as his dearly loved children, be eager to do what is good. (cf. Tit 2:14
NIV84). St. Paul says so much, when He writes: For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. (Eph 2:10 NIV84)
So this leads back to the question: if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith
save him?
Faith alone saves, but faith is never alone. Think of it this way: have you ever seen the wind? I
haven’t. But I can perceive the effects of the wind by observing the rustling leaves and bending
branches. Now imagine someone said to you that it is very windy outside, but as you look at the
window, not a single leaf is moving. Is what he says true? No.
And neither is it true when someone says: “I have faith,” (something I can’t see) but the effects of
his faith (his deeds, which I can perceive) are utterly absent.
Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, ""Go, I
wish you well; keep warm and well fed,"" but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is
it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
Mere words, if they are not followed up with action, are just that: mere words. It doesn’t matter
how much we say we love somebody; if we don’t follow it up with our actions, we show that love
is absent from our heart.
And this is what hypocrisy is all about: claiming to feel something we don’t, or to be someone we
aren’t. Christianity is not merely a matter of words, but a matter of the heart. The faith God has
planted in our hearts through the Gospel changes us. We have been given a new spirit - one that
desires to love as Christ has loved us. It is only natural for the Christian to want to show love to
God and his neighbor. And if a person refuses to show such love? Well, listen to what another
apostle wrote about that: If anyone says, ""I love God,"" yet hates his brother, he is a liar. For anyone
who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not seen. (1Jo
4:20 NIV84)
St. James continues: But someone will say, ""You have faith; I have deeds.”
Having addressed those people who claim to have “faith” and yet do not show it in their actions,
James now addresses those who claim that that their actions will save them even though they have
no faith.
You hear this kind of religion all the time - especially at funerals. People say: “So and so was such
a good person, they deserve to be in heaven” - even though that person didn’t actually express any
sort of faith in Jesus whatsoever. Such a theology makes “salvation” a byproduct of “good works”.
But salvation is definitely not the result of living a good life. Salvation comes by faith alone: a
God-given faith that will naturally express itself through what it does. This is why St. James
says: Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do.
Neither faith without deeds nor deeds without faith are pleasing to God. Just as a plant produces
a flower and not the other way around, so also the only works that please God proceed from a
heart that believes in Him, as the Scriptures says: “without faith it is impossible to please God,
(Hebrews 11:6 NIV84)” and again, “everything that does not come from faith is sin.” (Romans
14:23 NIV84)
St. James continues: You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that--
and shudder.
The point is clear: merely believing that “god” exists doesn’t save a person either. The only faith
that saves is faith that is placed in Christ. Such a faith will lead us to recognize who the true God
is and what he demands in His law. It will lead us to see our sins and cry out for mercy, repenting
of them all! Such a faith will trust God’s promise that He forgives us for Christ sake - that all our
sins have been paid for in full through his sacrifice on the cross. We are at peace with God. And
in the peace of this salvation - having been declared free and forgiven of all sin - we will naturally
want to live to God’s glory - showing forth faith and love for him in all our actions.
Part Two: Priceless is the faith that does act.
And so, St. James continues: You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is
useless? Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his
son Isaac on the altar? You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith
was made complete by what he did. And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ""Abraham believed
God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,"" and he was called God's friend.
Abraham is an excellent example both of how faith alone saves, and how faith is never alone. The
Scriptures are clear: Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness. Faith in
God’s promise of a Savior alone saved Abraham’s soul.
The LORD was Abraham’s God. Abraham trusted in all of God’s promises. How do we know
that Abraham had such a faith in the LORD? His willingness to sacrifice Isaac at God’s command
proves it - so much so that the LORD himself had to prevent Abraham from going through with
the deed, saying: ""Do not lay a hand on the boy . . .Do not do anything to him. Now I know that
you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son."" (Gen 22:12
NIV84).
From this example St. James deduces: You see that a person is justified by what he does and not
by faith alone.
Don’t miss understand this verse to mean: Abraham’s actions saved him by earning favor with
God. The Scriptures never say that! No, what this verse means, rather, is that Abraham’s actions
“justified” him in the sense that this willingness to sacrifice his son publicly revealed that his faith
was genuine, and not fake.
In this same way our deeds “justify” us before the world: they are the evidence of whether or not
our faith in genuine or fake, of whether or not the LORD truly is our God whom we fear, love and
trust above all things.
James quotes another example: In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered
righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different
direction? When the spies that Joshua sent to Jericho were discovered, Rahab hid and saved
them. Why? Because she heard the reports about how the LORD led Israel through the wilderness,
and why they had come. She believed that God would do for Israel everything He said He would
do, and this faith compelled her to act - trusting that the LORD would show her mercy. Rahab’s
faith saved her by exhibiting itself in what she did.
And so, St James concludes: As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, do you now understand the importance of both faith and works?
Faith alone saves, but genuine faith is never alone. Just as, in the fall, an apple tree will produce
apples, so also the Christian who is declared righteous by faith will show forth fruits of
righteousness in his life as He prayerfully lives to the glory of His heavenly Father, who adopted
him into His family.
No, we will never be perfect in this life, but we are forgiven through faith in Christ’s work for us.
In the peace of this forgiveness, therefore, let us strive to please our heavenly father - letting our
faith shine forth in this dark world through our actions so that people “may see your good deeds
and praise your Father in heaven” (Mat 5:16 NIV84). It is for this noble purpose that we have
been saved: that our faith-driven acts might glorify God by witnessing Christ’s saving love to the
world. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",9/20/2015,
"Parents: I don’t know whether or not you realize it, but you did a beautiful thing today – and for this I praise
God.
I know the choice you had this morning. You could have stayed in bed a little longer, but you didn’t. You
got up, got dressed and brought your children here. Why? Because you want your children to know their
Savior!
But don’t stop at merely dropping your children off at Sunday School, come yourself to worship and the
new Bible Class we will offer during the Sunday School hour. Why? Because we too are God’s children
whom he wants to instruct, hold and bless. Let us consider this truth under the theme: Let the Children
Come to Christ. 1) Our little ones, whom we bring. 2) God’s little ones, whom we are.
Part One: Our little ones, whom we bring.
Our sermon text takes place during the final stages of Jesus’ earthly ministry before his crucifixion. He
was in Judea and, after a run in with some Pharisees on the topic of divorce, He retired to a house where
the disciples tried to continue the discussion.
Jesus was at the height of his popularity at this time. Therefore, when parents and grandparents heard that
He was in town, they started bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them.
Just picture the beautiful scene: Daddies holding their daughters’ hands and mommies carrying their infant
sons – a little train of families coming to Jesus that he might lay his hand on their children in blessing. This
scene is more than just beautiful, it is praiseworthy! The parents did a wonderful thing in seeking Christ’s
blessing for their children.
Oh that all mothers and fathers of today would take this example to heart and imitate it! All too often
parents drive their children to all sorts of clubs and sports; but when it comes to bringing their children to
worship? Somehow they lack the time. All too often parents have the money to buy their kids all sorts of
gadgets, toys and experiences; but when it comes to spending money for their children’s Christian
education? Somehow they lack the funds.
Let’s be honest: it’s not about a lack of funds or time because, as the English proverb goes, “where there’s
a will, there’s a way.” No, the problem is that many parents lack zeal. They have lost the recognition of
the importance of Christian education – viewing it from a worldly point of view (as yet another thing I 
would need to add to my already busy calendar) instead of what it truly is: bringing our children to Christ
to place in his arms in order to receive his blessing of forgiveness, life and salvation! What could be more
important or more beautiful than that!
Yes, the train of parents bringing their children to Jesus was a wonderful sight to behold; one that the devil
tried hard to prevent; as we read: but the disciples rebuked them.
Why did the disciples rebuke these families coming to Christ? We don’t know for sure. Perhaps it was
because they wanted some alone time with Jesus. Maybe they felt he needed rest. Perhaps they felt that
Jesus' ministry was far too important than to deal with “children.” Regardless of their reasoning, they did
a wicked thing when they berated the parents who brought their children to Jesus!
I am sure that the disciples didn’t mean it, but they had become agents of Satan: driving people away from
Christ instead of bringing them to him. Can the same thing happen to us? It sure can! I once heard a story
of how a group of parishioners asked their pastor to do something about all the crying children in worship.
They wanted him to encourage parents to keep them out of the sanctuary during the service. I don’t think
they realized the danger of their request, but the pastor did. This is why he disregarded their request
outright, telling them: “I would rather hear these children crying in worship now than crying in hell later!”
Just like the disciples, we all have preconceived notions of what the kingdom of God should be like and, if
some person in our group threatens those preconceived notions, we are tempted to criticize them, instead
of turning to Christ and seeing from Scripture whom he wants His kingdom to be like. We might think that
we are protecting Christ’s honor when, in fact, we are merely protecting our own comfort level.
But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant. He called the disciples to himself and told them quite forcefully:
“Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as
these.
Even though we can learn a lot from Jesus' rebuke, let us meditate on the obvious: Jesus loves children and
wants them to be with him. He knows that all people are born sinful – needing his mercy and grace.
Children are no exception to this truth, and this is why Jesus so earnestly desires them to come and receive
the forgiveness He won for them.
So, let the little children come to Jesus. And where do they find Jesus? In his Word! Do not hinder them
from hearing, seeing and singing about all the wonderful stories about Christ. Having inherited a sinful
nature from their parents, children need to hear the Gospel every bit as much as adults. They need to be
reassured of His love and forgiveness. Why? So that they might become God’s children and heirs of eternal
life.
“But,” someone might say, “since my child is an infant, it is too young to understand the word. What’s the
point of bringing them to church or reading the Bible to them now?” Let me respond to that question with
a Bible verse – something Paul wrote to a young man named Timothy. He said to him: from infancy you
have known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
Did you catch that? Timothy had saving faith in the holy Bible from infancy – that is, before He could even
reason or talk! How is that possible? That I don’t know – it is a miracle of God! But how this faith came
about I can tell you: his mother Eunice and grandmother Lois spoke the Gospel with him from the time He
was born – and the Holy Spirit worked through their witness to somehow both awaken and strengthen
saving faith in his infant heart. Through their words, prayers and songs they continually brought baby
Timothy to Jesus, and Jesus blessed him.
Jesus loves it when we bring our children to him as well. He gives us the means of Holy Baptism (something
Lois and Eunice did not have) as a real and tangible way we can present our children to Christ to receive
his blessings. And once the Spirit works the miracle of faith in their hearts through this sacrament, God
wants us to continually bring our children to Jesus just like Timothy’s mother and grandmother did for him
by sharing the Scriptures with them at home, bringing them to Sunday School and worship, and by allowing
them to have a Christian education at our school in Algoma.
Let us not become agents of Satan by inadvertently hindering our children from hearing the Gospel because
we are too busy to take the time to bring them to Christ. Let us, rather, see the great blessing Jesus offers
us and our children through the Gospel - ever eager to receive it ourselves.
Part Two: God’s little ones, whom we are.
Jesus said: “Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to
such as these.
What is the kingdom of God? It is Christ’s gracious rule in the heart. To be in God’s kingdom is the same
as being a believer. It means being in a right relationship with God, one in which we are not afraid of Him
because our sins have been forgiven in Christ. To be in God’s kingdom means that we are God’s children
by faith – children who love God and want to show our love towards him by living our lives to his glory.
The kingdom of God, eternal salvation with Christ, belongs only to people who receive it like children.
What does that mean? How do children receive the kingdom of God as opposed to adults?
Children, in Jesus’ time, had no rights or claims to anything. They received everything they had as a gift.
To receive the kingdom of God like a child, therefore, is to receive all the blessings Jesus offers us as a gift
– and not as something we earn or deserve. It is to approach God the same way a little child approaches
its parents: in simple, humble trust. It means that we leave our doubts and skepticism behind - simply
listening to Jesus in faith. It means that we will look forward to every opportunity we have to spend time
with Jesus, where He embraces and blesses us by the power of his Word.
“I tell you the truth,” Jesus says, “anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will
never enter it.” His point is clear: there is no salvation for those who refuse to humble themselves like little
children before Him. Relying on our mature wisdom, understanding and work will get us nowhere except
hell. Simple, childlike faith is all that matters. It is the only thing that unites us with Christ in order that
we might receive the forgiveness, life and salvation won for us through His cross.
This is why, as we bring our children to Jesus, let us not neglect bringing ourselves, for we too are children
of God through faith. Don’t let the devil, world and your sinful nature steal you away from the blessings
Christ wants to give you. Watch, pray and come to meet Christ in His Word and Sacraments on a regular
basis. Then Jesus will lift you too in his arm, hug you, speak tenderly to you and bless you just as He did
the children in our text.
Parents, I thank God that you brought your children here today to be blessed by Jesus. Continue to bring
them every Sunday, letting nothing hinder them from being blessed by their Savior. Moreover, continue
bringing yourself to Jesus, so that you might receive the same blessings your children are receiving – ever
growing in faith and love toward God. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",9/13/2015,
"Let me tell you a true story: A certain, foolish soldier was sent to a dangerous country much like
Afghanistan. Because he was told that the very people he was supposed to liberate hated him, he
was always on guard – expecting an attack at any moment.
But the attacks never came. Sure, maybe he heard a gun shot every once in a while, but nothing
major. Over time, then, this soldier became complacent. He stopped wearing his armor. Why?
Because all that equipment was heavy, uncomfortable and seemingly unnecessary. There was no
real danger, was there? None that he could see.
Now, what do you think about that soldier’s attitude? Certainly it was by God’s grace that he
hadn’t been killed! What was he thinking?! Everyone knows that the deadliest enemies don’t
attack right away, but hide: waiting and watching for us to let our guard down. Neither you nor I
would be so stupid as to leave off our life-saving equipment in such a dangerous place, would we?
Since this is a true story, let me tell you who the foolish soldier is? It’s you and me! Let me
explain what I mean.
God has called all Christians to active duty with the mission of liberating souls from Satan. Even
though the major conflict of this war has already been won by Christ, the very people we are trying
to liberate are blinded by the devil’s propaganda. Like our soldiers in Afghanistan, we constantly 
2
face danger on this earth. No, attacks don’t occur all the time, but they certainly do come – most
often when we least expect it and are ill-prepared.
All of us probably personally know a solid Christian, who got picked off by Satan and fell away
from their faith.
Think about them for a moment.
What was their problem? They were not prepared. What about you? Are you prepared for
battle? St. Paul says you are if: 1) You understand your enemy, and respect the danger he poses,
2) Arm yourself for the conflict with the superior armor and weapons God has given you, and 3)
Stay in communication with Jesus, the Commander of the Lord’s Army.
Part One: Understand your enemy.
God has liberated us from our sins through the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and He wants us to use that
same Gospel to liberate others. This is the mission to which we, Christians, have been called.
Now, in any war, one of the most important things a soldier needs to know is who his enemies are
and of what they're capable. The worst enemy a soldier can have is a hidden one. This is the kind
of enemy we have. Paul reminds us of this fact, when he writes:
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you
can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,
but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against
the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
What does Paul mean when He says that our fight is against “the rulers, authorities, and powers
of this dark world, and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms”? It means that
our fight is against the devil and all the demons of hell who are allied with this wicked world and
our own sinful flesh! Our war is spiritual. We are not fighting stupid, powerless enemies, but
crafty ones who are well equipped, numerous and trained.
One of the greatest tricks Al-Qaeda used before 9/11 was being so hidden that many questioned
the terrorist group’s existence. This secrecy allowed them to launch a horrible attack against our
nation 14 years ago. In a similar way, the devil also convinces people that he doesn’t exist so as
to attack when we least expect it.
Oh, how I wish that the devil was a visible dragon for all to see! Why? Because a giant, horrific
monster would be a lot easier to fight and avoid, than the devil’s true form of being a spirit and
hidden. If we would spend time considering the true power and craftiness of our enemy, we would
soon realize that we, by ourselves, are outmatched and in serious danger. 
3
And that’s exactly the point God wants us to know. He doesn’t want us to live our lives spiritually
naked – vulnerable to every attack. He wants us to face our daily battles in His strength and
clothed in the armor He so graciously provides.
Part 2: Arm yourself for the conflict.
Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to
stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.
From goggles to galoshes, each piece of a soldier’s gear is vitally important – ready to both help
him accomplish his mission and save his life. For this reason, a soldier needs to know what his
equipment is for and how to use it. And if this is true for earthly warfare, how much more true is
it in regard to our spiritual fight.
Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of
righteousness in place, and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of
peace.
The first piece of equipment Paul mentions is the belt of truth. An armored belt was important to
the Roman soldier for two reasons: 1) It protected his abdomen from an upward sword thrust. 2)
It tied his armor together – keeping it in place.
Many Christians think that truth is whatever they “feel” is true; but this is not the case. If they
thus play fast and loose with the truth, they won’t have the rest of their armor properly fitted. The
devil will see this and attack where they’re unprotected.
Retaining the truth is, therefore, vitally important. And what is truth? It is the Gospel (God’s
Word) with nothing added to or subtracted from it, and none of its meaning changed. Keeping the
truth makes sure that Jesus’ righteousness is always covering us, and not flopping around, leaving
us exposed to a deadly attack.
How do we buckle the truth around us? By studying God’s Word and making sure that it alone
decides our doctrine and faith. This will keep the rest of our spiritual armor in order.
Paul mentions the breastplate of righteousness next. A breastplate is very important - protecting
the heart from a direct hit.
What is the breastplate of righteousness? It is Jesus’ perfect record of keeping the law. It is the
righteousness that He won for us on the cross. Having Jesus’ record covering our heart through
faith means that, whenever Satan slices at us with his sword of guilt, Christ’s righteousness covers
us and assures us that we stand forgiven and loved by God.
The next piece of equipment is having our feet fitted with the proper footwear that keeps us running
to accomplish our mission. And what is that? It’s our desire to share the gospel of peace at all
times in all places with all people. Christ’s love compels us to love others - running to tell them 
4
the good news of great joy. This joy in the Gospel helps us stand firm in the heat of battle. It leads
us to confess with the apostles: “I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God
for the salvation of everyone who believes.” (Romans 1:16, NIV84)
In addition to all this, Paul says, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the
flaming arrows of the evil one. The shield the apostle references here is a large, rectangular shield
Roman soldiers used to protect themselves as they advanced in ranks against an enemy. Whenever
an arrow attack came, they could hide under these shields, and the arrow attack was rendered
useless.
Our faith shields us from both the temptations and accusations Satan hurls at us. How does it do
that? Well, faith is a God-given confidence in everything He promises us, especially the promise
about our sins being forgiven in Christ! When we look to God in trust, we duck under our shield,
and the flaming arrows of the devil are rendered absolutely useless.
Paul says: Take the helmet of salvation. One solid blow to the head can kill a person instantly.
This is why our brains ought to always be occupied with the salvation Jesus won for us on the
cross. Do what he will, the devil can not kill those who find their refuge in Christ’s saving work.
Finally, Paul tells us to take up the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. Our weapon is
not human reason to convince people that there is a “god”. Our weapon is not government law
forcing people to be Christian. No, our weapon (like our armor) is spiritual because our enemy is
spiritual. Our weapon is God’s Word. We wield it by studying, remembering and proclaiming it.
This sword of the Spirit is powerful enough to slice through even the toughest spiritual armor - as
the author of the letter to the Hebrews writes: For the word of God is living and active. Sharper
than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it
judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. (Hebrews 4:12, NIV84)
This is the full armor God gives us for our battles. Oh, how foolish we are in that we often don’t
use all the items God puts at our disposal. Sometimes we neglect setting aside time to read God’s
Word or coming to Church. In doing so, we forfeit our weapon. Other times, we are tempted not
to hold on to the truth, and thus loosen our armor. How many times are we less than eager to
spread the Gospel? Yes, we are foolish soldiers – often neglecting to use the divine equipment
God has given us. For this we ought to repent – realizing the danger into which we put ourselves.
Thanks be to Christ that He forgives our sin – even our sin of complacency. In the peace of this
forgiveness let us don the great armor God has given us, using it in our fight - no longer leaving
our souls open to attack.
Part Three: Stay in communication with your commander.
Now that we know our enemy and are armed for the fight, there is one more piece of
encouragement Paul gives us to be truly ready for battle. Guess what a soldier’s most important
piece of equipment is? The radio. Why? Because, it allows a soldier to call for help, support,
medical equipment, air strikes . . . you name it! A soldier can also relay information for another 
5
group so that they can be helped. You can almost say that the radio puts a nation’s entire arsenal
at a soldier’s disposal.
Paul tells us: pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this
in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.
Prayer is our means of communicating to God, and puts His entire army at our disposal. This is
why Paul encourages us to pray at all times and in every situation – informing God of everything
that is going on in both your life and in the lives of others. God wants us to call upon him in every
trouble, and not face our battles alone. He wants us to be well equipped and supported, and this is
why we pray.
Therefore, pray for both yourself and every other Christian soldier in this Church. Pray when
fellow Christians are in a fierce firefight with the devil. Pray when the fight is going either poorly
or well. Pray in times of both war and peace - always rejoicing in Jesus, your commander and
chief who protects you.
And I, as your pastor, ask that you pray for me too – just as St. Paul asked the Ephesians: “Pray
also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make
known the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare
it fearlessly, as I should.”
Yes, pray for me that I too might be fearless, that words may be given me whenever I open my
mouth to speak, because the devil likes tempting me with fear: the fear of saying the wrong thing
or of offending a person by what I say. I need the Lord’s strength and your prayers help greatly.
Dear Christian, you and I are at war. We are in hostile territory, far from our home of heaven. Let
us not continue being foolish soldiers. Let us be wise in Christ. Are you ready for battle? You are
if you know your enemy, arm yourself for the battle, and stay in communication with your
commander. Having prepared in such a fashion, you can go out through those doors - ready to
fight. Remember the victory is already won. We are just rescuing those still caught under Satan’s
tyranny, waiting for the final trumpet call home. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",9/6/2015,
"Dear Fellow Christians!
Jesus' conversation with the Jews in our text took place following his miraculous feeding of 
a crowd of some 5,000 hungry men plus the women and children who were present. He fed 
them with 5 small barley loaves and two small fish that a boy had brought with him. This 
miracle, like all the others Jesus did, was a sign. It pointed to Jesus as the Son of God and the 
provider  of  all  our  earthly  needs.  It  revealed  his  love  and  compassion.  And  because  the 
people  had  followed  Jesus  to  a  remote  place  to  hear  his  Word,  this  miracle  also 
demonstrated  the  truth  of  his  promise, ""Seek  first  God's  kingdom  and  his  righteousness, 
and all these things will be given you as well."" (Mt 6:33). 
But the people turned it around. To them, the miracle was a sign that Jesus should be their 
bread-king. This was the kind of Messiah they could use: one who would fill their stomachs 
with  food  that  multiplied  in  his  hands,  so  they  wouldn't  have  to  work  anymore.  They 
missed  the  point  completely.  The  lesson  was  to  be  the  same  that  God  taught  their 
forefathers  in  the  desert  when  he  caused  them  to  be  hungry  and  then  miraculously  fed 
them with manna, namely that ""man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that 
comes from the mouth of the LORD"" (Deut. 8:3) 
When they found Jesus the next day, Jesus told them, ""Don't work for food that spoils, but 
for  food  that  endures  to  eternal life,  which  the  Son  of Man  will  give  you""  (Jn  6:27).  This 
""work,"" he explained, was to believe in him, whom God the Father had sent into the world 
(v. 29). But their minds were stuck on earthly food, so Jesus told them in plain words, ""The 
Bread  of God is he who comes down  from heaven and gives life  to  the world.  ...  I am  the 
Bread of Life. He who comes  to me will never go hungry, and he who believes in me will 
never be thirsty. ... My Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in 
him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the Last Day"" (Jn 6:33, 35, 40).
Jesus is the Bread of Life. This great truth is still rejected by many who hear it. But it is the 
truth  taught by God, and  those who do believe it — those who eat  this bread — will live 
forever.
The  Jews refused  to believe  that  Jesus is  the Bread of Life. When  they heard what he was 
saying, they ""began to grumble about him because he said, ""I am the bread that came down 
from heaven."" 42 They said, ""Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we 
know?  How  can  he  now  say,  'I  came  down  from  heaven'?""    They  grumbled,  because  this 
ordinary man,  from  an insignificant little  town in  Galilee,  was  claiming  that  God  was  his 
father, and that he was sent by God from heaven down to earth to be the Bread of Life, to 
give  life  to  the  world!  They  didn’t  accept  what  Jesus  was  saying  about  himself.  After  all, 
they knew his  father,  Joseph  the carpenter, and his mother Mary. So how could he say, ""I 
came down from heaven,"" since his parents were known? Undeniably, he was good at doing 
miracles — and they especially liked the most recent one! — but to call God his father and 
to  say  that he had  come  from heaven and was  the Bread  of  Life, – well,  that was making 
himself equal with God. It was blasphemous. 
Obviously,  they  didn’t  know  about  the  circumstances  of  Jesus'  conception  and  birth.  But 
even if they had, would it have made a difference? Would anyone have believed Jesus if he 
had told them he was conceived by the Holy Spirit, that his mother was a virgin when she 
gave birth to him, and that Joseph was Jesus' foster father, not his biological father?  
Jesus’ birth of a virgin continues to be a stumbling block to human reason. It's unscientific. 
A virgin can't become pregnant without  the involvement of a man.  It just doesn't happen. 
And  saying  that  God's  Son  was  conceived  by  the  power  of  the Holy  Spirit in  the  virgin's 
womb only compounds the difficulty. How could the infinite God possibly live in a human 
body?
But  there  is  a  deeper  reason  why  people  reject  Jesus  as  the  Bread  of  Life.  It's  the  same 
reason the  Jews rejected him: their minds were on earthly things. The  Jews thought  Jesus 
would make a wonderful bread-king for them — not the Bread of Life who would give his 
flesh for the life of the world by dying on the cross for the sin of the world, but a king who 
would give them everything they wanted in this life, provide instant relief from all suffering 
and illness, and would restore Israel to the glory it once had among the nations. They didn't 
need a Savior coming from heaven; an earthly Messiah would do just fine.
Today, too, people are willing to see in Jesus a man who was a great teacher and example 
who preached love and peace and unity, and who taught sharing and social justice; but not 
the Bread of Life who came down from heaven to give real life to the world by his death and 
resurrection. Their minds are on earthly things. Bottom line: they don't want to admit that 
they are lost sinners, doomed to hell and desperately in need of salvation. Both their sinful 
reason and their enmity against God make it impossible for them to see in Jesus the Bread 
of Life – their Bread of Life.
Jesus  saw  knew  why  the  Jews  were  grumbling  about  him.  ""Stop  grumbling  among 
yourselves,"" he  said. With  their grumbling  they were just entrenching  themselves in  their 
unbelief.  With  great  patience  he  revealed  to  them  the  remedy  for  their  unbelief.  ""Stop 
grumbling– and listen to me!"" Jesus was saying, in effect.  
What was he saying? 44 ""No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, 
and I will raise him up at the last day."" Jesus knew that nobody, by his own decision or will, 
can come  to him,  see him as  the Bread  of  Life and believe in him. He  knows what is in a 
man. We are defiant enemies of God by nature – dead in our transgressions and sins, and 
under the control of Satan. 
But God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world 
through  him  (Jn  3:17),  and  so  the  Father  draws  sinners  who  by  nature  are  enemies,  to 
come  to Christ,  to see him as  the Bread of Life,  their Savior, and  to believe in him. On  the 
Last Day, when Jesus returns in glory and the dead are raised, those the Father has drawn 
to him will be raised to eternal life.
How  does  the  Father  ""draw""  sinners  to  his  Son?  Jesus  tells  us:  45 ""It  is  written  in  the 
Prophets: 'They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from 
him  comes  to  me.""  God  does  not  force  anyone  to  come  to  his  Son–to  believe  in  him.  He 
""draws"" sinners to Jesus — by teaching them. ""All your sons will be taught by the Lord, and 
great will be your children's peace"" (Is 54:13), Isaiah wrote. 
But how does God do that? How does he teach sinners and draw them to Jesus? He inspired 
men – prophets in the Old Testament, and apostles and evangelists in the New Testament –
to  speak  his  Word.  He  gives  his  Church  evangelists,  pastors  and  teachers,  to  teach  that 
inspired Word  of  the  Prophets  and  Apostles. He  has  given  us his Word,  the  Bible,  which 
testifies  of  Jesus—tells  us who  he is  ,  how  he loves  us, what  he  has  done  for  us,  how  he 
saved us.  In all  this it is God who is  teaching us. He  teaches us  through his Son and Holy 
Spirit—through his Word, the Bible.
At  that  very moment, God was teaching  them  through  the words  of  Jesus.  46 ""No  one  has 
seen  the  Father  except  the  one  who  is from  God, Jesus  told  the  Jews;  only  he  has  seen  the 
Father."" He was teaching them about his relationship with God the Father – that he was the 
Son of the Father, that he had come from God to be the Bread of Life — to save them!
Only Jesus, the holy Son of God who was God and was with God from eternity has seen the 
Father.  He  speaks  the  words  the  Father  gives  him.  ""Don't  you  believe  that  I  am  in  the 
Father, and that the Father is in me?"" he asked his disciples. ""The words I say to you are not 
just my own. Rather, it is  the Father, living in me, who is doing his work""  (Jn 14:10). Oh, 
listen to Jesus, dear friends! God is teaching us through him, just as he taught the Jews. His 
teaching draws us to him. But if we don't listen to his teaching, how can the Father draw us 
to him? Listen to the Father speaking through the Son and Spirit in the Word! Listen, and 
learn from God himself. Then you will keep coming to Jesus, the Bread of Life, drawn by the 
Father's teaching.
God's teaching works faith in the hearts of sinners — faith that receives Jesus as the Bread 
of Life. 
47 I  tell  you  the  truth,  he  who  believes  has  everlasting  life, Jesus  says, in  plain  speech  and 
without metaphor.  This is  what  the  Father is  teaching  through  his  Son.  Eat  the  Bread  of 
Life! Believe in  Jesus,  the Source and Giver of  true life  that lasts  through all eternity. The 
benefits of this spiritual eating are infinitely greater than those of physical eating. 49 ""Your 
forefathers ate the manna in the desert, yet they died,"" He tells the  Jews. Manna was also a 
bread from heaven. For forty years, God daily, miraculously, provided manna to nourish the 
Israelites in the desert and to keep them alive. But although it miraculously appeared every 
morning, it was an earthly  food, like  the loaves and  fish.  It didn't keep  the  Israelites alive 
forever. All who ate the manna eventually died.  
50 ""But here is the bread that comes down from heaven, which a man may eat and not die,"" 
Jesus says, and I can imagine him pointing to himself as his says this. He goes on: 51 ""I am 
the  living  bread  that  came  down  from  heaven. If  anyone  eats  of  this  bread,  he  will  live 
forever."" Yes,  God  so  loved  the  world  that  he  gave  his  one  and  only  Son,  that  whoever 
believes in him will not perish but have eternal life (Jn 3:16). This living bread from heaven 
is for everyone, offered freely — no strings attached! In Isaiah 55, the Lord calls to all who 
hunger and thirst for salvation, ""Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you 
who  have  no  money,  come,  buy  and  eat!  Come,  buy  wine  and  milk  without  money  and 
without  cost. Why  spend money  on  what is  not  bread, and  your labor  on  what  does  not 
satisfy? Listen, listen to me, and eat what is good, and your soul will delight in the richest of 
fare. Give ear and come to me; hear me, that your soul may live!"" (Is 55:1-3). 
To eat  Jesus,  the Bread of Life, is  to believe in Him, in who he is and what he has done to 
win forgiveness of sins and eternal life for unworthy sinners like us. How did Jesus become 
the Source of eternal life for us?  ""This bread is my flesh,"" he says, ""which I will give for the 
life of the world."" The Son of God become  flesh, was made man,  to win our salvation. As a 
true  man,  he  became  our  Brother  and  Substitute,  taking  our  place  under  God's  law  and 
fulfilling it in perfect love for us, who did not and could not keep it. And then, as a true man, 
he offered  himself  up  on  the  cross  for  the  life  of  the  world,  the  guiltless  for  the  guilty, 
suffering  and  dying  in  our  stead  under  the  wrath  of  God  that  our  sins  deserved.  ""The 
Word,"" the Son of God ""was made flesh"" (Jn 1:14) to give his flesh for the redemption of the 
world. His resurrection on  the  third day is proof  that his Father accepted his sacrifice on 
our behalf. 
All who eat  this Bread  of  Life —all who  believe in  Jesus—have eternal life. Death  cannot 
harm them; they will live forever! Today he offers us his body and blood to eat and to drink 
in his Holy Supper. Here, too, reason objects and says, ""It cannot be!"" But God teaches that 
it is so: that in with and under the bread and wine we eat his body given for us and drink 
his blood of the covenant shed for the forgiveness of sins. Through this teaching the Father 
draws us to his Son, and we believe and receive his promise of everlasting life in Jesus, our 
Living Bread from heaven. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",8/30/2015,
"Most of us understand the importance of healthy food: if you live on nothing but Big Macs and soda, you
will probably have an early appointment with the grave. However, did you know that your soul needs
proper nutrition every bit as much as your body? Even though we may have known this fact it is sad how
often we live as if we don’t!
There are only two types of spiritual food in this world. One type will keep your soul healthy and alive.
The other type will make you sick and die – not just physically, but eternally in hell. Our sermon text
compares and contrasts these two types of “soul food” - as well as their sources. Let us learn from the
insight God gave King Solomon to answer the question: Where will your soul eat? Compare the chefs,
compare the food and compare the consequences.
If you have ever travelled to a foreign country, you know how hard it is to pick a place to eat. Why?
Because you are “inexperienced”. You don’t know which restaurants are good and which you should avoid.
If you don’t understand the language – you won’t know what’s on the menu.
When it comes to spiritual things we are all, by nature, inexperienced. When Adam and Eve fell into sin,
they lost the divine wisdom with which God created them. They became spiritually senseless, naïve and
selfish.
All of Adam’s children are born in his likeness. By nature, none of us understand what is good. We are
easily deceived. And just as crooks are always looking to take advantage of the weak – especially foreigners
who don’t know any better - so also the devil, world and our own sinful nature want to prey on us.
Thankfully God does not want us lost to the devil. He cares for us deeply. This is why he planned a way
to save us and invites us to come to Him.
Yes, both good and evil (Wisdom and Folly) are vying for our attention, calling out: “Whoever is 
inexperienced, enter here!
Did you notice that verses 4 & 16 are virtually identical? The fact that both Folly and Wisdom sound the
same illustrates that we, by nature, do not know to whom we are to listen. We are like visitors to a foreign
nation: one restaurant tells us we should eat here, but another one tells us we should eat there. Where should
we go? Does it really matter?
People often say: “All religions lead to the same place. It doesn’t matter how you worship God just as long
as you worship him. Pick a church and stick with it.” Why do people say such things? Because they are
inexperienced in spiritual matters. They assume that, just because all churches and religions claim to offer
similar things that they are basically the same.
But this is not the case! Just as a con man will never tell you that he is offering you nothing but lies and
hurt, so also the devil will always try to appear as an angel of light – someone we can trust. Therefore, it
is important for us to look beyond the spiritual food being offered to our souls to who is doing the offering.
On the one side you have woman Folly. She represents the wisdom of the world, which is selfish and
corrupted by the devil. Solomon describes her and her food in this way:
13 The woman Folly is rowdy; she is gullible and knows nothing. 14 She sits by the doorway of her house,
on a seat at the highest point of the city, 15 calling to those who pass by, who go straight ahead on their
paths: 16 “Whoever is inexperienced, enter here!” To the one who lacks sense, she says, 17 “Stolen water is
sweet, and bread eaten secretly is tasty!”
When the world offers ways to spiritual purpose, peace, hope and self-fulfillment, it really does not know
what it is talking about. Sure, the world sounds good. Who isn’t attracted to sentiments like: “Follow your
heart. Do what seems best for you. Just let others be and do your best to be yourself. Don’t let others
judge you because you have the potential to be special and great if you just follow your own path.” But
what do these sentiments actually mean? They are nothing, help nothing and are utterly meaningless
because they are based in selfish, feeling driven gobbledygook!
The spiritual food the world offers is basically one of two things: 1) hedonism (seek all the pleasure you
can get out of life while you can) or 2) work righteousness (which basically is saying it’s up to you to find
and cook your own spiritual food). This is the basic bread and water the world offers to all. It might seem
good, but it only leads to trouble.
But then there is Wisdom. Who is she? Compare this section of Scripture to the parables Jesus spoke
concerning the Great Banqueti
and the Wedding Feastii and it soon becomes clear that the Wisdom spoken
of here is the Wisdom of God. It is Jesus himself, of whom Paul says in his letter to the Colossians: All the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Him.
iii
Divine Wisdom is not a lazy lady like worldly Folly. Let us look at the fine details with which Solomon
describes her:
Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. Most ancient houses were lucky to have
one or two pillars. But the house Jesus built has seven. In other words, God’s house, the Church, is not
some cheap building. No, it is beautiful and enduring. It is the grand sum of believers on earth and in
heaven who, in the words of St. Peter, as living stones, are being built into a spiritual house for a holy
priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. iv Jesus built the Church as
the place where we may receive the meal that He, in His wisdom, has prepared for our salvation. 
Solomon continues the analogy: She [Wisdom] has prepared her meat; she has mixed her wine; she has
also set her table.
The Hebrew of this verse literally reads: She has slaughtered her meat. This “slaughtering” reminds us of
all the lambs that were offered on Israel’s altars – offerings that all pointed to the one great sacrifice Jesus
would make on our behalf. Concerning this sacrifice, Isaiah wrote: he (Jesus) was led like a lamb to the
slaughter.
v Surely he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment
that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed. 6 We all, like sheep, have gone
astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.vi
Jesus is the chef of our salvation - having willingly sacrificed himself on the cross for our sins. This is how
he prepared for us His special meal of forgiveness, peace and hope. And how do we receive this food?
Through repentance and faith. And what is repentance? It is two things: first of all being sorry for our
sins – recognizing that we deserve God’s righteous wrath because of them - and secondly believing in Jesus
and His work for our forgiveness.
Jesus, therefore, is not only the chef, he is also the spiritual food we eat. His work and his word bring life
to our souls and lead us on the right path.
King Solomon says that Wisdom has sent out her female servants; she calls out from the highest points of
the city: 4 “Whoever is inexperienced, enter here!” To the one who lacks sense, she says, 5 “Come, eat my
bread, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Leave inexperience behind, and you will live; pursue the way of
understanding.
Notice that Jesus cares for us so much that He doesn’t just invite those who happen to stop by His house.
No, he goes out and searches for guests – inviting everyone who is both near and far to his feast.
Now it is certainly true that Jesus himself isn’t physically seen inviting people to faith (because he’s in
heaven preparing a place for us) but make no mistake: his voice is heard. Pastors, teachers, evangelists and
all concerned Christians are the servants Jesus has sent into the world to seek and invite all people to His
feast. The body He offered and blood He shed on the cross for our forgiveness is the spiritual bread and
wine he invites us to receive. It is the precious food of forgiveness, life and salvation.
And so Jesus bids us leave all our inexperience behind – all the foolishness of our nature that only gets us
in trouble. He wants us to know what is true, noble and good - offering us true righteousness and holiness
as a gift. And, having received this gift through faith, we have life. God unites us to himself. He restores
His image in us - the image which Adam and Eve had lost in the fall- and awakens in our hearts a desire to
serve him instead of ourselves. His feast moves us to leave our sinful way of life behind so that we might
remain in his house – feasting on His Word and Sacraments!
And what is the result of eating such food? It results in both awakening and sustaining us in our faith. It
offers us true and eternal life with God in the perfect paradise he is even now preparing for us in heaven.
Oh how much better is this than the spiritual junk food worldly Folly offers us! Sure, the wisdom of the
world may sound good, but it is worthless. The person who goes to her house for food doesn’t realize that
it is poison, that the departed spirits are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol (or to say it another
way: Folly’s guests are in hell’s grip!)
There you have it. If you feed on the world’s wisdom, you will soon find yourself away from God and in
the company of the devil. 
And so, dear Christian, listen to divine wisdom. Heed Christ’s call to come and eat His food. Read your
Bible. Have family devotions. Come to Church. Join a Bible class. Since the Word and Sacraments are
the only place where you receive the feast God graciously offers for your salvation, center your whole life
around the use of these means. Schedule your weeks and days around opportunities to meet with Christ
through worship, Bible study and prayer.
If you don’t you will soon find yourself swallowing the garbage the world offers you. You hear her voice
everywhere – on TV, the radio, the internet and in print. Worldly Folly is a big proponent of social media
and public education. She is heard in the voice of your friends who support your decisions to follow your
own desires instead of God’s Word. She is everywhere – proud and provocative, enticing you to your
eternal death.
Divine Wisdom, however, is only found in the Gospel – always pointing you to life.
And so, dear Christian, where will you eat? Will you follow Folly or will you cling to Christ? My prayer
is that, with the Spirit’s aid, you cling to Christ – ever eating the wonderful feast for forgiveness He has
prepared for you; centering your life around His means of grace. Then you will know divine Wisdom.
Then you will have the eternal life God has graciously purposed for you since the beginning of time. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",8/23/2015,
"Imagine Packer general manager Ted Thompson appearing at your door one day telling you that they want
you on their team.
“Who me?” I would probably ask. “Alright where are the cameras! This is some sort of joke, isn’t it?”
Imagine that it wasn’t a joke – that the Packers really want you. Now, that would certainly be a great honor
– but a scary one too! I could just imagine telling Mr. Thompson: “Why me? I am a horrible player and
would probably make you guys lose!”
He replies: “No, nothing is going to make us lose. Make no mistake: Aaron, Jordy, Eddie and the rest of
the crew will win the Super bowl for us this year – I guarantee it! We don’t necessarily “need” you, but
want you and have even prepared a special place on our team - just for you. If you are willing to give us
your all – striving to do better than your best both on and off the field – then we would be happy to welcome
you to our organization and guarantee that one of your fingers will be wearing a Super bowl ring by this
time next summer.”
Wow, what would you say to this? I don’t know about you, but I would want to play. I would also want
to do my best for the team – thanking them for letting me be a part of their Super bowl run.
Now, the likelihood of Ted Thompson asking any one of us to be a part of the Packers this year is extremely
low. But, VBS children, someone has visited you this past week and asked you to be a part of His team.
Who is that? God himself.
No, God didn’t ring your doorbell at home to talk with you. But make no mistake, you did meet with Him.
Through all the lessons you learned in VBS, God has been inviting you to join the likes of Caleb, Joseph,
Andrew, Timothy and Naaman’s servant girl. He knows you, loves you and has even created a special
place for you on Team Jesus – and this is a far greater honor than playing for the Packers.
“Why is that?” you might ask. Because God is God; He is the most powerful person there is. He is the
almighty King of Kings who created the whole universe and controls it. All the mountains and seas, the
moon and stars, every wonderful sunset and sunrise – God created it all for us in love. And He has promised
us much more: eternal life to all who look to His Son Jesus in faith.
Sadly, however, the very first people that ever lived (Adam and Eve) sinned against God by doing the very
thing He commanded them not to do! This act of disobedience had a devastating effect on the whole human
race: it separated us from both God and heaven. Because of this disobedience all people are born sinful
and there is all sorts of evil in the world. Because of this sin there is death and the threat of hell.
But God does not want anyone separated from him in hell. Knowing that there is no way we could save
ourselves, God the Father asked his Son to be our Champion. He asked Jesus to be born like us so that he
could live the perfect, sinless life we all failed to live and, having accomplished that, take all our sins upon
himself in order to suffer the eternal consequences we deserve because of them.
And do you know what? Jesus did everything his Father asked. He paid for the sins of all by living, dying
and rising from the dead. He did this so that who ever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.
Jesus, our great champion, has already won the crown of eternal life – something far more valuable than
any Super bowl ring. Jesus won heaven and wants you to have it as well! He wants you to share in his
victory over sin, death and the power of the devil. No, God doesn’t need you; He doesn’t need any of us!
But He most definitely loves you, wants you and has even prepared a special place for you on His team.
If you believe in Jesus, then you are already one of God’s chosen champions in Christ – a member of Team
Jesus who is assured victory over sin, death and the devil. Let us now learn how we can thank God for this
great honor by doing the things He wants us to do as members of His team. Let us learn that: God’s chosen
champions . . . 1) Are focused 2) Train Hard 3) Compete with Determination.
Part One: Are Focused
The apostle Paul was one of God’s chosen champions in Christ. In a letter that he wrote to a church in
Corinth, the apostle Paul reminded the Christians there that being a member of God’s Team is an honor that
none of us deserve! Earlier in this letter he wrote: Brothers, think of what you were when you were called.
Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were influential; not many were of noble birth.
But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to
shame the strong.i
Just as there is no way that I am even close to being good enough to play for the Packers, even more so
there is no way any of us deserve to be on God’s team. Understand, then, that being called to faith in Jesus
is a great honor and a privilege – one that should motivate us to work hard at glorifying his name.
This is why the apostle Paul writes: Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets
the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.
“But wait a second,” you might be thinking, “Didn’t you say that we belong to team Jesus? When a team
wins doesn’t everybody win?” Why yes, this is true! “Then why does Paul say that only one gets the prize,
and that an individual should run in such a way as to get it? Is he saying that we have to beat other people
to get to heaven?” No, this is not what Paul is saying. What he means is this: that we should be so focused
on the prize of heaven that Jesus won for us, that we do everything in our power to get it – and not just let
our team drag us along for the ride! Let me explain what I mean with an illustration:
The Packers are a team and yet, in training camp, each player works hard in his position as an individual –
as if everything depended on him; and in a certain way it does, because if a player doesn’t give it his all in
camp, he might get cut from the team. Playing for the Packers is an honor, but being on Team Jesus is an
even greater honor. And so, just as every Packer fan wants every player to play his position better than 
anyone else – focusing on winning - so God wants us to focus on receiving the prize of heaven that Jesus
won for us. He also wants us to work hard at winning other souls for his kingdom by sharing his Gospel
with our family friends and neighbors. Yes, we belong to a team, but as members of this team God wants
each of us to individually live to his glory – ever focused on the prize waiting for us at the end of our lives
and striving forward to get it.
Part Two: Train Hard.
The apostle Paul continues: Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get
a crown that will not last; but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.
Professional athletes train hard both on and off the field. They know that every decision they make, from
how much sleep they get, to the food they eat, to the weights they lift, to how far they run, bike or swim,
will affect their performance.
What is true for the elite athlete is also true for the Christian. Being a member of Team Jesus means more
than just coming to church on most Sundays. It means that our whole lives are dedicated to him. Every
choice we make in life - from the TV shows we watch and music we listen to, to the career choices and
friends we make – all has an impact on our faith. And it’s important for us to realize this. Why? So that
these choices don’t tempt us away from the privilege of being on God’s team.
Think of it this way: If a Packer player decided that he could do whatever he wanted after training, and he
stayed up late partying every night, wouldn’t you agree that this would affect his performance? Of course
it would! And if his team warned him about it, but he didn’t change . . . does he really value being a part
of the team? No he doesn’t.
God has graciously called you to be a member of Team Jesus – one of his champions! Understand the
honor this is and train like a champion. And how do you do that? First and foremost by studying God’s
Word both at Church and at home. The Gospel is powerful. It is the only means the Holy Spirit uses to
create and strengthen saving faith in our hearts. The Gospel tells us everything Jesus did to win our
salvation. It tells us that, through faith in Jesus, we have become children of God, princes and princesses of
heaven who have been adopted into his family. The Bible encourages us to stick to Jesus by avoiding sin
and, if we do sin, looking to Him in repentance and faith for forgiveness. God’s wonderful promises
motivate us to train both on and off the field. His promises, with the Spirit’s help, move us to live every
aspect of our lives to God’s glory.
Part Three: Compete with Determination.
St. Paul writes: Therefore I do not run like a man running aimlessly; I do not fight like a man beating the
air. No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be
disqualified for the prize.
Elite teams like the Packers don’t compete aimlessly. Aaron Rogers doesn’t just throw the ball hoping that
someone will catch it. When Aaron Rogers throws the ball he knows exactly to whom he is throwing it.
The Packers always have a plan and they are confident that, if they follow their plan, they will win.
Everything is done for a reason. Every play is rehearsed over and over again so that, come game day, they
are a precision machine – every player's motion having a purpose to get the football to the goal line. 
In the same way God wants us to live our lives with determination. We read the same Bible stories over
and over again – starting when we are young and only ending when we die. Why? So that we don’t live
our lives aimlessly. All of us have a purpose. What is it? To live for Christ – using our various places and
callings in life to His glory. And the Bible tells us how we can do this. In a certain way the Bible is like
a play book – instructing each of us as to how we can do our part to witness the Gospel of God’s love
through our words and actions. The primary purpose of the Bible, however, is to tell us what Jesus has
done. It shows us where the victory is and encourages us to receive it.
This is why, even if you feel yourself getting tired of studying the Bible, keep on studying it - reviewing it
over and over again so that, come game day, you’ll be ready. Then you will be able to encourage the family
member who got sick. You’ll be able to comfort the friend whose parent died. You will be ready when
friends try to tempt you to do things that are wrong, and be ready to confess Christ’s forgiving love when,
filled with guilt, they see how their sinful choices led to very bad consequences. With the Spirit’s help,
you’ll be ready for everything – confident of the victory you have in Christ. And, in the end, you will hear
Jesus himself say: “Well done, my good servant! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter,
receive the crown of life that I promised you. 'Come, and take your inheritance, the kingdom that prepared
for you since the creation of the world.” Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",8/16/2015,
"Agree or Disagree: As long as you aren’t hurting anyone else, you should be able to do whatever feels good
to you.
This is the philosophy of our postmodern world; and I am convinced that this attitude – more than any other
cause – is the reason Christianity is in decline. People don’t “feel” like coming to church anymore. They
would rather do something more relaxing on a Sunday morning. People don’t feel like reading their Bibles
at home – wanting to pursue other hobbies or forms of entertainment instead.
But why not do whatever makes you feel good? Doesn’t God want our happiness? If we aren’t hurting
other people, what’s the harm? The harm is that such an attitude leads us away from God and His salvation
and back under the slavery of sin. Knowing this, God had the apostle Paul write down our sermon text,
through which He warns: Christian: don’t be like the people of the world! 1) Ignorant of Christ, they
are driven by sinful passions. 2) Instructed in Christ, we have been made holy and new.
Part One: Ignorant of Christ, they are driven by sinful passions.
In order to understand our sermon text correctly, we should briefly review what St. Paul wrote before it.
Up to this point, the apostle praises God for the mercy He showed by graciously saving us from our sins.
You see, even though we were once dead in our transgressions and sins (following the ways of this world;
gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts), God, who is rich in
mercy, made us alive with Christ.i
“
For,” Paul writes, “it is by grace you have been saved, through faith--and this not from yourselves, it is
the gift of God-- not by works, so that no one can boast. For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do. ii
And to keep us in this grace, God has united us together in the Church so that we might support each other
through the preaching of His Gospel, which defends us from every evil that tries to drive us away from
Him.
iii
In view of the awesome mercy, grace, forgiveness and protection that God gives us through the ministry of
His Gospel, the apostle Paul writes:
So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility
of their thinking.
Brothers and sisters in Christ, take careful note of what the apostle Paul is saying: living a god pleasing life
is not optional, it is mandatory! You simply cannot believe in Christ and continue living like the people of
this unbelieving world. Why not? Because, as the Apostle Paul says,
They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that
is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.
Even though the Gospel has been proclaimed for centuries, the unbelieving world neither understands nor
believes it. Why not? Simply put: because they don’t want to believe it. The people of this world enjoy
living under the mantra: do what feels right for you. They do not want to accept the truth that sex should
be reserved for one man and one woman in marriage. The people of this wicked world do not want to
believe their desires for pride, greed and materialism are wrong. They love pursuing these sins and do not
want to be condemned on account of them.
And so, even though their consciences may bear witness to the truth of God’s Word, they harden their hearts
against it - coming up with all sorts of excuses to justify their sins and convincing themselves that there is
no god to whom they are responsible; or, if there is a god, that he would want people to pursue whatever
their hearts desire.
Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of
impurity, with a continual lust for more.
Here you have our 21st century western world described in a nutshell! Abortion, homosexuality,
pornography, and uncontrolled materialism are all escalating. Every video game that comes out tries to be
more graphically violent than all those that came before. TV studios are constantly trying to produce shows
that increasingly appeal to the baseness of humanity. They same can be said about music, books . . . you
name it! And, as the Scriptures say, because of these, the wrath of God is coming.
iv
And we Christians are not unaffected by the worlds efforts to push boundaries. Why? Because our postmodern
world’s mantra to do whatever feels good is nothing more than the crass manifestation of the sinful
flesh that corrupts every human on this earth: including us!
Yes, even our own sinful flesh agrees with the world and cheers it on. It wants to be free to pursue whatever
it desires – and what it desires is always contrary to God’s will. It’s important for you to understand this:
that you have an enemy inside of you that is constantly trying to turn you away from your LORD. Your
sinful mind will always try to rationalize things that God’s Word clearly calls sin. Your sinful emotions
will try to get you to feel like God’s Word is too restrictive and that it’s ok to chase after the things we
shouldn’t. Your sinful will does not want to learn about Jesus, but is always tempting you to pursue all the
“exciting” things that the wicked world gets to do. Yes, temptations abound! How, then, can we avoid
pursuing the same selfish passions the world pursues when they are a part of our own sinful flesh?
Paul tells us how: by looking in faith to Christ, through whom we have been made holy and new!
Part Two: Instructed in Christ, we have been made holy and new.
The apostle Paul says: You, however, did not come to know Christ that way, that is, by rejecting the Gospel
and pursuing all sorts of selfish desires. Surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with
the truth that is in Jesus.
Christians are different than the world. In what way? We know Christ. And how did we come to know
him? By means of the Holy Spirit working through the Gospel to create faith in our hearts!
As I mentioned at the beginning of this sermon, the Apostle Paul, spent a considerable amount of ink
reminding His readers of the grace of God, which loved us from before the creation of the world. According
to this wonderful grace, God sent His son Jesus Christ to live the perfect life we all failed to live, and to die
in our place in order to pay for our sins in full. God raised Jesus from the dead to show that he accepted
his Son's payment for our sins. We stand forgiven before God – all because of Jesus.
But this forgiveness would do us no good if we didn’t hear and believe it. We would be like the rest of the
world for whom Jesus also died, but who reject this gift in order to pursue sin. So what did God do to
change this outcome? He sent out apostles armed with His Gospel. As they shared the good news, the
Holy Spirit worked faith in the hearts of many people. In turn, those new believers shared the Gospel with
others who also believed . . . and so on and so forth until the Gospel came down to us!
By God’s grace we have been taught the truth about both our need and our salvation. The Holy Spirit has
led us to recognize our sins and repent of them. He has also led us to see the love God has for us in Christ
– how he saved us to be his dearly loved children who, once again, have been restored in the image of God
that Adam and Eve lost when they first fell into sin.
You see, when the Holy Spirit created faith in our hearts by means of the Gospel, he also did something
else: he created in us a “new man,” whose will is not in tune with the world, but is in complete harmony
with God. It was created in our hearts at our baptism, when we were “born” of water and the spirit. This
new person inside of us is completely like Christ – desiring to do everything God the Father wishes – loving
him above all things. This new man is righteous and holy. It is who we truly are.
And God’s word encourages us to live according to this new man, as St. Paul says: You were taught, with
regard to your former way of life, to put off your old self, which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires;
to be made new in the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true
righteousness and holiness.
Now understand Paul’s words correctly. He is not saying that we can be sinless in this life. Such a thing
will never happen this side of heaven because, as long as we live, our sinful flesh will oppose God and try
to do whatever it wants. But this is not who we are. We, by God’s grace, are the new man the Holy Spirit
created in our hearts at our Baptisms.
This is why Paul encourages us to take off the old man and put on the new! How? Through daily prayer
and repentance. When we confess our sins to God (trusting that He will forgive us for Christ sake), we take
off the old Adam. As we remember our baptisms (when God declared us to be his dearly loved children) a
new desire awakens in us – one that wants to thank God for all He has done by living according to his will.
In this way we crucify our sinful nature together with all its passions.v Trusting in God’s promises, we seek
ways to avoid sin and please God. We go against the feelings of our sinful flesh – understanding that they
are trying to lead us away from Christ. We take time to study his Word and partake of His sacraments –
even when we don’t “feel” like it – because we understand that the LORD strengthens our faith through
these means. We trust that God will send his Spirit to help us live according to the new man he created in 
our hearts. He will keep his promise to deliver us safely through this life and bring us home to Himself in
heaven.
“But,” you might wonder, “what if I sin? I am weak and I often find myself doing things that I should not
be doing – giving into my sinful flesh instead of living according to God’s Word. What then?”
If this is what you fear, don’t despair. Rather, go to Jesus in prayer confessing your sin and trusting that
He will forgive you and help you in your fight against your flesh. In an encouraging letter to Christians in
Asia minor, the Apostle John once wrote: I write this to you so that you will not sin. But if anybody does
sin, we have one who speaks to the Father in our defense-- Jesus Christ, the Righteous One. He is the
atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole worldvi.
Jesus has forgiven all your sin. You belong to him. In response to this, dear Christian, don’t be like the
people of the world! Ignorant of Christ, they are driven by sinful passions. You, however, have been
made holy and new through faith in the Gospel. With Christ’s help, live according to the new man that the
Holy Spirit created in your heart – glorifying God’s saving grace through your words and actions. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",8/9/2015,
"Sometimes we don’t appreciate what we have until its gone; but by then it’s too late! This is why it’s good
to set aside specific events - like anniversaries – to recognize all the blessings God offers us in special
people, places and events so that we do not lose them through neglect.
This year marks our congregation’s 150th anniversary. Our church is truly a great treasure from the LORD
– one that we should esteem highly. Why? Because, as we will learn, the LORD has made Immanuel a
place where . . . 1) We find a home with the LORD. 2) We are strengthened for our journey through life.
3) We receive divine grace and glory.
Part One: We find a home with the LORD.
Our sermon text, the 84th Psalm was written by a son of Korah. We don’t exactly know what his particular
situation was, but it seems as if he, for some reason or another, was prevented from visiting God’s temple.
With a longing heart, he remembers all the blessings the LORD offers through his house.
He writes: How lovely are Your dwelling places, O LORD of hosts!
In Old Testament times, the LORD commanded his people to come to one specific place to meet with Him:
the temple in Jerusalem. There the priests, by their service, would foreshadow the mediation and sacrifice
Jesus would accomplish on our behalf. God designed his temple to be both a prefigurement of heaven and
a symbol of the Holy Christian church. There was only one old Testament dwelling place for God, and yet
look, the Psalmist writes: How lovely are Your dwelling places. (Did you notice the plural of “places”?)
Jesus once said: “Where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them."" i God’s dwelling
place, therefore, is no longer limited to one specific location. He promises to be wherever people gather
together in His name. One of those places is right here!
Yes, for 150 years Immanuel has been a lovely place where God dwells. How do we know he’s here?
Because God promises to be wherever his Word is preached and sacraments administered according to His
will.
The Psalmist continues: My soul longed and even yearned for the courts of the LORD; My heart and my
flesh sing for joy to the living God.
Do you have the longing for the LORD that the Psalmist expressed – where your whole being desires to be
with God? You should – considering all the amazing encouragements the LORD offers us through His
Word and Sacraments. Sadly we must confess that - even though our spirit is willing - our flesh is often
weak.ii
 Our sinful heart easily gets bored with God’s Word. It doesn’t want to invest time in learning about
God’s works and will. Because of the weakness of our sinful flesh, we easily neglect the wonderful
blessings God offers us through this congregation’s ministry – and if we continue down such a path
unchecked, we would soon lose both our faith and salvation.
Oh, how sad is our condition when this happens! If we would spend more time examining our hearts in the
light of God’s law and Gospel, we would realize how foolish we are. The Holy Spirit would open our eyes
to see the great love and forgiveness he offers us through his means of grace. We would rejoice in the
Church – finding in it a home for our soul.
Our Psalm continues: The bird also has found a house, And the swallow a nest for herself, where she may
lay her young, Even Your altars, O LORD of hosts, My King and my God.
Every sacrifice the Israelites performed on the temple’s altar pointed forward to the great once and for all
sacrifice Jesus would make on the cross for our salvation. Therefore, the birds making a home and laying
their young at the altars of the LORD is a poetical way of saying that the LORD does not chase anyone
away who approaches Him with a repentant heart. He happily allows everyone to build his life on the
sacrifice Jesus offered up for us on the cross. Blessed is the man or woman who does this. Blessed is every
parent who places their children in Christ’s arms - bringing them up in the instruction of the LORD. They
will live at peace with God and under his great protection. This is why the Psalmist says:
How blessed are those who dwell in Your house! They are ever praising You.
A home is something more than just a place to run to in times of danger. It’s the place where you live and
love being. Blessed are those who dwell in the LORD’s house – who have His Church as their home. Their
they will find spiritual joy and rest. They will see Christ's forgiving love for them and share that love with
others.
By God’s grace, Immanuel Lutheran Church is such a home for believers. For 150 years, the LORD has
mercifully kept our congregation faithful to him in the administration of his word and sacraments. These
means and God’s blessing are what has transformed this lowly congregation into His house. Blessed are
those who find a home here with the LORD, for they will also receive strength for their journey through
life.
Part Two: We are strengthened for our journey though life
How blessed is the man whose strength is in You, In whose heart are the highways to Zion!
The Jews of Old Testament times had to make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem on certain festival days (like the
Passover) to rejoice in God’s deliverance. Some viewed this pilgrimage as a burden, but believers set their 
heart on the LORD - looking forward to worshipping him at his temple.
Brothers and sisters in Christ our life is like a journey. Blessed are those who embark on it in the strength
of the LORD: always looking to Christ in faith and keeping their eye on the glorious salvation He won for
us. As we look forward to worshipping the LORD in the eternal, heavenly Zion, we understand the
importance of God’s earthly temple (his Church) - taking every opportunity we can to meet him here in
worship.
Passing through the valley of Baca they make it a spring; The early rain also covers it with blessings.
This verse is extremely difficult to understand – mainly because it contains a complex play on Hebrew
words that can’t be translated into English. The basic meaning is this: Even though our journey passes
through times of hardship and trial (the word “Baca” sounds like the Hebrew word for weeping), the Lord
turns these difficulties into blessings. He works in all things for the good of those who love him – using
even the worst of times to draw us closer to him and His Gospel.
They go from strength to strength, Every one of them appears before God in Zion.
No matter how weak a believer seems in life due to the sorrow he may have to experience, the LORD
always strengthens such a person through the ministry of the Gospel that He has entrusted to his Church.
The Word and Sacraments constantly connect us with Christ's forgiving love and wonderful promises.
Through these means the LORD wipes away all our sins and tears - helping us on our journey and giving
us the certain hope that we will appear before His merciful throne in heaven to receive the eternal life he
promised to all who hold on to him in faith.
And the LORD will make sure this happens. Christ’s cross convinces us of this fact! And so we pray with
the Psalmist: O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob!
Brothers and sisters in Christ: the LORD has made Immanuel Lutheran Church His dwelling place, where
He strengthens us for our journey through life. He accomplishes this through the Gospel proclaimed at
every church service and Bible class. He hears all the prayers we offer up on each other's behalf, and uses
us to encourage each other to find strength in him as we travel life’s road towards our heavenly Zion. There
we will receive the full grace and glory that we possess now by faith.
Part Three: We receive divine grace and glory.
The Psalmist prays: Behold our shield, O God, And look upon the face of Your anointed. Israel’s anointed
shield was its king who not only protected God’s people, but also served as a symbol of the coming Christ
who would shield all believers from every evil – delivering them safely through this life home to heaven.
And so we pray that God the Father would listen to His Son (as He intercedes on our behalf) and that He
also listen to every prayer Christ’s Church offers in Jesus name. And why should he? Because we – the
Church - are the body of Christ on this earth through whom Jesus works to accomplish His will. Recognize
this truth and rejoice in the fact that when God looks at us, he sees his Son and loves us. Yes, it is good for
us to belong to his Church – to be in God’s presence – as the Psalmist says:
10 For a day in Your courts is better than a thousand outside. I would rather stand at the threshold of the
house of my God Than dwell in the tents of wickedness.
Yes, even the lowest position in God’s kingdom is far better than living outside of it: at peace with this 
wicked world. No matter how glorious and enduring this evil earth may seem, the Bible says: The world
and its desires pass away, but the man who does the will of God lives forever.iii
And why will the man who does the will of God (which is, to believe in Jesus) live forever? Our Psalm
tells us: For the LORD God is a sun and shield; The LORD gives grace and glory; No good thing does He
withhold from those who walk uprightly.
What a beautiful promise! The LORD, who we meet in this place every time we gather around his Word
and sacraments, is present as our life-giving light – showing us the way of salvation. He is present to shield
us from the devil, world and our own sinful natures. He showers upon us the Gospel of his undeserved love
and bestows on us the great glory of being adopted into his family of believers. He is our Father, and we
are his dearly loved children. He withholds no good thing from those who believe in him – giving us
everything we need in life so that we can spend eternity with Him in glory.
O LORD of hosts, How blessed is the man who trusts in You! Yes, how blest are those who hold on to
Christ in faith. And here’s the thing: this faith is not something we can discover or retain on our own. It is
God’s gift – worked in our hearts through the preaching of the Gospel. And where do we find that Gospel?
We find it in every church that rightly teaches God’s Word and administers His sacraments. The Bible tells
us that the Holy Spirit is wherever these means of grace are rightly used. By God’s grace, Immanuel has
been such a place for the past 150 years!
Brothers and sisters in Christ – we often don’t treasure the things we ought until they are gone. Let this not
be the case regarding our church. Rejoice in the wonderful blessing our congregation is and make use of
every opportunity God gives you to come here to meet with Him. Why? Because The LORD has made
Immanuel a place where . . . we find a home with Him, we are strengthened for our journey through life,
and we receive divine grace and glory.
May the LORD continue to grant his favor upon us, that we may always remain faithful to Him – rejoicing
in all the he accomplishes both in and through us. Amen.",Michael Sullivan,"Kewaunee, WI",8/2/2015,
"Today, we come to the end of the conversation between Jesus and his enemies. This whole
exchange was provoked by his healing of the man who had been lying beside the pool of
Bethesda. And all this took place on the Sabbath.
Verse 18 tell us that our Lord was speaking to people who “were seeking all the more to kill
him.” Verse 19 says, “Jesus said to them…” And what Jesus said to the people who were trying
to kill him, runs all the way from verse 19 down to verse 47.
To get the feel of this you need to picture Jesus speaking to an angry crowd of demonstrators.
This is a hostile environment. The people he speaks to have been offended by him and they
have it in for him. They are not in sympathy with him.
We saw last week that to these people who are so antagonistic toward him, Jesus says, “Truly,
truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He
does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life” (John 5:24).
Every word Jesus speaks here is so that people who hate him may have eternal life. What does
Jesus say so that they may have eternal life? Two things. First, Jesus tells them about himself.
We looked at this last week: Our Lord gives a seven-fold description of how he is one with the
Father. They are one in work, will, and love. They are one in authority, trust, and honor. And
they are one in life.
So how are people who may be antagonistic toward God going to have eternal life? First, they
need to know the truth about Jesus and second, they need to know the truth about themselves.
And that is our focus today.
When Jesus tells the crowd of people who want to kill him the truth about themselves, it is not
pretty. It is not easy to hear, and it must have taken immense courage for our Lord to speak as
he did here.
John has already told us that Jesus is full of grace and truth. The truth is in what he says. The
grace is in why he said it: “I say these things so that you may be saved” (5:34). When Jesus says
the hardest things to you, it is because he seeks the best things for you.
The desire of Jesus, even for people who are openly hostile towards him, is that they should be
saved. All that he says here is spoken to that end. Whenever you find something in the Bible
that offends you, remember that God says these things so that you may be saved.
He Wants You to be Saved
03/05/2017 Scripture: John 5:30-47 Series: Meet Jesus (8/8) By: Colin Smith
2
Before we get into what Jesus said, I want to point out something that will help us to connect
with what he is saying. Notice these words of Jesus about John the Baptist: “He was a burning
and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light” (John 5:35).
John the Baptist was the forerunner of Jesus who prepared the way for him. He called people
to confess their sins and repent. He pointed to Jesus and said “Behold, the Lamb of God, who
takes away the sin of the world… This is he who baptizes in the Holy Spirit” (John 1:29, 33).
Jesus says, “You were willing to rejoice for a while in his light” (5:35). These people once had
light! At one time they were open to the truth. They once found joy in the truth! But now they
are angry with Jesus. They are hostile toward him and ready to be done with him.
This tells us something really important: It is possible for a person to lose the light they once
had. Our Lord makes this very clear later in John’s gospel when he says, “The light is among you
for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you” (John
12:35). That’s what happened to these people. They once walked in the light, but the darkness
has overtaken them.
I want to speak today, especially to all who may be in this position: You once had some interest
in Christian faith. At one time you may have been involved in ministry of one sort or another.
At one time you found joy in this, but that is no longer true of you. Today you are in a different
place: There is a hardness in your heart, a hardness that you may not even be able to explain, or
know how it got there. You may not understand it yourself.
I want you to know the great love Jesus Christ has for you today. He wants you to be saved. He
wants to bring you from that awful state of spiritual death where the judgment of God is before
you, to the new life in which the judgment of God is behind you. And because he loves you, he
speaks the truth to you. That truth may not be easy for you to hear, but it is the truth that can
set you free.
How then can a person be saved? Two headings today: 1. Face the truth about yourself. 2.
Find the truth about Jesus
Face the Truth about Yourself or
(A 7-Part Diagnosis of a Hard Heart)
i. You do not know God
“The Father who sent me has himself borne witness about me. His voice you have
never heard, his form you have never seen…” (John 5:37).
3
This must have been really hard for these folks to hear. These were people who came to
worship and were involved in ministry, and Jesus says to them: “You do not know God.
Everybody thinks you know God, but despite all that you say about God, the truth is that
you don’t know him.”
Here is where you need to begin when your heart is hard and you want to face the truth about
yourself. It is possible to call yourself a Christian when the truth is that you really do not know
God. So stop claiming what’s not true. Face up to the reality that you are actually far from God
and that left to yourself you have no hope of finding him. Thank God you are not left to
yourself. Jesus is reaching out to you even now.
ii. God’s truth is not in you
“You do not have his word abiding in you…” (John 5:38).
These leaders had the Word of God in the Old Testament Scriptures. They were very
familiar with the Bible. They were able to argue from the Bible.
Think about a person who has been in a church where the Bible is preached, a person who
has heard many sermons that are faithful to the Bible. They have heard the truth, but
Jesus says, “God’s Word does not abide in you.”
You hear the truth, but when it touches you, it bounces off you like a billiard ball. The
Word of God does not go in you. You hear it but it does not remain with you. No lasting
impression is made. No lasting change results.
iii. You do not believe
“You do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe the one whom he has
sent” (John 5:38).
Notice the word ‘for.’ Why is it that God’s Word does not abide in you? Because you do not
believe the one whom he has sent.
Why is it that some people who profess to be Christians never seem to grow? They go to Bible
studies. They get involved in ministry. They have Christian friends. But the Word does not
seem to bear fruit in their lives. Why is that? Jesus says, “[It is because] you do not believe the
one whom he has sent” (5:38).
Turn that around: If you were to really start believing and trusting in Jesus. If you were to start
looking to him to bring change in your life, and you were to start believing that he can and that
he will, then the Word of God that has been bouncing off you without making any impression
would start to go in. It would remain in you. It would abide in you and it would begin to
change your life.
iv. You are unwilling to come to Jesus 
4
“You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it
is they that bear witness about me, yet you refuse to come to me that you may have
life” (John 5:39-40).
Jesus is saying to people who once had light and joy in the truth, but who now have an
inner folding of the arms: “This is why you have lost the light and the joy that you had: You
are determined not to come to me!” What kept them from coming to Jesus?
They were hung up on the fact that Jesus had healed this man on the Sabbath. Really?
Lose the light and the joy that you once had over that? Maybe there is something in your
life that has caused you to be offended by Jesus. Is it really worth all that you are losing
now and all that you will lose in the future to stay offended by Jesus?
John the Baptist had a marvelous ministry. Jesus said on one occasion that there was none
greater. But when he faced something really hard in his life, John the Baptist, who had
proclaimed Jesus so wonderfully to others, began to have doubts himself. Dark times can come
to God’s best servants. So don’t be surprised when they come.
John sent messengers to Jesus: “Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?”
(Mat. 11:3). Do you remember the message Jesus sent back? “Blessed is the one who is not
offended by me” (Mat. 11:6).
The most miserable place in life is when you are holding onto a grievance against Jesus. If you
take offense at Jesus, you will lose the light and joy that you had. Whatever he has allowed in
your life, being in a stand-off with him will only make your pain greater.
Jesus says, “You refuse to come to me that you may have life.” You could have life! There is a
peace, a strength, a joy that could be yours, but it’s not yours and the reason it’s not yours is
that you have taken offense at me, and so you refuse to come to me.
v. You do not love God
“I know that you do not have the love of God within you” (John 5:42).
This is why your heart is so hard. You may congratulate yourself on all kinds of good things
that you do, but you don’t have the first thing that God requires of you. You do not have
the love of God in you. If you did, your heart would not be hard.
vi. You seek the wrong kind of glory
“How can you believe, when you receive glory from one another and do not seek the
glory that comes from the only God?” (John 5:44).
Jesus says, “You receive glory from one another.” What matters to you is what other
people think. It’s all about the impression you make. You are looking for your “well done”
5
in the wrong place. You want to find it in people being impressed with you. How can you
believe, if that’s how it is with you? That’s what Jesus is saying.
Notice the emotion of Jesus here: We all love the stories where Jesus wonderfully reaches a lost
person. His masterful leading of Nicodemus, who eventually came to faith in Jesus. His
winsome winning of the woman at the well, whose testimony led many people in her home
town to believe. And we say, “Here’s how you should do evangelism!” But some people were
not won… even by the sustained witness of the Son of God himself!
You may have a loved one who is far from God, whose heart is hard. Their hostility toward
Jesus overflows in hostility towards you. You feel like you are walking on egg shells with them.
And you find yourself thinking, If only I could find the right words to say that would break
through this hardness of heart. But you never seem to find the right words. Maybe if they read
this book or heard that sermon… But nothing gets through to them.
The Son of God has been there. You can say to him, “Jesus, you know what this is like! You
know how painful it is when someone you love has a hard heart. You have been there in your
perfect life. Please help me because I am here right now in my very imperfect life.”
vii. Your hope is misplaced
“Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you:
Moses, on whom you have set your hope” (John 5:45).
Here are people who have set their own hope on their own virtue. Their hope is that they
can live a life that will be good enough for God. But that hope is misplaced.
A successful man came to Jesus on one occasion and asked him, “What must I do to have
eternal life?” (Mark 10:17). Then after Jesus recounted the commandments, the man said, “All
these I have kept since I was a boy.”
Here was a man whose hope was set on Moses. His hope was that he had kept all of the
commandments. But the truth was that he had kept none of the commandments. He hadn’t
even kept the first command: “You shall have no other gods before me” (Ex. 20:3). His life was
about himself. He was his own god. His hope was misplaced.
So let’s put together what Jesus is saying here to these people whose hearts are hard:
You once had light. You once had joy. But you have lost the light and joy that you had. And
here’s where you are now: You don’t know God. The truth is not in you. You don’t believe.
You have no desire to come to me. You don’t love God. You seek the wrong kind of glory. Your
hope is completely and utterly misplaced. And, I say this so that you should be saved!
I want you to know God. I want the truth to abide in you. I want you to believe in me and come
to me. I want you to have the love of God in your heart. I want you to share the glory that
comes from God alone. And I want you to have a hope that can never be shaken!
6
Only a Savior who loves would speak like this to his enemies! When they took offense at him,
Jesus could easily have walked away and ignored them. There were other times when that
happened. When Jesus stood before King Herod, he did not speak a single word. Herod had
rejected the truth to the point where Christ had no further word for him. That’s devastating!
But there is hope for these hard-hearted people in John 5. Jesus was speaking to them and
Jesus is speaking to us today through his word in John 5.
So what are we to do? At this point, it would be very easy for a preacher to say what everyone
would expect: “Repent and believe.” But Jesus is not saying that here. So let me, in these last
moments, lay out the path that Jesus prescribes for hard hearts.
Find the Truth about Jesus
It is very striking to me that Jesus keeps pointing to the Scriptures:
God has spoken in the Scripture
“You do not have his word abiding in you…” (John 5:38).
Scripture is God’s Word. It is not our word about God, it is God’s word to us. This is how
you come to know God. And if you really come to know him, you will come to love him.
And if you love him, you will come to Christ who he has sent. You will believe in him, and
then your hope will be well placed and you will live to seek his glory!
The whole of Scripture points to Jesus Christ
“You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it
is they that bear witness about me” (John 5:39).
“For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me” (John 5:46).
These are marvelous statements from our Lord himself about how the whole of Scripture is
about him. The Scriptures “bear witness about me” (5:39). Moses “wrote of me” (5:46)!
There’s a warning here about the dangers of a diminished view of Scripture that that I don’t
want you to miss. Many people who profess to be Christians would say that they believe in the
Bible, but they “don’t buy all that stuff about inerrancy.” So what happens is that people start
chipping away at the Bible. They see it as a book that contains many wonderful things,
especially about Jesus, but they do not receive it as the very word of God.
Notice what Jesus says here: “If you believed Moses, you would believe me.” If you lose
confidence in the Old Testament, it won’t be long before you lose confidence in Jesus as well. 
7
“Moses wrote about me! If you don’t believe Moses, you won’t believe me!” If you come to
the Bible as a critic, the Bible will be a closed book to you. Your heart will be as hard at the end
as it was at the beginning.
If you are going to move beyond hardness of heart, you have to humble yourself before God,
and open his Word with an honest recognition of your true position before him: God, I don’t
even know you, so I need you to make yourself known to me through your Word. Lord, the
truth is not in me – I need you to teach me through your Word. Lord, I do not have faith – I
need you to give me faith through your Word. Lord, the inclination of my heart is to turn from
you – create a new desire in me through your Word.
Lord, I do not have your love in my heart. Show me the love of Christ and pour out that love
into my heart by your Holy Spirit. Lord, I have been seeking the wrong kind of glory, so create
within me a new heart that seeks the glory that comes from you alone. Lord, I have put my
hope in all the wrong places, lead me to a hope that will not be put to shame.
Face the truth about yourself. Find the truth about Jesus. The Savior says these things so that
you may be saved.
",Colin Smith,"Barrington, IL",3/5/2017,
"Please open your Bible at John 5.
We looked last week at the marvelous story of how Jesus healed a man who had languished
beside the pool of Bethesda. He was without strength and without hope. When Jesus asked
him, “Do you want to be healed?” the best he could do was to explain why he had no hope.
Far from securing the man’s cooperation in the healing, Jesus question made it clear that this
man had nothing to contribute. He had no strength, and he had no hope.
Then Jesus spoke the word of command: “Get up, take up your bed, and walk” (5:8). When
Jesus spoke these words, a new power, a new ability, a new capacity came to the man that he
did not have before. And we read that “At once the man was healed, and he took up his bed
and walked” (5:9).
Today we come to the sequel to this marvelous story. One writer says that the words before us
today are “probably the most important truth ever uttered upon earth.” 1
Bishop Ryle says, “Nowhere else in the Gospels do we find our Lord making such a formal,
systematic, orderly, regular statement of His own unity with the Father… as we find in this
discourse.”
2
Our series is called Meet Jesus. The verses before us today are the clearest statement of who
Jesus is, in his own words anywhere in the Gospels. If you want to help someone understand
who Jesus is in his deity, this is the place to start. Our focus today will be on who Jesus is and
what Jesus gives.
Who Jesus Is
He was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God (John 5:18).
The background to this is that Jesus healed the man by the pool on the Sabbath. When the
man took up his bed and walked, he was challenged by the religious leaders of the day for
carrying a load on the Sabbath day. When the man reported that it was Jesus who told him to take up his bed and walk, the
religious authorities went after Jesus with the accusation that Jesus was breaking the Sabbath.
“This was why the Jews were persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things on the
Sabbath” (5:16).
The Sabbath day was instituted in the fourth commandment, “Remember the Sabbath day, to
keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to
the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work…” (Ex. 20:8-10).
But the principle of the Sabbath went all the way back to creation, where God rested on the
seventh day. In six days, God did his marvelous work of creation and on the seventh day God
rested from his work of creation, because his work of creating was completed. It did not mean
that God ceased from all activity.
It was clearly understood among God’s people that God must be exempt from his own Sabbath
law. How else could the universe continue? The sun rises and the rain falls by God’s power and
command. If God did not work on the Sabbath, there would not be a Sabbath! So it was
understood that God while everyone else rested on the Sabbath, God alone was working. Only
God works on the Sabbath!
Against that background, notice what Jesus says on the Sabbath day, “My Father is working
until now, and I am working” (5:17). There was no doubt and no ambiguity about what Jesus
was saying here: “Only God works on the Sabbath. I am working on the Sabbath. Go figure!”
That’s what he is saying!
And that is exactly what they did. “This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him,
because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father,
making himself equal with God” (John 5:18).
Notice the words “making himself equal with God.” It is not the case that Jesus was a
remarkable person and that the church then imposed on him the idea that he was the Son of
God. This was his own claim, clearly articulated and clearly understood, and it was for this
reason that he was crucified! There is a myth that is often repeated, “How did Jesus become
God?” The real question is, “How did God become Jesus?”
Notice too that our Lord does not say, “O, you misunderstood me. I didn’t mean that I am
equal with God, I just meant that I am here to do his work like all of you.” He does the
opposite, piling on statement after statement, laying out to an audience of people who want to
kill him, what being equal with God actually means! What follows is the most marvelous
statement of how God the Father and God the Son are wonderfully and perfectly one.
What does a more perfect union look like? The preamble to the constitution of the United
States lays out the purpose of our constitution, and the first of these is the pursuit of a more 
3
perfect union. “We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union… do
ordain and establish this constitution for the United States of America.”
What does a perfect union look like? The answer is right here in John 5. If you want to know
what it means to be one, you can’t do better than to look at the perfect union of God the
Father and God the Son.
There is a marvelous application here to marriage. “‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and
his mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh’? So they are no longer
two but one flesh” (Mat. 19:5-6).
What does it mean to be one? What would it look like for a husband and wife to move toward
a more perfect union? Brace yourself for a mini marriage seminar from the words of Jesus on
what it means to be one in John 5!
7 Dimensions of the Union of the Father and the Son
1. The Son is one with the Father in work
Jesus answered them, “My Father is working until now, and I am working”
(John 5:17).
What is he saying? The Father and Son share the same work. They have different roles in
the work: The Son did not send himself into the world, the Father did. The Father did not
die on the cross, the Son did. There are different roles, but what the Father does and what
the Son does align together in one great work, which is to redeem the world.
Think about that in relation to marriage. Here is a great conversation for a date night! You are
doing this work and I am doing that work, but what is the great work that we are doing
together? What is the great work that we share to which each of our individual parts
contributes? The oneness of the Father and the Son lies in sharing the same work.
2. The Son is one with the Father in will
Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but
only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, that the Son does
likewise” (John 5:19).
Jesus does not act independently of the Father. The Son has not come into the world to
“do his own thing.” The Son sees what the Father is doing. The Son pays attention to what
the Father is doing and follows the lead.
There is something beautiful about two dancers who really know what they are doing moving
together. The eye of the one is on the other, and the two move as one intuitively. That how it 
4
is with the Father and the Son.
3. The Son is one with the Father in love
“The Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing” (John 5:20).
Love gives and it does not hold back. Love means that there are no secrets between the
Father and the Son. The Father shows the Son all that he is doing. So true oneness
involves a continuing communication in which all that is going on in one life is opened up
to the other.
A perfect union would mean that a husband would never say to his wife, “I had no idea that this
was going on in your mind and in your heart, why did you not tell me?” A more perfect union
would mean that a wife would never say to her husband, “I did not tell you because I did not
think you would want to know or that you would understand.” A more perfect union involves
this kind of loving communication, this opening up of life to one another.
4. The Son is one with the Father in authority
“As the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he
will” (John 5:21).
Raising the dead involves the authoritative exercise of sovereign power. The Father and
the Son are one in the exercise of this authority. What the Father does, the Son does.
A more perfect union is one in which a mother and a father are one in exercising authority.
They do not issue conflicting commands, which always causes chaos and confusion. Their
authority moves as one in the same direction.
5. The Son is one with the Father in trust
“The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son” (John 5:22).
Maybe you know what it is to be given a task and then the one who delegated it to you
ended up doing it himself or herself. When that happens there is an issue of trust.
There could hardly be a task of greater significance than bringing justice to the entire world. All
throughout the Old Testament we are told that God is the judge. And here we are told that the
Father has given all judgment to the Son. That means people of every religion (and no religion)
will one day stand before and give account to Jesus Christ who died for sins.
Applied to marriage, a more perfect union means that you have full confidence in the one with
whom you have been made one, that you communicate that confidence both by trusting things
of great importance to that person, and that you do not take back what has been trusted by
doing it yourself. 
5
6. The Son is one with the Father in honor
“The Father… has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they
honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who
sent him” (John 5:23).
The perfect union of the Father and the Son is seen in the resolve of the Father that the
Son may be held in the highest honor. When you honor Jesus Christ you honor the Father.
Whenever we worship the Son, the Father is honored. If that were not so, our worship
would be blasphemy. “Every knee will bow… and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus
Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father” (Phil. 2:10).
Here is another dimension of what a more perfect union looks like: You speak, think and act in
such a way that the one you love will know that he or she is held in honor.
7. The Son is one with the Father in life
“For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in
himself” (John 5:26).
The perfect union of the Father and the Son is seen in a shared life. The Father has life in
himself, and the Son has life in himself.
Your life began through the union of your father and your mother. You were conceived.
Before that you were not, and without that you would not have been! Life comes to us,
but it is not like that for God. God has life in himself, and this is true of the Son as it is true
of the Father.
Now the words “He has granted the Son to have life in himself,” are very important and here is
what they tell us: The Father has granted that the Son is the one who holds the gift of life in his
hand! He has this gift. He has it in himself, and it is for this reason that “the Son gives life to
whom he will” (5:21).
So try to take in this glimpse of the glory of Jesus Christ. He is one with the Father in work, in
will, and in love. He is one with the Father in authority, in trust, and in honor. He is one with
the Father in sharing the same self-sustaining life, and the Father has granted to him that,
having the life of God in himself, he is the one who is able to give it to others.
We have the most glorious Savior! That’s who Jesus is – God with us, God for us, God laying
claim to our love, our trust, our obedience, and our worship.
By the way, to those of you who are not yet married, but hope to one day be – isn’t this a great
vision of a more perfect union? Wouldn’t you like to have someone bow before you, look at
the vision of John 5 and say, “Let’s go after that!”?
6
What Jesus Gives
“Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has
eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life” (John
5:24).
These are amazing words. Here is the Son of God, who has life in himself (5:26). He is able
to give life to whom he will (5:21). The life that he has is eternal, and here he speaks about
how this eternal life can be ours!
When Jesus speaks about death and life, he is speaking about something in which all of us are
involved. Nobody can say, “This isn’t relevant to me.” Life and death are the experience of
every person, in every generation, in every culture. The experience of life and of death may be
very different but these are the two great realities that every person on the planet will
experience and that no person on the planet can avoid.
Now what is death? When you know what death is, then you will know what life is. We
normally think about death as something that is pronounced by a doctor when the vital signs of
life have ceased. When the heart no longer beats, the lungs no longer breathe, and
the brain no longer sends its animating signals throughout the body, then a person is
pronounced to be dead.
But the Bible speaks about death in another way. The first time death is mentioned in the Bible
is in Genesis 2:17 where God says, “In the day that you eat of it [the tree of the knowledge of
good and evil] you shall surely die.”
You remember the story of how Adam and Eve sinned when they disobeyed this single
command of God. At the end of that day when Adam sinned, his heart was still beating, his
lungs were still breathing, and his brain was still sending animating signals throughout his body.
So, he didn’t die? Or did he? O, yes he did!
Here’s where you need to come to a biblical definition of what death is. What happened on the
day that Adam and Eve sinned? They came under the judgment and the condemnation of God.
And that is what death is in the Bible. It is to come under the judgment and condemnation of
God.
You can see that here right in this verse: “Whoever hears my word and believes him who sent
me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment [that’s what death is!], but has passed
from death to life” (5:24). Why does Jesus bring in death here? Because, biblically, that is what
death is – to come under the judgment of God.
Jesus is describing something very wonderful. By nature, all of us live with death ahead of us.
7
We live until we die. “It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment”
(Heb. 9:27). What kind of life is that? To pass from life to death to judgment would be a grim
future. But here Jesus speaks about a person who has passed from death to life!
What we know is a life where death is ahead of us, but Jesus speaks of a life where death is
behind us, a life where the judgment and condemnation of God lies not in the future but in the
past! How would that be possible?
When the Son of God went to the cross, the sins of all who would believe were laid on him. All
the judgment and condemnation that was due to us was poured out on him. If your judgment
was spent, exhausted, emptied out, and absorbed in Christ back there on the cross, then if you
are in him, you will not come into judgment. And if there is no condemnation from God ahead
of you, you can truly be said to have passed from death to life!
Brother, sister in Christ – there is no condemnation for you in the future because it has already
been dealt with by Jesus in the past! “There is therefore now no condemnation for those who
are in Christ Jesus” (Rom. 8:1). We have passed from death to life! Life, as we know it, is life
with death and judgment before you. But Jesus speak here about eternal life, which is life with
death and judgment behind you!
So what happens to a believer when your heart stops beating, and your lungs stop breathing,
and your brain stops sending signals to the rest of your body? To be away from the body is to
be at home with the Lord. Which is better by far! (2 Cor. 5:8).
In a world where, every day, thousands of people are passing from life to death, Jesus has come
so that, through faith in him, we may pass from death to life! When you hear this good news
don’t you feel motivated to tell others? “I’ve got to tell people what life is! I went into church
today thinking that death and judgment were ahead of me, and I went out knowing that eternal
life is ahead of me because of Jesus Christ.”
Jesus says, “Whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life. He does
not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life!” (John 5:24).

"So Jesus was back in Jerusalem. He had been there before, and had performed miracles, though
John does not record for us what they were. He then went north through Samaria, where he
met the woman at the well and saw a great spiritual harvest in the town of Sychar,
where many people confessed him as the Savior of the world.
After two days in Sychar, our Lord went north to Cana in Galilee, and there he healed the son of
a royal official, who was languishing at the point of death in Capernaum, twenty miles away. It
was an awesome display of the authority of Jesus, who is able to command what he wills and
he wills what he commands.
Now, Jesus was back in Jerusalem, and he came to this pool of Bethesda. So picture a pool. It is
a natural pool of water, quite deep and outdoors. Beside this pool, there are five pillars
supporting a roof that provides shade from the heat of the sun.
Around the pool, “lay a multitude of invalids—blind, lame and paralyzed” (5:3). The reason they
were there becomes clear in verse 7, where were learn that from time to time the water was
“stirred up.” Most likely there was an underground stream that periodically bubbled up. When
this happened, the pool would have looked like a Jacuzzi.
We don’t know how often this happened, but it must have been often enough to keep the
crowd coming. The waters may have been stirred up a few times each day, like going to
Yellowstone National Park and seeing Old Faithful, which bubbles up every 20 minutes or so.
It must have been quite a scene when the Jacuzzi got going, with scores of people piling in from
all sides of the pool. Those who were able to do so, jumped in themselves, while others were
being helped in by friends and relatives. And then when the bubbling stopped, everyone got
out again.
I suspect that most of the people there viewed it as a kind of therapy pool: “Get in the bubbling
water. It will be good for you.” Clearly that would be true, especially for people with aching
limbs and other difficulties.
But over the years, stories had circulated to the effect that the first person to get into the water
when it bubbled would be healed. It was what we might call a “local myth,” well maintained by
the community.
He Gives Strength
02/19/2017 Scripture: John 5:1-17 Series: Meet Jesus (6/8) By: Colin Smith
2
You know how these stories get around: “My friend at work told me that she knows someone
whose mother’s cousin was healed at the pool of Bethesda. She was the first one in.” And so
the myth was sustained, and the crowds kept coming
Where would Scottish tourism be without the Loch Ness monster? If you were to ask, “Pastor
Colin, do you believe in the Loch Ness monster?” I can tell you today that I personally have a
photograph of the Loch Ness monster.
I took the photo myself from a boat on Loch Ness that conveniently provides a window with a
black sticker in the shape of the monster. If you take a picture of the water through the
window, you can bring home your very own picture of the Loch Ness monster. Never ask a
Scotsman to deny the Loch Ness monster. It’s bad for business.
Wherever there is a myth there will be a crowd, and where there is a crowd there are
opportunities to make money. The pool of Bethesda would have been a great spot for vendors.
“Come and see the bubbling waters! Rent a chair and shelter under our unique pillar-supported
roof. Snacks, lunches and cold drinks are available throughout the day.”
Every day these vendors have a guaranteed crowd gathered by the pool, tourists hoping they
would be lucky enough to see the waters bubble, working people who wanted to sit down and
take a break from the heat of the sun, and a multitude of people suffering from all kinds of
conditions who hoped that a dip in the bubbling water would do them some good.
A Depiction of the Human Condition
i. Without strength
One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years (John 5:5).
The attention of Jesus was drawn to one man. We read in other stories of the compassion of
Jesus for huge crowds of people, but here the eyes and heart of the Son of God are drawn to
one man. There was nothing to make him stand out from scores of others who would also have
been lying on mats round the pool. He would have been lost in the crowd to us, but no one is
ever lost in the crowd to Jesus.
We are not told the nature of his condition. “Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had
already been there a long time” (5:6). Most likely he suffered from some form of lameness or
partial paralysis, because Jesus says to him, “Take up your bed, and walk” (5:8). The man did
have some movement because when he explains to Jesus why he was never the first in the
pool, he says, “While I am going another steps down before me” (5:7).
Try to take in what this man’s difficult and sad life was like. Every day he makes his way to the
therapy pool, marks out his spot, and lies down on his mat. When the waters stir, he gets in.
When he gets out, his condition is the same as it was before. His best hope in life is a myth –
3
that something amazing might happen if he could be the first to get in, but that was beyond his
ability.
And this had been the man’s life for 38 years. So this was a man in his fifties or perhaps even
older. His whole life has been one of frustration – a daily routine of getting to the pool, waiting
for the waters to stir, getting into the Jacuzzi, getting out, getting dried, getting home, and
coming back again the next day.
ii. Without hope
When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time,
he said to him, “Do you want to be healed?” (John 5:6).
That is an interesting question. I wonder why you think he asked it. Anyone who has ever
counselled another person knows how important it is to have the person engage in the
therapeutic process. So you say, “I need you to work with me here. You need to look at
where you are and where you want to be, and then decide if you want to move forward.
I’m ready to walk with you, but I can’t help you if you don’t engage.”
We depend on something coming from within the person themselves in order for progress to
be made. The counsellor’s role may be to strengthen and support a person’s desire to get
better. The counsellor may give light, direction and understanding in the process, but we do not
have the power to change another person’s life.
And if a person does not want to get better, there is very little that those who love that person
and seek to come alongside them can do. Many of us have discovered this in our own families.
That is our reality, and so it is natural for us to think that this is how it is for God.
That is why people say, “God helps those who helps themselves.” This makes sense to us
because the only people we are able to help are the people who are ready to help themselves.
And if that’s true for us, we assume that it must also be true of God.
This question of Jesus is often psychologized, as if Jesus was trying to elicit the cooperation of
this man in his own healing. William Barclay writes in his commentary, “It is as if Jesus said to
this man: ‘Make a supreme effort and you and I will do this thing together!’” 1
How Barclay could have got that from this story is completely beyond me. Actually, I do know.
As brilliant and insightful as he was as a bible scholar, he did not believe in miracles. But far
from making a supreme effort, the obvious point of the story is that this man was completely
without strength and without hope. This man is so overwhelmed by his own problem that he does not even answer Jesus question.
When Jesus says, “Do you want to be healed?” the man responds by telling Jesus why he can’t
be, and why he doesn’t have any hope: “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the
water is stirred up” (5:7).
So what he does here is explain why there is no hope for him: “Here’s the problem. Here is the
thing that I cannot get beyond. Here is why I have not been able to make progress and why I
cannot move forward now. Life is never going to be different for me. I had hopes and dreams of
what my life might be, but it isn’t going to happen.”
I wonder if you can hear an echo of your own voice here – your story of something that was
done to you, your disappointment in someone who let you down, your journey that has led you
to a place where you no longer have hope. So, if someone asked you, “Do you want to be
well?” your response would be to explain why that is not possible for you.
iii. Without faith
Notice, after the healing the man is asked, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed
and walk’” (5:12). John tells us, “The man who had been healed did not know who it was!”
(5:13), and that was after he had been healed!
Far from having great faith in Jesus, this man does not even know who Jesus is. It’s not until
verse 14, where Jesus catches up with him in the temple that the man finds out who has healed
him. This is in marked contrast to other stories in the Gospels, when faith, very clearly, has a
participating role.
Last week we looked at the story of the royal official who walked 20 miles in order to ask Jesus
to heal his son. There was genuine faith there, and Jesus healed the man’s son. There is also a
story about a centurion, a man of great faith, who said: “Only say the word, and my servant will
be healed” (Mat. 8:8).
There are other stories where Jesus clearly acknowledges the role of faith in a person being
healed. To the woman with the hemorrhage, he says, “Your faith has made you well” (Mark
5:34, see also Mark 10:52). On another occasion our Lord said to two men who were blind,
“According to your faith be it unto you” (Mat. 9:29).
But there is no way that Jesus could have said these things here. This man shows no evidence of
faith whatsoever! He is overwhelmed by his own problem – without strength, without hope,
and without faith. Even after he is healed, he does not know who Jesus is.
So when Jesus says, “Do you want to be healed?” he makes it clear that this man has nothing to
offer! There is surely no way that he is saying, “Make a supreme effort, and you and I will do
this together.” 
5
What hope can there be for a person without strength, hope, and faith? How does this cycle get
broken? How does this story speak to us? Jesus comes to this person who is without strength,
hope, or faith – a man who has been like this for years – and wonderfully heals him.
A Demonstration of Divine Power
Jesus said to him, “Get up, take up your bed, and walk.” And at once the man was
healed, and he took up his bed and walked (John 5:8-9).
What an amazing miracle this was! Everyone over the age of about 40 knows that when
you have been in a car for hours your muscles are tight and your joints are stiff when you
get out. Imagine the condition of this man’s muscles and joints after 38 years of restricted
movement!
Jesus says, “Take up your bed and walk,” and John tells us that the man “took up his bed
and walked.” No physical therapy! Christ infused strength into his body. Joints are instantly
strengthened. Muscles are instantly formed. And a man who had been lying on a bed for
38 years gets up and walks! Only the Son of God himself could do such a thing!
Remember that these miracles are presented to us as signs. What we see in this sign is that
when Jesus speaks a command, he gives what is lacking so that what he wills comes to pass.
Augustine said to God, “Command what you will; only give what you command.” What he was
saying was something like this: “Lord, you can command what you want, but the problem is
that I do not have the capacity to do what you command.”
? “You can say to me that I must love you with all my heart, but I don’t have that in me.”

? “You can tell me to love my neighbor as myself, but I love myself more.”
? “When you tell me to repent, but I find that I want to hold onto my sins.”
? “When you tell me to believe, I find that I am more inclined to trust myself, or my
friends, or my money than to trust in you.”
Augustine was saying, “So, you can command what you will, but the only way anything good is
ever going to happen in my life is if you give what you command!”
Can you see that this is exactly what Jesus does here? Our Lord gives a command that is
absolutely impossible for this man: “Take up your bed and walk.” And with the command, he
gave the man an ability that he did not have before. So, to his own great surprise, the man who
was without strength, without hope, and even without faith, finds that he now has the capacity
to respond to the word of Jesus. 
6
“At once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked” (5:9). The point of this story
is not that faith makes what Jesus does possible. The point is that what Jesus does makes faith
possible.
The good news for the person who is without strength, without hope, or without faith today is
that Jesus Christ can give these to you! And when he calls you to believe, he gives the capacity
with the command.
This takes us back to the great theme announced at the beginning of John’s Gospel that we
picked up on last week – “The law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through
Jesus Christ” (John 1:17).
The fact that this man had been suffering for 38 years would surely have brought to mind for
any thinking Jewish readers, and for anyone familiar with the Old Testament, another story
about languishing in frustration for 38 years.
Moses led God’s people to the edge of the Promised Land. They sent out spies into the land,
who came back with a report that the land was flowing with milk and honey. But there were
also giants in the land, and the majority report was that God’s people were simply not strong
enough to take possession of the land. Caleb and Joshua made the case that God was with his
people, and that he would give them the ability to possess the land.
But the people turned back and wandered in the desert, without strength, without hope, and
without faith. How long did that go on? “And the time from our leaving Kadesh-barnea until we
crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that is, the men of
war, had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them” (Dt. 2:14).
The wandering and frustration lasted 38 years! And they never got in. Moses got a glimpse of
the Promised Land, but even he died in the desert. The law gives you a view of the blessed life
that God calls you to lead. But only Jesus can bring you into that life. That is what he came into
the world to do.
Here is the difference between Jesus and the law: The law tells you what to do, but it can’t give
you the power to do it. Jesus tells you what to do, and he gives you the power to do it. That is
where strength, hope, and faith begin. It begins because the Son of God has come. It does not
begin in us. It begins in him.
Listen to how the apostle Paul puts it: “God has done what the law… could not do” (Rom. 8:3).
What could the law not do? The law could not forgive past sins and it could not empower
future obedience.
7
So, how did God do what the law could not do? He did it “by sending his own Son…” What did
the Son of God do, that would forgive past sins and empower future obedience?
? “He condemned sin in the flesh” (Rom. 8:3). By dying on the cross, where his flesh was
torn and his blood was shed, Jesus Christ made provision for all of our past sins.
? But it does not end there. He rose from the dead, and as the living Lord and the
ascended Savior, he works by his Holy Spirit to give strength, hope, and faith.
? He did all this “in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in
us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit” (Rom. 8:3-4).
Good news for the person without strength, hope, or faith
I was reading this week about a woman who endured a long period of darkness and depression.
When, by God’s grace, she finally got relief, this was her testimony: “I realized after all these
years that I was looking to find in myself what I needed to find in him.”
The good news for the person without strength, without hope, and without faith today does
not lie in you. It lies in Jesus. There is a Savior who can be trusted, and in him there is hope and
there is strength for you.
“These are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by
believing you may have life in his name” (John 20:31). There is a Savior whose Word brings
strength to the powerless, hope to the hopeless, and faith to the faithless. May his Word bring
new strength, new hope, and new faith to all of us today. ",Colin Smith,"Barrington, IL",2/19/2017,
"The “two days” are a reference to the two days Jesus spent in the Samaritan town of Sychar,
where there had been a remarkable spiritual movement in a place where you would least
expect it. “Many Samaritans… believed in him. They asked him to stay… and he stayed there
two days. And many more believed because of his word” (4:39, 40, 41).
And those who believed made a marvelously clear profession of faith: “We know that this is
indeed the Savior of the world” (4:42). You can’t get a clearer confession of faith than that. So
now after these two marvelous days in which Jesus had seen a great spiritual harvest, our Lord
left Sychar and continued his journey north to Galilee.
Christ was back among his own people. John tells us that the people of Galilee “welcomed
him,” but then he adds: “having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they
too had gone to the feast” (4:45).
Jesus did not perform any miracles in Samaria, and yet there was a spiritual harvest of many
people who “believed because of his word” (4:41). But when our Lord came to Galilee, he was
welcomed by people who knew about the miracles he had performed in Jerusalem. So they
had an expectation that he would do the same in Galilee.
John records seven miracles of Jesus, which he calls ‘signs.’ Turning water into wine was the
first sign (John 2:11). “He came again to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine”
(4:46). And the story we are following today was the second sign (4:54).
The Man from Capernaum
So Jesus was in Cana, and John tells us that “at Capernaum [about 20 miles away] there was an
official whose son was ill” (4:46).
The word translated ‘official’ in verse 46 is important here. The Greek word for a king was
basileus. This man is described as a basilikos [literally, a little king!]. Someone who served the
king, or we might say, “a member of the royal household.”
This man walked the corridors of power. Some have suggested that this might have been
Herod’s household manager, a man named Chuza. In Luke 8:3 we read of “Joanna, the wife of
Chuza, Herod’s household manager… who provided for them [Jesus and the disciples] out of
their means.” This same Joanna was among the women who went to anoint the body of Jesus
with spices and found that the tomb was empty (Luke 24:10).
He Can Be Trusted
02/12/2017 Scripture: John 4:43-54 Series: Meet Jesus (5/8) By: Colin Smith
2
We don’t know if this is the story of how Chuza and Joanna came to faith in Christ, but it is the
story of a royal person, a member of the King’s household who, along with his entire family
(4:53), came to believe in Jesus.
So here we have a man who could be described as a little king! He lives a life of privilege. He
walks the corridors of power. He has his own servants (plural; 4:51), and with all of his
responsibility, he is rewarded with a handsome salary.
But this man carried a great burden – his son was ill (4:46). Suffering comes to the rich as well
as the poor, and for all his power and wealth, the Royal Official had not been able to help his
own son. Worse than that, his son was at the point of death (4:47).
So, this is the story of a desperate father and a dying son. Everyone who has lost a son or
daughter will resonate with this story. You know what this father felt – the fear, the pain, and
the sense of helplessness.
His interaction with Jesus
When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked
him to come down and heal his son (John 4:47).
The Royal Official would have known very little about Jesus. But word had got around in
Galilee, from locals who had gone to the feast in Jerusalem, that a person by the name of Jesus
had performed miracles.
Apparently these stories had reached the palace, and when the Royal Official heard that Jesus
was in Cana, he left his home in Capernaum and travelled the 20 miles to ask if Jesus would
come to his home and heal his son.
I think it says a lot for this man that with his son near the point of death, he would leave his
home, his wife and the sick boy and travel 20 miles to find Jesus. But when he arrives and
makes his request, the first word he hears from Jesus is not encouraging. “Jesus said to him,
‘Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe’” (4:48).
This seems to be a word of rebuke: “If you could find any other cure for your son’s condition
you would not have come to me.” And, of course, that was probably true. The Royal Official
did not come to Cana because he had a special interest in Jesus. He came simply because he
was desperate.
God uses all kinds of circumstances to begin a work of grace in a person’s life. Many of you
know this from your own experience. You did not come to Jesus with the highest of motives.
You came because you were desperate, and that was the beginning of you seeking after and
then following Jesus Christ.
3
To the Royal Official’s credit, he refuses to be put off. He repeats his request. “Sir, come down
before my child dies” (4:49).
The Royal Official thought that for his son to be healed, he needed to persuade Jesus to travel
20 miles and come to his house. But Jesus does not need to travel 20 miles to heal the boy.
Jesus says to him, “Go; your son will live” (4:50).
This tells us something very wonderful about the authority of Jesus. What Jesus says happens.
If he says, “Your sins are forgiven,” your sins are forgiven. If he says, “Your son will live,” your
son will live.
If Jesus stands at a graveside and says, “Lazarus, come forth,” Lazarus will come forth. And
when he calls out “Rise!” on the last day, every grave will be emptied. It follows, of course, that
if on the last day, Christ should say to any of us, “You are condemned,” we would be
condemned. He is the sovereign Lord and no one resists his will.
Jesus said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me” (Mat. 28:18). Having
been raised by the Father from the dead, Jesus has been given the name that is above all
names, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow (Phil. 2:9-10). Here Jesus speaks these
wonderful words of grace: “Your son will live.”
Taking Jesus at His Word
The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him
and went on his way (John 4:50).
Now we learn later (4:53), that when Jesus said this, the fever left the boy who was lying in his
bed 20 miles away. Imagine the scene of wonder, astonishment, and joy in the home. The boy
has been languishing in bed. His temperature keeps rising and they can’t get it to go down.
Then at around one o’clock, suddenly, the boy feels better.
He shouts to his mother who feels his forehead, and sure enough his temperature has returned
to normal. The boy gets up and puts on his clothes. The servants don’t know what to say.
Everyone in the household is rejoicing! But they have no idea of how or why this has
happened!
The boy’s father is 20 miles from home in Cana. He doesn’t have a cell phone! His wife cannot
text him with the news! All the Father has is the bare word of Jesus, which he believes: “Your
son will live.” Faith trusts Christ by resting on his word. That is how the Samaritans came to
faith. That’s what faith is – resting on the Word of God.
4
The Royal Official gives us a marvelous picture of the Christian life. We walk by faith, not by
sight (2 Cor. 5:7). We rest on the word and promise of Jesus. He says that he is with us, and
that he will never leave us or forsake us (Heb. 13:5). He says that his grace is sufficient (2 Cor.
12:9). He says that there is no condemnation for those who are in him (Rom. 8:1). He says that
he has prepared a place for us (John 14:3). Faith trusts Christ by resting on his word.
The Royal Official had to do this for some time. Notice that when the servants finally reach him
with the wonderful news that the boy is well, the father asks when this happened. The
servants say, “Yesterday at the seventh hour” (4:52). So presumably the Royal Official stayed
overnight in Cana, and then made the journey home the following day.
I wonder how he slept that night? When he left his home, his son was dying. Jesus said, “Your
boy will live.” All he had was the word of Jesus. That’s faith: Faith trusts Christ by resting on his
word.
What a moment it must have been for the Royal Official the following day when his servants
met him on the road with the good news! “As he was going down, his servants met him and
told him that his son was recovering” (4:51). Literally translated, they said, “Your son lives!”
Notice that the father asks them “the hour when he began to get better” (4:52). He assumes
that this was a process. When did it begin? The servants say, “Yesterday at the seventh hour
the fever left him” (4:52). It was instantaneous! When Jesus spoke the word in Cana, the fever
left in Capernaum!
We read, “The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, ‘Your son will live.’
And he himself believed” (4:53). Had he not believed already? Yes, but now his faith is turning
to sight, and he is seeing that his trust in Jesus was not misplaced.
Here is what the journey of faith looks like. Faith often begins when knowing very little, but
being deeply aware of our need, we come to Jesus. Faith grows as we learn to trust him by
resting on his word. One day, faith will be turned to sight. Faith will be vindicated and all that
you have taken on trust will be yours to enjoy forever.
The whole family believed
The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live.” And
he himself believed, and all his household (John 4:53).
The servants believed. The boy who had been at the point of death believed. If there were
other siblings, they believed. The boy’s mother believed. And there’s only one way that all of
these folks could have come to faith in Jesus – through the testimony that the Royal Official
gave to his own family!
5
Imagine the scene when the Royal Official finally gets home. His wife comes running out to
meet him and flings her arms around him. “The most wonderful thing has happened! The
fever has gone! It left him in an instant! I don’t know how in the world it happened!”
“Well,” says the official to his wife, “I know how it happened.” Jesus said to me, ‘Your son will
live,’ and at that very hour the fever left him.” So a story that began with a boy at the point of
death ends with an entire household receiving the gift of eternal life!
The Significance of This Story
This is a marvelous story. But what is its significance for us? I want to give you two
applications, but first I want us to be clear about what the application is not.
1. This story is not about you having enough faith for a miracle
The application is not that if we had enough faith we would all see our loved ones healed. I
have no doubt that God can and does grant miracles today. But miracles are miracles. By
definition, that means they are not what normally happens. Why then are these miraculous
stories here in the Gospels if this is not what normally happens?
2. This story was written so that you may believe
This miracle, John tells us, was a sign: “This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he
had come from Judea to Galilee” (4:54). A sign of what? John tells us why the signs were given:
“These are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by
believing you may have life in his name” (John 20:31).
The whole of John’s Gospel, the signs and everything else, were written so that you would
know that Jesus is the supreme Lord of heaven and earth, that he is God with us, that whatever
he says happens, and that by believing in him you may have life in his name.
3. This story was written so you can learn why grace is better than law
But there’s something else here that I think is very wonderful, and I want you to know where I
learned this. In the summer of last year, I spoke at a conference in Iowa. During that time, I
had breakfast with a pastor by the name of Brian Janssen.
Brian is a graduate of Wheaton College and of Trinity seminary. For more than 30 years he has
served as pastor of a church in rural Iowa. Brian made a study of the seven signs in John’s
Gospel, which he shared with me, and from I which draw from with his permission.
At the beginning of his Gospel, John makes this remarkable statement: “The law was given
through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ” (John 1:17). So we should expect
that in this Gospel, we will learn why grace is better than law and why Jesus is better than
Moses. Brian picked up on this in relation to the seven signs in John’s Gospel.

John tells us about the ‘signs’ Jesus gave. But Moses also performed signs. God said to
Pharaoh: “Let my people go!” Pharaoh hardened his heart and said, “I will not let them go.”
So God said, “I [will] multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt” (Ex. 7:3). These
signs, performed through Moses, were signs of judgment, and we know them as the ten
plagues. The first of these signs was that the river Nile was turned to blood. Moses turned
water into blood. What was the first sign performed by Jesus? He turned water into wine!
When Moses turned water into blood everything in the river died! When Jesus turned water
into wine, everyone was filled with joy! Jesus brought a better sign than Moses. Moses
brought the signs of judgment; Jesus brought the signs of grace.
Now what was the last of Moses’ signs? The tenth plague was the death of the firstborn son.
God had commanded Pharaoh, “Let my people go!” but Pharaoh had refused. Nine plagues
had come and gone and Pharaoh had not moved an inch. Every day the cruelty and oppression
of the slave drivers in the labor camps continued. And God’s people cried out to him to deliver
them from their suffering.
Scripture tells us about “the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on the throne” (Ex. 12:29). This
indicates that Pharaoh’s son was part of the regime, a “little king” in his own right. He would
have been an enforcer of the terrible cruelty and oppression that Pharaoh’s royal house carried
out on God’s people.
You know the story: God told his people to sacrifice a lamb and to paint its blood on the
doorposts of their houses. God said, “When I see the blood, I will pass over you” (Ex. 12:13).
This is such a magnificent statement, pointing forward to how the blood of Christ so
wonderfully delivers us from the judgment of God.
On that night, God brought judgment on his enemies. Think about what that was like for the royal
son, the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne. He knew the commandment of God, “Let my
people go.” He knew that the judgment of God had been announced from heaven. But, like his
father, he had taken no notice. No doubt he would have thought, as many do today, “This is not a
god that my culture believes in.”
So he gets up in the morning, feels great, works out and then goes through his day driving his
slaves, cursing their God, bringing misery and pain to everyone round him. At the end of the
day he comes back to the palace. “A good day, son?” the Pharaoh asks him.
“Yes, I really stuck it to them today.”
“How was your day, Dad?”
“O, Moses was back here again. I’ve never seen him so angry” (Ex. 11:8).
7
“What was he saying this time, Dad?”
“O, nothing you need worry about, son… sleep well.” So the ‘little king’ went to bed. And
at midnight he was gone.
What does this fearful story from the Bible say to us? Surely this: That we live in a world that is
in rebellion against God, that this world is under God’s judgment, and that “the wages of sin is
death” (Rom. 6:23).
The law came by Moses, and if God were to judge us by his law today, none of us would live!
We would all be under the sentence of death: “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of
God” (Rom. 3:23).
The sign of Moses was that a royal son, in the prime of life, dies. The sign of Jesus is that a royal
son, at the point of death, lives!
When you speak to people about your faith in Jesus, people who do not yet believe, they will
assume that you want to talk to them about law. “You have come to tell me what I cannot do.
You have come to tell me that God hates me, and that God is against me, and that he is going to
get me.”
That could not be further from the truth! Here is the message: The God whose laws we have
broken, and whose judgment we deserve, sent his Son into the world not so that we who are in
the prime of life should die, but that we, who are on the brink of death, should live!
That is precisely why Jesus came into the world! “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God
is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord” (Rom. 6:23).
“God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the
world might be saved through him” (John 3:17). The law came through Moses. Something
much better – grace and truth – came through Jesus Christ” (John 1:17). And there is grace
and truth in Jesus Christ for every person here today. ",Colin Smith,"Barrington, IL",2/12/2017,
"We come today to the second part of this marvelous story of a woman whose life was changed
forever by Jesus Christ, and whose witness led to an entire community coming to believe in
Jesus.
I cannot think of a story that brings greater encouragement for us in the work of ministry than
the words that are before us today.
? If you are tired, jaded or discouraged today, wondering whether the effort that you put
into serving the Lord is worth it, these verses will be a tonic to your soul today.
? If you have been wounded while serving the Lord, and now you are holding back from
giving yourself to ministry, these verses hold the most marvelous incentive for you.
? If you find yourself afraid of what might happen if you commit yourself more fully to
following Jesus, these verses are for you.
? If you have a desire to extend yourself more fully in serving the Lord, to discern how you
can make the best use of your life for his glory, these verses are for you.
To summarize the story thus far, Jesus was travelling from Judea (in the south) to Galilee (in the
north) and his journey took him through Samaria.
? Samaria was not a place where you would expect to find people interested in following
Jesus.
? Our Lord was born a Jew, and there was a long history of hatred between the Jews and
the Samaritans.
? The Samaritans had their own religion, and while there were elements of truth in it –this
woman knew that the Messiah would come (4:25) – it was buried under a heap of
idolatry and superstition.
This woman had lived a life that was far from God and far from his commandments. If you
were looking for prospects of people who might become disciples of Jesus, this woman was the
least likely person in the least likely place.
Today, we come to the sequel to this great story. At this point in the story, the disciples had
just come back from the city. They had gone there to buy food (4:8), and that is why Jesus was
alone with this woman at the well.
The disciples returned and were surprised to see Jesus talking with the woman, but none of
them said anything. The woman then went back into the city, where she began to speak to
He Is the Savior

2
others about Jesus: “Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did” (4:29).
While this was happening, John tells us about a remarkable conversation that took place
between Jesus and the disciples that I hope and pray will bring blessing and encouragement to
every believer today.
Give Yourself to God’s Work…
and You Will Have Great Joy
When the disciples left Jesus, he was weary from the journey (4:6). They went into the city to
buy food because all of them were hungry. But when they come back with the food, Jesus
shows no interest in eating.
Picture the disciples now sitting beside the well, eating their lunch. But Jesus is energized. He
is walking around. His mind is clearly somewhere else, and he shows no interest whatsoever in
sitting down for the lunch that they have just bought. The disciples were urging him, saying,
“Rabbi, eat!” (4:31). You sense the frustration they have with him.
The disciples didn’t know what to make of it: “What is this? When we leave him, he is tired and
weary. When we come back less than an hour later, he is energized, animated, fired up,
refreshed, reinvigorated and full of joy! What has happened?”
Then Jesus says to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know about” (4:32).
So the disciples asked one another: “Has anyone brought him something to eat?” (4:33). “Did
someone show up while we were away and give him his lunch already?”
Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to accomplish his
work” (4:34).
Jesus is saying this: If you do what God wants you to do and serve where God wants you to
serve, it will be like food for your soul. Years ago, I heard this phrase from Warren Wiersbe:
“Ministry is nourishing.” Give yourself to the work of God and your own soul will be fed.
This is not the only truth about ministry. If you give yourself to the work of God, you will also
find that there is a cross to carry and there is a cost. These truths belong together.
Think about the birth of a child: There is great pain, but the pain is overwhelmed by great joy.
Doing the will and work of God may bring you great pain, but it will also bring you the greatest
joy.
Jesus was tired, weary, and hungry. He could easily have ignored this woman. He could have
smiled and said something about the hot weather. But he extended himself to reach out to this 
3
woman. He gave himself to win her with faith, hope, and love. And what came from this was
that Jesus himself was refreshed, renewed, energized, and filled with joy!
Many years ago, at a time when I was jaded and quite discouraged, someone sent me a card
with a verse from Proverbs that helped me then and has stayed with me ever since: “Whoever
refreshes others will himself be refreshed” (Prov. 11:25 NIV, 1984).
So here is the principle: If you hold yourself back from ministry to others, your soul will run dry.
But if you extend yourself in ministry to others, you will be blessed and you will experience
great joy.
Give Yourself to God’s Work…
and You Will See Him Move in Ways You Did Not Expect
“Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you,
lift up your eyes, and see that the fields are white for harvest” (John 4:35).
There is a great deal of discussion in the commentaries about “four months until the
harvest.” Is this an indication of the time of year? Probably not. If it was, the weather
would be cool and the fields would be wet. Was it a popular saying? There is no evidence
of this being a common proverb at the time.
I suspect that this was a line that was repeated by the disciples: “Do you not say…” We all
know how this happens. You go on vacation and someone says something, and it catches on
and becomes a running refrain throughout the group. All the people who were there get
what’s being said, though it may not mean much to anyone else.
“There are yet four months, and then the harvest” reflects a mindset that says, “We need to
take things slowly.” It is a cautious mindset: “Don’t expect too much and then you won’t be
disappointed.”
Jesus is saying, “You are always saying, ‘Four more months until the harvest.’ In your mind, the
harvest is always on another day, another place, another time, but I tell you lift up your eyes
and see that the fields are white for harvest” (4:35). What does that mean?
Jesus and the disciples were at the well, and as Jesus was speaking, the people who had heard
the testimony of the woman, “went out of the town and were coming to him (4:30). Looking
across the fields and back towards the town, Jesus saw this large crowd of people coming
toward him. They would be wearing white robes, especially on a hot day.
So Jesus says to the disciples: “Look, here is the harvest coming towards us right now! Lift up
your eyes and see that the fields are white for harvest.”
4
Remember that this spiritual movement is happening in a small town in Samaria, the most
unlikely place for a spiritual movement to take place (you would think).
? Think about a place in the greater Chicago area where you think it would be really tough
to plant a church. You are thinking about Samaria.
? Think about an area in this country that you think is least likely to be responsive to the
gospel. You are thinking about Samaria.
? Think about a country in the world where you think people are least likely to come to
the Lord. You are thinking about Samaria.
? Think about a person you know or have been praying for who seems far from God and
far from any interest in the gospel. You are now thinking about Samaria.
What happens in this story is that the least likely person in the least likely place comes to faith
in Jesus and, as a result, there is a spiritual awakening and a whole community is stirred with
interest in the gospel.
Again, it is not always like this. There were other times when Jesus went into a Samaritan
village and the people did not receive him. They would not even let him in. There is an
example of this in Luke 9:51ff. Give yourself to ministry and there will be disappointments, but
you will also see God at work in ways that you did not expect!
Sometimes the people you think will be most interested in the gospel turn out to have no
interest at all. Often, the people you might think would have no interest in Christ will become
the most devoted and the most fruitful followers of the Savior.
Who would have thought that this woman would be the means of an entire community coming
to faith in Christ? Who would have thought that Saul of Tarsus, who persecuted the church,
would become the spearhead of world mission in his generation?
I want us to receive this as encouragement to go on extending ourselves in ministry today. Give
yourself to the work of God and you will see him move in ways that you did not expect!
We are in the process of extending ourselves in the work of God by launching the Northfield
campus, and church planting in Albania. Many of you are pushing beyond your comfort zone in
giving and in serving because you have a strong desire to do the will and the work of God. As
you give yourself to God’s work, you will see him move in ways you did not expect.
Notice how this community was reached: Someone went across a cultural barrier and shared
the gospel with this woman, and her life is wonderfully changed. Then this woman went back
into her own culture, where she was known by others, and many people come to faith in Jesus
Christ as a result of her testimony.

Give Yourself to Any Part of God’s Work…
and You Will Share in the Reward of the Whole
“Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and gathering fruit for eternal life, so
that sower and reaper may rejoice together” (John 4:36).
Notice especially the words “that sower and reaper may rejoice together.” Normally the work
of sowing and reaping is separated by many months. Sowing naturally happens in the spring
and reaping begins in the fall. Reaping is rewarding – they get all the fun. But sowing is just
hard work – there is no immediate reward for working.
But Jesus says here that the sower and the reaper rejoice together! The point is that on that
day in Samaria, the long interval between sowing and reaping was shortened. Jesus sowed in
the life of the woman at the well, and there was an abundant harvest of a whole community
coming to Jesus, and it has all happened within the space of about an hour!
There is wonderful encouragement for sowers here.
You do not know what God will do in a person’s life after you have sown the seed. Whatever
comes of it, you will share the joy and the reward. The reward is not for reapers only. It is for
those who did the sowing as well!
You will only see a small part of what God will bring from what you have sown in this world –
your life, your testimony, your faithfulness in serving and in giving and in going and in speaking
and in praying. But one day all of it will be revealed. There will come a day when all of the
sowers and all of the reapers will rejoice together with Jesus over all that he has done through
all of his people.
We all have different parts to play in this great work of God in the world. Some sow, others
reap, but the joy and the reward of the harvest belong to both! Give yourself to any part of
God’s work and you will share in the reward of the whole!
There is also encouragement for reapers here.
Notice Jesus says, “For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ I sent you to
reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their
labor” (4:37-38).
I sent you to reap! So stop saying, “Four more months till harvest.” Quit telling yourself that
people in a secularized culture are no longer interested, and that no one will respond. That’s
simply not true! There are always people who are ready to hear the gospel and respond to
Christ. You don’t know who they are and if you tried to guess you would probably be wrong!
6
There are people in your sphere of influence who may be more ready to coming to faith in Jesus
Christ than you might think. The only way you can find out who they are is to tell everyone you
can.
None of us knows what God may have done in the life of another person already. Someone
else may have ‘labored’ in the life of your friend or neighbor. Someone else may have done the
hard work of prayer and of sowing the seed of the Word. They did not see a harvest, but
unknown to you, the seed was planted, and you may have the joy of reaping that for which you
did not labor.
How could you know if that woman in your office has a mother who has been praying for her
every day for the last 10 years? How could you know if your neighbor once had a Christian
friend who made a deep impression on her for good? The joy we have in sharing the gospel is
that you never know what God has done before, and you never know afterward what God will
do as a result of you sowing the seed.
The Principle of Grace
“One sows and another reaps” (John 4:37).
There is a principle of law in the Bible that says, “You reap what you sow.” “Do not be
deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap” (Gal. 6:7). Sow to
the flesh and from the flesh you will reap destruction (Gal. 6:8). If that was all we had in the
Bible, none of us could have hope before God.
But there is also the principle of grace. “Here the saying holds true: ‘One sows and another
reaps.’” Grace means that you can reap what someone else has sown. The heart of the gospel
is that we get to reap what Jesus has sown.
Thank God that the principle of grace is bigger, greater and stronger than the principle of law.
Here is good news for every person today. You do not need to reap what you have sown. You
can reap what Jesus has sown!
Jesus did the great work of living that perfect life, and then of laying it down for you. He
labored and toiled and suffered and died to sow the seed; we get the joy of reaping eternal life
through faith in him. The pain was his; the blessing is ours. We reap that for which we did not
labor (4:38).
Our ministry is to bring in the harvest that Christ has sown. We get the great reward of
gathering fruit for eternal life, so that Christ, the sower, and we, the reapers, may rejoice
together in his promises, with an inexplicable joy forever and ever. ",Colin Smith,"Barrington, IL",2/5/2017,
"I love Easter. I think it's my favorite holiday. I love everything about it. I love the food – the candy –
the chocolate and jelly beans...Charity will attest that I indulged my sweet tooth this week. I love the
time with family, the Easter breakfasts and the family dinners, it's a great time for fellowship. I love the
pomp associated with it when children come all dressed up for church, it's so fun to see everybody
decked out. And I love the fact that it's often marks the beginning of Spring. We celebrated the first
day of Spring this week, of course it was followed by several inches of snow, a typical Minnesota
spring. I love it all, but we make a terrible mistake when we think that Easter is about any of these
things. Easter isn't about new clothes or candy baskets or even warming weather. Easter is about
just one thing - Jesus is risen!
He is risen indeed! We are here today to celebrate that death could not hold Him. We are here today
to rejoice that He's conquered the grave. We gather today because Jesus is risen indeed. Of course,
it's not as easy as that. The resurrection presents real difficulties and real challenges. There's
probably some here that roll their eyes at that claim that a man 2000 years ago really did rise from the
dead. Not after flatlining in a hospital for 2 minutes, but after being buried in a cave for a weekend.
And you know what? I get that. I'm a natural skeptic myself, so if someone comes along, telling me
about an improbable miracle, I'm the first to shake my head in doubt. People rising from the dead?
That just doesn't happen. So people try to dismiss it away. “Maybe everybody hallucinated seeing
him. Or maybe they goofed up and went to the wrong cave. You're a smart guy, pastor, you don't
really believe all that, do you?”
Well, I do. I've researched those other options, and I don't know how else to understand the empty
tomb. I mean, if they went to the wrong cave, all the Pharisees would have to do is point to the right
one, right? Some people say that the disciples stole the body, but these weren't warriors, these were
fisherman and tax collectors. Peter, the bravest of the bunch denied Jesus when a little girl called him
out. And when he did try to attack a soldier, he dealt a terrible blow to the guy's ear. The disciples
weren't brave enough, and they weren't skilled enough. They weren't equipped to defeat the soldiers
guarding the tomb.
And how else can you explain the transformation of the disciples. When Jesus went to trial, they
deserted him like rats in a sinking ship – but after that first Easter, they were willing to go to prison and
even die for being a Christian. Now I've pulled a few pranks in my day, and I was willing to serve
detention when I got caught, but not much more. Of course, some of my classmates were crazier,
they were willing to get suspended for their pranks. But if the disciples really had pulled off robbing
the tomb, why in the world would they die for it? Who dies for a prank?
And it's not just the disciples who had a crazy change of heart. There were unbelievers, too, like
Jesus's own half brother, James. Leading up to the crucifixion, he still doesn't believe that Jesus is the
Messiah. I don't know what he made of the miracles, but he sure wasn't one of Jesus's followers. A
couple weeks later though, there James is. Now he's absolutely a believer, even a leader in the
church. He died for Christianity too.
And when we look at the weight of the historical evidence, the overwhelming conclusion is that Jesus
really did raise from the dead. You can't be skeptical once you've considered all the data. And yet,
people still doubt. Of course, there's another side to this conundrum, those who believe. I'm guessing
this is most of the people here. We believe that Jesus rose from the dead. We believe that God can
work miracles, and in this case, God did work a miracle. But that doesn't mean the resurrection isn't a
danger to us, too. The danger for believers is that we take the resurrection for granted. See, we talk
about it every year at Easter, and many times in between. It's such a pillar of our faith, and the words
roll of our tongue, ""Jesus died and rose again"", and we forget how crazy this notion is - that a man
was raised from the dead. I mean, have you ever been to a funeral where they've lost the body?
Have you ever been to a funeral where the body got up and walked out? That simply doesn't happen.
BUT IT DID....
On Friday night, we had a special service dedicated to helping us realize the significance of Jesus's
death, because when we reflect on the significance, it becomes all that more real to us. If you're like
me, you left Friday night amazed that Jesus would give his life for you. But as significant as Jesus's
death is, it wouldn't mean anything if He didn't come back to life. Paul says as much in the 1st letter to
the Corinthians, he says, ""If Jesus had not been raised, your faith is futile...If Jesus had not been
raised, we're all still stuck in our sins...If Jesus had not been raised, then we have no hope...If Jesus
had not been raised, then we ought to be pitied for chasing an impossible dream"".
See, the Resurrection matters. It is the cornerstone of our faith. It's why philosophers and historians
have spent so much time debunking the skeptics, because if there is no resurrection, then Christianity
is pointless, empty, and stupid. But Jesus did rise from the dead. The honest skeptic needs to
acknowledge it, and we, as believers, cannot take it for granted. So this morning, I want to talk about
why it matters, because the Resurrection of Jesus Christ changes everything, and I want to highlight 3
big implications of the resurrection.
The 1st implication of Jesus raising from the dead, is that we know something happens after death. On
Friday night, we had a special service, where we remembered Jesus dying on the cross, and at the
very end of the service, I said, “Tonight is not the end of the story. There is another chapter after
death.” That is true for us as well as Jesus. The Bible tells us this clearly. It talks about the judgment
day where we will stand trial before God, where we will be confronted with all of our actions, good and
bad. Some will be told to enter into heaven, some will be told to enter into hell, and the difference
between these 2 groups of people isn't whether they're good people or bad people, it isn't how many
people liked them, or how bad their reputation was. The difference is that those who believe in Jesus
and follow Him – they'll go to heaven. Those that reject Jesus, choosing to live their own life instead.
Well, they don't go to heaven, you know where they go.
Now we might be tempted to ask, “What do these human writers of the Bible know about any of this?
They haven't died. How do they know – really know – that there is something beyond the grave?” But
the answer is – because Jesus rose again. Jesus proved that death is not the end. And Paul writes in
1 Thessalonians 4, “Brothers, we do not want you to be ignorant...or to grieve like the rest of men,
who have no hope. We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and so we believe that God will bring
with Jesus those who have fallen asleep in Him...For the Lord himself will come down from
heaven...and the dead in Christ will rise.”
In other words, 'If we follow Jesus'...If we follow Jesus in worshiping God the Father, if we follow Jesus
in loving our neighbor as we love ourselves, if we follow Jesus in living – not for ourselves – but for
God, and if we, like Jesus, are willing to suffer for the sake of others, then when we die, we will follow
Jesus too. We will follow Jesus into the tomb, temporarily. We will follow Jesus by raising up with a
new body at the judgment day. And we will follow Jesus in spending an eternity in heaven with God.
In fact – if we follow Jesus – then death is not the end at all. Death is just when the story starts to get
really good. It's the beginning of our eternal life. Jesus is Risen, indeed!
The 2nd thing – the 2nd implication – of Jesus rising on Easter morning, is that it shows us that God
always has a plan. See, we live in a fallen world, and there's a lot of suffering. Some of it is our own
fault, we screw up and have to pay the consequences. Some of it is other people's fault, it's their sin,
but we end up suffering because of it. And some of our suffering, like illness or random accidents,
they aren't anyone's fault. They are just part of the uncontrollable, chaotic world that we live in. But
no matter who is to blame, one thing is certain, bad things happen in our lives. And when those bad
things happen, we are tempted to hold up our fists to God and say, “How could you allow this to
happen??? What is wrong with you God? Why do you hate me so much” 
That's an understandable emotion. The Psalms are full of anger toward God. “Why...do you let the
innocent suffer?” But when we think of the innocent suffering, our mind should immediately go to
Jesus, because really, what did He do wrong? He healed those who were sick. He fed those who
were hungry. He preached good news to the poor. He restored those who were in hopeless
situations. He taught the truth about God. And for all this good that Jesus did, God let him die in a
painful and gruesome way, spat upon by wicked men until the breath of life left his body. And if God
would do that to His very own Son, what will God let happen to us? Is there no justice with God? But
then – Jesus raised from the dead. And we learn that Jesus died, to bring us forgiveness. We learn
that when Jesus rose, he conquered all powers of evil. We learn that through Jesus's death, all of
humanity were offered freedom and salvation, anyone who wants it – just follow Him. And it gives us
hope, because if God could take this inhumane and unjust act of killing an innocent man on the cross,
and through it He could save the world and give us life everlasting, maybe God can use our suffering
for good, too.
I'm reminded of a time in this church, when 1 lady was diagnosed with breast cancer. She struggled
with God and questioned him, but God brought her through that trial, and over the next year, several
other women were diagnosed. She was able to instill comfort and confidence because she had been
through it herself. And I'm reminded of one of my very best friends, who headed down a wrong path
and found himself addicted to heroin. He was suicidal, and more than once found himself on a rooftop
looking down, but God brought him through it. God brought the right people into his life, and helped
him to conquer his addiction, and now he's a treatment counselor, helping others to overcome their
addictions. And that tells me that no matter what you are suffering today or what God may allow into
your life this week to come, God has a plan. As sure as Jesus rose from the dead and saved the
souls of all who call on His name, so sure is God's promise in Romans 8:28, “God works all things for
the good of those who love Him.” We may not see all of God's plan in the midst of our agony, but God
can bring light out of our darkest moments.
So 1st, we learn that death is not the end. 2Nd
, we learn that God has a plan. The 3rd implication of the
resurrection is that we have God's infinite power on our side.
Here's a little bit of trivia for you. The Bible has 2 parts, the Old Testament and the New Testament.
We could call it “Before Jesus” and “After Jesus”, and in the Old Testament – the “Before Jesus” –
whenever the Bible writer wants to talk about God's power, they always use the same example: that
God divided the Red Sea and delivered Israel from slavery in Egypt. For 1400 years, that was the
single greatest display of God's power, but in the New Testament, that feat is hardly mentioned. It's
hardly mentioned because a more powerful feat was accomplished. In the New Testament, whenever
a Bible author wants to talk about God's power, they never talk about Israel and the Red Sea
anymore, instead they say, “God raised Jesus from the dead”. Because in one fell swoop, God raised
a person from the dead, and in doing so he gave eternal life to the billions of people who would ever
believe in Jesus Christ. What is more powerful than that?
And the power that God used to raise Jesus from the dead, God promises to use that power to help
us. To help us trust Him. To comfort us in our sorrow. To teach us the truth in a world full of lies. To
guide our steps when we don't know what to do. To answer our prayers when we call upon the Lord.
To change us, from the inside out, and to make us into a perfect reflection of Jesus. God's power will
do all that, but only if we let Him.
I was traveling last year, flying out to Connecticut to visit my family. I left out of LaCrosse, and had a
layover in Minneapolis, and while I was walking from one gate to another, I saw this giant crowd
huddled together sitting on the floor or kneeling, all clumped together in the middle of a gate area. I
was surprised, until I saw what was in the middle of the crowd, it was a phone charging station!
You know – smart phones are amazing things, it took me a long time to get one, but I couldn't imagine
going back. In the palm of my hand, I have access to everything I need. I have a phone, a calendar,
and all of my music. I have 3 bibles and about 30 other books. I'm connected to every friend I've had
since grade school, and I have the resources of the whole internet at my fingertips...as long as...as
long as I have a full battery. Because when that battery gets empty, it's nothing more than a really
expensive paperweight. So when you've been on a plane, using your smartphone, and you finally get
to an airport where there's a place to plug in, you gather around that electrical socket in a hurry.
Because what's the point of having so much power if you can't – or don't – access it?
The power of God is the same way. It's available to us all. If you believe in Jesus, you have access to
the same power that created the mountains and makes the Sun to shine, and yet, it's amazing how
many people have access to this power but ignore it, choosing to go through life alone. I'm not talking
about non-Christians here, although it's true for them, I'm talking about people that call themselves
Christians, but they almost never go to God in prayer, or they never open their Bibles, or they rarely go
to church. They don't gather with other Christians, because....
Well, when it was me, it's because I wanted to sleep in. When it was me, it was because I carried a
grudge against someone about something that was long in the past. When it was me, it was because
reading the Bible was boring, and because I didn't enjoy praying as much as I enjoyed video games.
Let me tell you, those wandering years in my life, when I had access to all of God's power, but I didn't
bother to plug myself in, those were the darkest, most difficult years of my life. It wasn't because of
my circumstances...they were fine, but because I tried to do it alone. So what's your excuse? Are you
sure it's a good one?
Friends, in closing, I want to remember why we are here today. We are here because 2000 years ago
a man was sent from God, and the people rejected Him and killed Him. That could have been the end
of the story, but it wasn't. Instead, that man, Jesus, he conquered the grave. He overcame death. He
rose on the 3rd day. The stone was rolled away and the tomb was empty and that changed everything.
Because Jesus is risen, we know that death isn't the final word. Something more is going to come,
and if we are willing to trust Jesus and follow Him, we, too, will rise again. Because Jesus is risen, we
can know that God never leaves his children or forsakes them. Even in those times where we feel
overwhelmed. Even in those times where we can't see the light. Even in those times when we want
to hold up our fists to the heavens, and say, “God, how can you allow such a thing in my life?” Even in
those times, God has a plan, and that plan is better and more amazing than anything we can imagine.
And because Jesus is risen, we have the power of God on our side. Nothing in this world can stand
against us. No powers of evil are stronger than the one who has our back. We can endure anything.
We can accomplish anything. We can overcome anything the world throws at us, because God has all
the power and all that power is ours, so long as we keep God in the center of our lives.
Jesus is Risen – Jesus is risen indeed!
",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",3/27/2016,
"Today is Palm Sunday. You might have guessed that something was up. We have new banners up
here in the front, the children were passing out palm leaves. It's a special day. Palm Sunday marks
the day that Jesus entered triumphantly into Jerusalem. He rode in on a donkey, which might not be
our idea of prestigious, but the crowd saw no problem with it. They waved their palm branches in the
air. They acknowledge that Jesus was the one ""who came in the name of the Lord"", and they shouted
Hosanna! That word comes from the Hebrew words, ""Hosia Na"", which means, please save us. They
recognized that Jesus was from God. They rejoiced that He was the one able to save, and they
believed in their hearts that when Jesus rode into Jerusalem, He would soon reveal himself to be the
Messiah - the anointed one - the true king of Israel. Crown Him with Many Crowns, indeed.
They were right. Jesus was the Messiah. Jesus was able to save, and before a week had passed,
Jesus will have brought salvation to all humankind, but Jesus surprised them, too. They were
expecting a military leader. They were expecting royal clothes and servants. They wanted all these
trappings for their king. So as the week went on, and Jesus didn't turn out to be their kind of king, they
quickly abandoned Him.
Today is Sunday. By Thursday, his own disciples would betray and disown Him. By Friday morning,
the adoring crowd will call for his death. By Friday morning, Christ will be fitted with a crown of thorns.
By Friday afternoon, Jesus will have died. He died for the humanity that killed Him. He died painfully
to bring us hope. He died innocently for the sins of the world. And this very fickle week begins today
– on Palm Sunday.
Now usually, on Palm Sunday, I read the passage of the triumphal entry, and we focus on Jesus's
kingship. We talk about what it means that Jesus is our King, because even if the Jewish people in
Jerusalem didn't get it, we can still live our lives with Jesus in charge. We can bow before his throne
and let Him rule over our hearts and our lives. It's a good message for Palm Sunday, but it's not the
message I'll be preaching today.
As luck would have it, as we continue our way through Luke, we find Jesus's attention turned squarely
on Jerusalem and we see Jesus alluding to his death. In fact, if we didn't know that we still have
several chapters in Luke between this passage and the crucifixion, we could fully believe that Jesus
spoke this just days before He was nailed to the cross. It's a tough passage, but I love this passage,
because Jesus has a very complicated relationship with Jerusalem. The Jews were His people, His
blood, His countrymen, and God's chosen people. They were chosen to receive Him, the Messiah. At
times they loved Him, but when it really mattered, they hated Him, and this passage is Jesus's lament.
This is where Jesus pours out his heart for His people.
This passage is also wonderful, because it gives us insight into what a real king is like. We're in a
political year, here, and I don't normally talk about politics, but I will say this: No person who's running
for president can hold a candle to Jesus. Jesus is a better king than any King or President or leader
we've ever seen, and as Jesus is pouring out his heart to Jerusalem, we get to see what a perfect
King looks like (and what sort of heart we should crave in our own leaders).
It really is a great passage, so let's dig in. Our passage starts with the Pharisees coming to Jesus, but
they didn't come to test Jesus, like they so often do. No, they came to warn Jesus, it would seem.
They approach Jesus and tell him, ""Get out of here. We know that you're coming to Jerusalem, but
turn around and go away. Jerusalem isn't safe for you because the King – Herod – wants to kill you.""
Now to be honest, I don't know if the Pharisees are telling the truth here. I mean, on one hand, they're
religious guys, so they're not supposed to be lying, but we know that the Pharisees weren't exactly
fans of Jesus. In fact, if they had their way, Jesus would have continued to minister out in the
hinterlands. If he had stayed in Galilee, out of the beaten path, He wouldn't have created nearly the
scene. The Pharisees might have even been okay with it. Better yet, maybe he'd take off to the 
desert, hop on a camel, and flee to Egypt. That's what happened the first time last time a guy named
Herod wanted to kill Jesus back when Jesus was a baby and King Herod's grandfather, also named
Herod, gave orders to kill every child to the age of 2, Joseph took Jesus and Mary and they fled to
Egypt for a few years. Maybe the Pharisees were hoping Jesus would go to Egypt. I'm also not sure
because it doesn't sound like Herod. When Jesus finally does come on trial before Herod, Herod
doesn't act like someone who's wanted to kill Jesus for a long time. When Jesus comes before Herod,
Herod wants Jesus to do a miracle. Herod wants to see a famous Jesus 'magic trick'. Herod wants to
be entertained by Jesus, not kill Him. So it's possible that the Pharisees were just making this warning
up and they weren't looking out for Jesus, they just wanted Him to stay out of Jerusalem.
But there is one good reason to think that the Pharisees are telling the truth, and that reason is that
Jesus seems to take this warning at face value. Jesus doesn't call them out for lying. Instead, He
gives them a message to bring to Herod. ""That Fox"" is what Jesus calls Him. Jesus says, ""Go tell
that fox, 'I will drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow, and on the 3rd day I will reach
my goal.” This is a very confusing answer.
It's a little bit cryptic, because it's impossible that Jesus isn't using some figure of speech. See, even
though Jesus is talking about Jerusalem and his ultimate goal, He's more than 3 days away from
accomplishing his goal. But when Jesus says he'll reach his goal on the 3rd day, we know what Jesus
is talking about. His listeners might not have understood it, but we are looking back and we know that
on the 3rd day, Jesus rose again. And just about every time Jesus talks about ""the 3rd day"", He's
talking about the resurrection. But if Jesus is only talking about the resurrection, then the 1st and 2nd
days are days that he's dead and buried, which isn't what he seems to be talking about when he says
""Today and tomorrow, I will drive out demons and heal people."" So what is he talking about here?
Well, I think he has 2 things in mind: His Ministry and His Mission. The ministry of Jesus is what we've
been seeing all along. He's preaching the good news of the kingdom and he's proving his authority by
casting out demons and healing people. And really, these 2 actions are a fairly decent summary of
how Jesus spent his 3 years of ministry doing miracles that announce the kingdom of God. But when
he talks about his goal on the 3rd day, He is talking about the resurrection, because his mission was to
die for our sins and bring new life. He died for our sins on Good Friday, and He brought New Life into
the world when He rose again on the 3rd day. So this cryptic statement is Jesus's way of joining these
2 ideas together. “I'm going to keep doing my ministry until I fulfill my Mission.”
OR.... “I'm going to keep preaching that the Kingdom of God is coming until I reach my goal and
ascend the throne, and be come the King of Kings and Lord of Lords on the day that I raise from the
dead.”
And if we understand it that way, and remember the context – that the Pharisees are warning Him of
death at Herod's hand - then Jesus's response is this:
I don't care if it costs me my life.
In fact, I know it's going to cost me my life.
But I'm going to keep on doing what I've been sent to do
I'm going to keep on healing people physically and spiritually
I'm going to keep on ascending the throne
Regardless of how great the cost is to me personally.
That's the 1st lesson about Jesus as King – he is undeterred by the dangers. Now find me a politician
that is willing to harm themselves to do what's right? I mean, most of our leaders won't harm their
popularity to do what's right. They care more about their own reputation, and they care more about
their own comfort, and they care more about their own prestige, then about doing what is right for the
people. But not Jesus. He was willing to risk it all for His kingdom.
The 2nd lesson about Jesus as king – is that He loves His people, even when they reject Him. He
goes on in verse 34...
34 ""O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to 
you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her
wings, but you were not willing!
First, Jesus calls out to Jerusalem. He acknowledges their history. If we read through the Old
Testament, we are familiar with this history. The first king to rule from Jerusalem was David. The 2nd
king was Solomon. And these 2 kings were...well, decent. They weren't perfect, but they were good.
After these 2 kings, however, it went downhill. Of the 40 or so kings of Israel and Judah, only 3 or 4 of
them were good. Maybe another handful weren't good, but they weren't terrible. But most of the kings
were awful. They led the people in turning from God. They raised up armies to attack the enemies.
They didn't care about the poor. They only cared about increasing their power. And every once in a
while God would send a prophet, and the prophet would go to the king and warn them to change their
ways. When this would happen, more often than not, the king would try to kill the prophet or silence
the prophet.
And it wasn't just the king, it was the people too. The very best prophets were hated by Israel. From
Samuel (who Saul tried to kill) to Elijah (who Jezebel tried to kill) to John the Baptist (who Herod did
kill), prophets weren't welcome in Jerusalem. And neither was God. So Jesus comes on the scene to
Jerusalem where everyone sent from God was attacked or killed, and Jesus says, “I am sent from
God”. What do you think they're going to do to him?
But it's interesting. In all of the Bible, there's only one time Jesus uses a feminine image for himself,
and it's right here, as he talks about prophets and kings. He says he's like a mother hen, because
only a mother's love fits the picture. See, it's not just being rejected. We've all been rejected instead
of loved, whether it's friends or family or some boy or girl we had a crush on, and that rejection hurts
pretty deep, doesn't it? But when a child rejects their mother, when a teenager turns rebellious, that is
a pain on another level because a mother never stops loving her children, no matter how much, or
how badly they hurt her, she is always willing to go back for more.
I'm reminded of a story I read once. It depicted a child who grew up to be a very rebellious teenager,
and one day, this teenage young man went out and got wasted on alcohol. Stumbling home, he
opened the door and passed out in the doorway, and the father was going to wake his son up to kick
him out.
But the mother said, “No.” She got down on the floor and cradled his head in her arms, and she said,
“Don't wake him up. This is the only time I get to hold him.” That's the love of a mother. And that's
the love of Jesus.
Jesus knows that Jerusalem is going to reject Him. Jesus knows that His people are going to reject
Him. But despite the rejection, it doesn't lessen his love. Yes, it hurts him to be rejected, and knowing
what lies in store for Him, it's a very bitter rejection. But as much as it hurts him, His concern is still for
the people. You reject me, and all I want to do is take you under my wing and comfort you. My love
has no limits. My love knows no bounds. I will sacrifice my health and my happiness for you, every
day of the week. No matter how much you spit in my face, and no matter how much you might
torment me, my love will endure over you.
Compare this to the leaders we see on the world stage. When their people protest against them, they
shoot them. When their citizens call for them to step down, they gas them with chemical warfare.
They punish their citizens for their rejection. But not Jesus. He loves them despite their rejection.
And then Jesus ends with a warning: Look, your house is left to you desolate. I tell you, you will not
see me again until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'"" Listen to the truth,
Israel, what you once had (God's favor, God's privilege, God's election), you've forfeited these things
because you've continually rejected God's messengers. 
But maybe there's hope because of when they will see Jesus again. When do they say, ""Blessed is
he who comes in the name of the Lord""? Well, that's what they shout on Palm Sunday, as Jesus is
riding into Jerusalem on a donkey, and they're given one more chance to accept or reject Jesus. And
the choice they make this week will be the choice that determines their eternity.
Friends, what does this message have for us today? We believe that Jesus is our king. We sing
songs that proclaim it, and as Christians, we hold it to be true. And we ought to rejoice that Jesus is a
King unlike any earthly leader, for Jesus will continue to work for His kingdom no matter what it costs
him, and we are the recipients of His diligence. We are blessed because of his ministry. We have
learned the truth that God is in charge. We have God's kingdom dwelling in our hearts.
And we are blessed because of His Mission. Jesus came to seek and save the lost. When we were
lost, Jesus came to seek and to save us. But more than that, Jesus loves his people, even when they
reject Him. That means that when we sin, if we turn to Jesus, he will forgive. That means that when
we are afraid and we deny Him, He loves us still. That means when we think we know best and we
strike out on our own, Jesus still died for us, Jesus still will forgive.
Friends, for those of us who are in Christ, nothing – neither heights nor depths nor angels nor demons.
Nor any power in all of creation – can separate from God's love. Blessed is He who comes in the
name of the Lord. Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",3/20/2016,
"There's a phrase that's been growing in popularity in recent years. I'm sure you've heard people say it
when talking about their belief systems. More and more people are saying that they are ""spiritual, but
not religious"". Have you heard that? Even though it's become more and more popular (and it's
growing – nearly 20% of people under the age of 30 claim this category in recent religion surveys), it's
a really difficult concept to define. Maybe that's actually the point.
On the one hand, people are claiming to be spiritual. They are recognizing that there is more to this
world than what they can see or hear or touch, but they're not necessarily saying what that 'more' is. It
could be that they believe in a higher being. It could be that they recognize that the soul is deeper than
the body. It could be that they believe in aliens or ESP or ghosts. The options are very broad, but the
one thing that is very clear is that they don't adhere to a religion. Whether it's Christianity or Judaism
or Buddhism or Islam, they don't believe that any of these actually has the spiritual world figured out.
They're spiritual, but not religious.
That's the minimum definition, but I think it goes deeper than that. The cynical part of me says that
they prefer a religion of their own making. They can't deny that something is out there, the book of
Romans says as much. It says that everything in creation testifies to our hearts that God exists, and if
we try to deny God, it's like trying to hold a beach ball under water, the truth of the matter just keeps
coming up. So as much as someone might want to deny that there is a God, they can't. But as much as
they have to acknowledge that there is something, they reject all religions. And I think the #1 reason
they reject religions is because religions have lots of rules.
And who can blame them? None of us like having rules. We didn't like rules when we were 3 years
old and our parents told us we couldn't have a cookie. We didn't like rules when we were teenagers and
told that we had to be home at a certain hour. It's not like we wake up one day as adults, and suddenly
we love the rules, suddenly we crave filling out tax forms or driving the speed limit. No, if we do obey
the rules, it's because we've decided that following the rules are less awful than the consequences, but
still, there are plenty of adults who break the rules. So when a preacher or a church comes along and
says, ""Guess what you need? More rules!"", it's not surprising that people don't embrace this idea. And
so they become spiritual, but not religious. They get all the benefits of belief without any of the rules.
Of course, religion isn't just about the rules. As much as we like to say that Christianity isn't a religion,
it is, because we have a uniform set of beliefs. We believe in God. We believe that the Bible is true.
We believe that Jesus died and rose again, and if you don't believe these things, you really can't call
yourself Christian. Christianity is also a religion because we fellowship together. I'm often asked if
you can be a Christian without going to church, and the answer is this: You can believe the same things
Christians believe and maybe even have salvation apart from going to church, but if you're going to be
a practicing Christian, part of that practice is gathering with other Christians. But even though
Christianity is a religion because we have agreed upon beliefs, and even though Christianity is a
religion, because you can't practice it alone, if some ""spiritual, but not religious"" person wants to avoid
Christianity because of the rules, well, frankly, they don't understand what Christianity is about, as we
find in our passage today.
It's Saturday – the Sabbath - and Jesus is teaching in the synagogue. All of a sudden Jesus sees a
woman who was crippled, hunched over, unable to stand. She had been this way for 18 years (which is
a significant detail), and when Jesus sees this woman, He immediately speaks to her, telling her that she
is healed, and commanding her to stand up straight. And she does! God be praised! But the Pharisees
aren't so happy about it.
See, in their mindset, she had been suffering for 18 years, so what would be the problem of waiting one
more day? Why should Jesus heal on the Sabbath? Jesus also recognized that she had been suffering
for 18 years, but to Jesus, that meant that she had already suffered long enough. You can hear it when
he says, ""Satan has kept her bound for 18 long years"". And so in Jesus's mind, there is no reason she
shouldn't be set free on the Sabbath? And at the heart of the discussion between the Pharisees and
Jesus is the question of the Sabbath. And we see healing on the Sabbath time and time again as the
source of conflict between Jesus and the Pharisees. I don't know why Jesus chose this one, but I can
tell you the issues at hand.
The Sabbath is the 7th day of the week, and you remember in creation, God worked 6 days and then
rested on the 7th. And when God handed down the 10 commandments, right near the top of the list,
above not lying, stealing, or murdering, was this instruction, ""Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy"".
Now the Pharisees were sticklers for the law, and they made up all sorts of additional rules to make
sure people didn't accidentally break it. They told the people what they could and could not do on the
Sabbath, even dictating the number of steps you could walk before it became 'work'. It didn't matter
how close you lived to the synagogue, if you lived to far away, you couldn't worship without it being
'work'. But then Jesus comes along and says, ""You're missing the whole point."" The reason that you
don't work on the Sabbath is to make it holy. That doesn't mean you can't do anything. You can water
your livestock. You can rescue your animal who falls into a pit. You can certainly bring healing and
victory to the life of a person, a daughter of Abraham who has been suffering. In fact, healing her
makes the day more holy, not less. And throughout the gospels, this debate is one that gives foundation
to the Pharisees wanting to kill Jesus, so we see each of Jesus's Sabbath healings driving the story
along.
But more important than that, Jesus is using these healings as an opportunity to teach us about God.
And we discover that when God comes in the flesh to teach us about true religion, it's more about
healing a suffering woman than obeying these man-made rules. God cares more about love than about
laws. He values people over policies. He desires relationship more than regulation. He's much more
concerned with mercy than He is about mandates.
So anyone who avoids Christianity because of the rules doesn't understand Christianity. And if we put
all of our energy on following the rules, then we're not actually following Jesus either. Because the
heart of Christianity is restoring people's relationship with God, not merely obedience to a list of rules.
And this truth, that God cares more about love than the law changes everything. And this morning, I'd
like to discuss 4 of the ways it changes Christianity, 4 implications of the fact that God is more about
mercy than mandates.
The 1st implication is that it reverses the role of rules in our lives. See, every religion in the world, save
Christianity, teaches the very same thing: “If you obey the rules, you will get a reward.” Whether it's
Muslims to find their rules in the Koran, and promise that if you obey them you will be in paradise with
70 virgins. Or it's Mormons who if they follow the rules about tithing and not drinking coffee, they'll
end up as the gods of their own planet somewhere in the universe. Or even Buddhists, who promise
that if you don't eat meat and you do meditate regularly, you'll be reincarnated as monk rather than as a
bird.
But in Christianity, the rules play a very different role. Yes, in Jewish times, they were just like every
other religion in following rules, but Paul says in Romans 7 that the purpose of the law wasn't to make
us good people. Rather, it was to make us realize that we were bad. He says that he coveted, was
envious, from his birth, but he didn't know that coveting was sin until he understood the rules. In 
Christianity, the purpose of the law was to make us realize that we needed a savior. So how do we get
our blessings? By joining ourselves to Christ. How do we become good people? By joining ourselves
to Christ. And yes, because the law tells us what makes God happy, we ought to avoid stealing and
lying and murdering. But we aren't saved by obeying the laws. Rather, it's because Jesus made us
good and holy that we even have the option of obeying the rules. Because we've been made good and
holy, we want to please God, and that is why we strive to obey the rules. Do you see the difference? In
every religion in the world, people obey the rules so that they can become good. In Christianity, people
obey the rules because they already are good. It's the exact opposite, which is why many say,
“Christianity isn't a religion – it's a relationship”. Because it's not about the rules.
Which brings us to our 2nd implication, we need to recognize the rules we add on. The truth is – every
church has rules. We have rules that help us to be polite and get along with one another, like if you use
the church kitchen, you need to clean up after yourself, or when the Prelude begins, conversations in
the sanctuary should quiet down. We have rules that are unspoken, like when the doxology starts
playing, you stand up. But those rules, we all realize, are man-made. They may be helpful, but they're
not from God. The danger comes, however, when we start imposing rules about how we ought to
behave, and then we insist that following these rules are indicators of someone's spiritual life. Some
churches, for example, say that men must wear a suit to church or women wear a head covering.
Others, like the Mennonites, say you're not a real Christian if you dance. Some churches insist that all
the real Christians vote a certain way. Sometimes, we even see churches use these rules to define what
they're about.
Now the dirty secret is, by selectively choosing Bible verses and by ignoring the context of those
verses, we can make the Bible say anything we want, just about. So usually these rules have some
Bible passage to back them up, but they don't have to. Many of these rules come out of the church's
culture or the pastor's preference. So even if there is a biblical warrant, it's not biblical to say that
following or breaking these rules makes or breaks your Christianity, and that's where the problem lies.
That was the problem for the Pharisees, who said that nobody could honor God and heal on the
Sabbath, and that's the problem when churches say that you can't be a Christian without following
certain rules. Last I checked, we were saved by Jesus, not saved by rule following.
But it's not just churches that do this. As a church, I don't know that we have a whole lot of these rules,
but I have heard individuals say, ""I don't think that person is a real Christian – if they were, they
wouldn't act that way."" That's a problem. Because while man-made rules can help us get along with
one another, and man-made rules can even help us to encourage spiritual growth, we can never let manmade
rules become what defines us as Christians. We aren't God. We don't get to make the rules.
So these first two points tell us that we can't elevate rules so highly. The 3rd implication tells us how to
get along when rules aren't our number 1 priority. The 3rd implication of putting mercy over mandates
and love over the law is that we need to rely on the Holy Spirit to guide us.
Let me tell you why. Rules are easy to follow. If all we had to do was eat certain foods, dress certain
ways, and abstain from certain behaviors, Christianity would be a walk in the park. But Jesus tells us
that really, there's only 2 rules to follow in Christianity: Love God and Love People. But loving is a
tricky rule to follow.
For example, let's say you're a parent of a teenager and you get a call at 3 in the morning that your child
snuck out, got drunk, and started driving. They got pulled over, and now they're sitting in a holding
cell. In that situation, what is the loving response? Bail them out and let them avoid suffering? Or let 
them suffer the consequences of their action and learn a lesson? Really, either can be the loving
response depending on the situation. Or maybe you have a friend who says, “I don't believe in God.”
Is it more loving to debate with them? Or more loving to pray quietly for them? Or say someone
comes to you with gossip about one of your friends. Do you tell them that there's gossip about them?
Or do you keep it quiet since you know there's no truth anyway? Which is more loving?
And for all these examples, and a million more that we encounter each week, the loving choice isn't
always an obvious choice. We know we're supposed to love, but which action is the loving one? We
need the Holy Spirit to guide us. There are no rules for many of these situations, but the Holy Spirit
will always point us to truth.
Now with all this, we might prefer a world of rules. We might prefer a straightforward 'religion',
because following rules is easier than trusting the Holy Spirit, and because man-made rules are
comforting in giving us boundaries. And because if we were saved by the rules, then we could pat
ourselves on the back for being so wonderful and holy and spiritual. But there's a 4th result of Jesus
triumphing over the rules, and that is that we should rejoice.
If you look at the crowd, they rejoiced when they heard Jesus's teaching. They were happy to discover
that Jesus is more about the heart than the rule-book, because they knew the same thing that we all
know deep down - and that's the fact that we've broken God's rules.
Raise your hand if you've never lied once in your life.
Raise your hand if you've never over-indulged on drink, or food, or TV.
Raise your hand if you've never taken God's name in vain, or shared a vulgar joke.
Raise your hand if you've never looked down on someone because they think or act differently than
you do.
Are there any hands raised? I know my hand isn't going up because I've broken all those rules and
more, and I don't need someone to come along and give me more rules that I can't manage to follow.
What I need is someone to forgive me even though I have broken the rules. And what the crowd
needed in our story was someone to show mercy even though they did break the rules. Someone who
would love them despite their sins, and someone who could heal their souls the way Jesus healed this
woman's body. And you know what? We have that person. Jesus loves us in our sin and Jesus forgives
us in our trespass, and if we follow Him, He'll heal us in our weakness.
Friends, this means we ought to rejoice. We ought to be the very happiest of people, knowing we've
been given something we can't earn for ourselves. We ought to celebrate every day and every week
because we've been given a gift that we definitely don't deserve. The Pharisees, they had the chance at
that same gift and they rejected it because accepting the gift meant that they couldn't look down on
others. But they're not the only ones who look down on others. We in the church are notorious for that,
and that's why so many people say that they're spiritual, but definitely not religious.
Friends, we don't want to be religious. We don't want to turn people away because they don't live up to
our standards, and we certainly don't want to reject Jesus because He offends our sensibilities. We can't
let ourselves fall into the trap of the Pharisees because that trap leads us to sin. Instead, let us
understand the role that rules have in our faith. They don't save us. They don't help us. But we live the
best we can because we love God and want to please Him.
Let us recognize that while our rules might be helpful for getting along, they're just that – our rules.
They're our rules and they're human rules, and even the best of our rules don't matter one bit when it
comes to people getting saved.
Let us realize that without rules, we really don't know what we're doing, so we need to rely on the Holy
Spirit to guide us, to tell us what to say and how to act. And our goal should be to learn to hear Him, to
trust Him, and to obey Him.
And finally, let us rejoice, because Jesus loved us when we were rule-breakers. God cares more about
people than policies, and we are the ones who benefit from Christ's love. Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",2/28/2016,
"I want to start with a question this morning. What do you do, when you're reading your Bible, and you
come across a difficult passage? I ask this today, because we've come across one of those famously
difficult passages. It contains an illustration that isn't terribly obvious how it connects - what a man
going to court has to do with wind blowing from the south, it's a little tricky. Although that's not what
makes it difficult. Perhaps it's imagery that isn't contextually explained, and that can be taken more
than one way: Jesus coming to bring fire. But the image of fire is used to mean God, cleansing,
judgment, or destruction. Which one does it mean here? Jesus doesn't tell us. But that's not what
makes this so hard, either. No, what makes this passage so hard is that it seems to fly directly in the
face of what we already know about Jesus. ""Do you think that I came to bring peace on earth?""
Well, yeah, Jesus, that's exactly what I think. Every Christmas, we have a whole week dedicated to
the peace you bring. The angels appeared to the shepherds saying, Peace on Earth. We have songs
and banners and signs and greeting cards, all declaring that you came to bring Peace on Earth. Do I
think you came to bring peace on Earth? Yeah, Jesus, I do.
But then Jesus says that he didn't come to bring Peace on Earth, and we have to believe Jesus, don't
we? So how do we reconcile these 2 different ideas? That is what makes this such a difficult
passage, because 90 percent of the time it seems like Jesus and the gospels are about 1 thing, and
the other 10 percent Jesus throws us a curve ball. So I gotta ask, when you're reading your Bible,
what do you do when you come across a difficult passage?
I think most people do what I typically do. We're reading our daily Bible reading, and we come across
something that doesn't make sense, and we shrug our shoulders and say, ""Oh well, I can't understand
it all. Maybe I'll go back to it, but probably I won't.” And we close our Bibles and go on with our day.
Of course the problem with that, with ignoring the difficult 10%, is that we construct this idea of Jesus
that's close but isn't quite exactly how Jesus presented himself. Jesus is love and joy and peace, but
if we skip over any other challenging verses, we develop this caracature of Jesus in our heads -
similar, but not quite right. I mean, it's better than the alternative that I've seen some do, which is to
focus so hard on the one difficult passage, to pay so much attention to that 10% that they forget all
about the 90%, and the result is a picture of Jesus that really doesn't bear any resemblance to how
Jesus really is.
That's definitely not a good way to go. But still, if we want to understand who Jesus really is, if we
don't want to develop a distorted picture of Jesus, then we have to be willing to wrestle with these
difficult passages.
Fortunately for all of you, when your pastor is preaching through a book, he can't skip passages just
because they're difficult. So did Jesus come to bring peace on earth? The answer is yes. And no.
Yes, He will bring peace eventually, once he comes a 2nd time when He returns to earth bringing the
Kingdom of God. But that's also once everyone who is unwilling to obey Jesus is sent somewhere
other than heaven. Then, and not until then, will there be peace on earth. In the meantime, however,
Jesus says he's going to bring something very different than peace. And if we are going to take Jesus
at his word, we need to understand, then, what Jesus is saying.
So the first things that Jesus says he is going to bring is fire, verse 49: “I have come to bring fire on
the earth, and how I wish it were already kindled! 50 But I have a baptism to undergo, and how
distressed I am until it is completed!” Now there are a lot of suggestions about what this might mean.
Some say it's a controlled fire – the light of the world. Others say it's a refining fire – the challenges
we face as Christians, persecution, even. But when we look how the Bible usually talks about fire.
When we look at how Jesus talks about fire elsewhere in the gospel of Luke (elsewhere in all the
gospels, really), fire almost always means one thing - Judgment.
Even when we look back to the baptism of Jesus under John the Baptist, John said that Jesus will
bring a baptism of the Holy Spirit and of Fire. John is saying that Jesus will give us 2 choices.
If you follow Jesus – you will baptized, washed in, the Holy Spirit. But if you reject Jesus – you will be 
cast into the fire. It's an either/or.
And only when we understand Jesus to be talking about judgment does the rest of this sentence
makes sense. When does the judgment come? We've been talking about the return of Christ (that
was the topic of last week's passage), and that day goes by 2 names - The Day of the Lord and
Judgment Day. So it makes perfect sense that judgment day is the day that this ""fire"" that Jesus
brings actually arrives.
But a fire that terrible doesn't appear overnight. In the same way that these Forest Fires out west start
as a small spark, but grows as it encounters all the dry woodland, so too the fire of judgment starts
small - it is sparked – kindled, long before it destroys anyone. And if we recognize that the fire of
judgment comes when Jesus returns, then the spark that starts it all comes when Jesus is crucified
and brought back to life. Because the crucifixion is the moment that we can be forgiven. The
resurrection is the moment when we can first receive new life. But forgiveness and new life are only
available if we accept Christ.
If we don't accept Christ, if we reject Him, then we are setting ourselves up for judgment. You can't
reject Jesus until he offers something, and Jesus didn't offer forgiveness or new life until he died and
rose again. Until that fateful weekend, there wasn't any offer to reject, but after that weekend, anyone
who rejects Jesus is asking for fiery judgment whether they realize it or not.
So when Jesus says that he wishes the fire was kindled, and when Jesus talks about a baptism that
He has to undergo, He's talking about the cross. The cross is what makes the Holy Spirit available to
those who believe, and the cross is what condemns those who reject him to fiery judgment. And if the
fire was already kindled, He wouldn't have to go to the cross. Can you blame him for wishing that?
So the first thing that this passage tells us is that there is a fire of judgment to all who reject him.
But the prize that he offers here to those who accept Him doesn't sound a whole lot better. Our
passage continues... “51Do you think I came to bring peace on earth? No, I tell you, but division. 52
From now on there will be five in one family divided against each other, three against two and two
against three. 53 They will be divided, father against son and son against father, mother against
daughter and daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law
against mother-in-law.""
Now some of us are extroverts. We thrive off of interacting with other people. We're social butterflies
and we hate having to be alone. Others of us are introverts. We like our quiet and our space. We still
like people, but in measured doses. But whether we are introverts or extroverts, there is one
relationship that we all universally love, and that's family. And if we do have problems with family, it's
never about something small, because most of the time blood is thicker than water.
So it's telling that Jesus says that following Him creates division, not among acquaintances, nor
among friends, but among family: father and son, mother and daughter. Why is this?
Well, pretty much everything about us divides us with someone else. If you're a Vikings fan, you're not
crazy about Packer's fans, and vice versa. But at the end of the day, we know that sports only matters
so much. It's the same with music. If you love Brad Paisley, you're not going to enjoy going out with
people who only like rap, but again, music only matters so much. Of course there are other things,
that we see as more important. They're closer to our heart – and they divide more. Maybe it's politics,
or race, or economic standing. These things tend to shape our mentality more than we realize. It's not
that we refuse to associate with someone who's political opposite us, or someone who comes from a
different economic stratosphere, or even a different race. Yet, I would suspect that most of us talk
politics with people who agree with us, and we tend to hang out with people who are most like us. In
fact, studies show that for an average person, over 90% of their Facebook friends are the same race
as them. It's not by design, it just happens, but it does happen. So small things – like music or sports 
teams – might affect who we acquaint ourselves with. Bigger things – like economics, race, or politics
– might affect who we become close friends with. But what is big enough to divide us from our family?
Following Jesus is.
Because when we become Christians, it is supposed to affect every last detail of our lives. I'm
reminded of when Charity and Raymond's Dad became a Christian. He grew up in a Catholic house
that was pretty nominal, but he went to a Baptist youth group, and that's where he first heard the
gospel of salvation. And when He accepted the gospel, when he began following Jesus Christ, he
talked about it and wanted to share it with his family. He had good intentions, but he said some hurtful
things along the way. He wanted to see his mother and siblings know Jesus too, but they were happy
where they were, and the truth is, it divided him from his family. It didn't divide forever, the family gets
along great – now - but for a time...son against brother, mother against son. Jesus can do that to us,
because if we really are following Him, our whole view of the world changes. In fact, if following Jesus
hasn't caused any division in your life, that's probably a sign that you haven't let Jesus in as much as
He wants you to.
Of course, this division doesn't have to be contemptuous or bitter. In fact, as Christians, we are
commanded to try to bridge those gaps. We can't deny that following Jesus creates a gap between us
and those who follow the world, but we are supposed to love across that chasm. Jesus tells us to
honor our parents, despite any differences. Jesus tells us to forgive those who stand against us. So
even though Jesus divides, it doesn't have to be permanent. It doesn't have to break relationships,
and yet, Jesus does divide us from those who don't believe.
I think it's a spiritual thing. I don't know how else to explain it. See, Jesus tells us that if you're not
with Him, if you're not controlled by the Holy Spirit, then whether you realize it or not, it's the devil who
controls your heart. How else to explain that your average atheist can embrace Judaism, Buddhism,
and Islam, but when they encounter Christians, anger comes out. Why else would it be that when a
madman in South Carolina wanted to shoot some people because of their race, he walked into a
church Bible study, or that when a madman in Oregon wanted to shoot up his college, he asked
people whether they were Christians or not. Even if we, as Christians, aren't forcing the division,
Jesus still causes division in this world, because those who aren't with Him are against Him. And
Jesus is warning those who would become believers, if you follow me, the world will hate you. You
will be persecuted. You will be divided from them – even divided from your family. But the truth is,
even though being divided, cut off, or pulled away from friends and family isn't a desirable choice, it's
better than the alternative – fire, judgment from God.
That's the choices we have once Jesus dies on that cross. We can reject him, and face the fiery
judgment. Or we can accept him, and face rejection in this world. But there isn't a middle ground.
And this is where our sermon stops being geared towards believers. The focus of the rest is clearly on
unbelievers. Jesus has laid out the choices, and now he's telling everyone who is listening that they
must choose, and he does so with 2 illustrations. The first illustration is of a man watching the
weather.
We still do this, don't we. We watch the weather, because especially in a farming community, the
weather really matters to us. And so there are certain signs we look for: a mild winter bringing a warm
summer, extreme cold keeping the snow away, clouds moving in means that the rain is coming. And
Jesus chastised the crowd for knowing these signs - that a cloud from the west means rain or a wind
from the south means hot and humid. They looked for them, recognized them, and acted according to
them, because the weather mattered to them. But here God is, doing something very big before their
very eyes, and they weren't looking, or recognizing, or caring that the Messiah had appeared on the
scene. They were the first – but not the last – generation who would have to make a choice about
Jesus. Jesus is saying, ""Now is the time to make your choice.""
The next illustration is of a man who has an adversary, someone he is about to enter into legal battle
with, and Jesus calls on good worldly wisdom, which says, avoid litigation if at all possible. Reconcile,
if you can, and do it before you're in front of the judge, because if the judge rules against you, there's
nothing you can do after that except rot away in jail. Of course, the adversary that Jesus is talking
about here is God. He started by talking about the judgment to come and He finishes in the same
place.
So what He's saying is this: get right with God before the judgment day, because if you wait until the
judgment day, then you're stuck with however God rules. So the 1st illustration, Jesus is saying, ""Now
is the time to make a decision."" And the 2nd illustration, Jesus says, ""Well...What are you waiting for?
Hurry up."" Because we never know when Jesus is going to come back.
Friends, we usually don't like to talk about Jesus as someone who is going to bring judgment and fire,
or as someone who is going to divide us from our families. These aren't fun images, and we prefer to
think of how Jesus brings love, joy, and peace. But we can't ignore the truth. Yes, Jesus brings love,
joy, and peace for those who have followed Him. But along with these, Jesus brings division. We
should not be surprised if following Jesus makes unpopular in this world. We shouldn't even be
surprised that following Jesus can drive a wedge between us and anyone – acquaintances, friends,
family – who doesn't believe. Jesus wants us to know that the cost of following Him is being rejected
in this world.
But the cost of rejecting Jesus is far greater. For our friends or family to don't accept Jesus, Jesus
tells us that the cost they pay is fire. They will be judged and punished with the worst punishment
possible. And so we have an urgency, as good, loving Christians, to tell them about Jesus, to beg
them and implore them to accept, lest they face this punishment. Now is the time to make a decision.
What are you waiting for? We can't stand by and let them make that decision. We need to warn
them, just as Jesus warned the crowd. Because if they wait until Jesus comes back, it's too late. If
they wait until the 11th hour, they might die at 10:30.
It's a heart-breaking passage on one hand, because it reminds us that people we care about might
suffer terrible consequences. But it's a wonderful reminder, too, because we're not better than them.
We're not holier than them. We're just fortunate to recognize Jesus's sacrifice, to experience Christ's
body broken, to experience Christ's blood shed. Otherwise, that same punishment would be on us.
Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",2/7/2016,
"“Come, Lord Jesus, Come.” I always loved that line. It's from the end of the book of Revelation. John
the Apostle is excited about Jesus coming back, which is actually a little surprising, because he saw
firsthand all the mess and muck of the book of Revelation. He saw everything that would have to take
place before Jesus would return, all the things that humanity would have to endure in order for Jesus
to once again appear on the scene, and yet, to John, there is no question that it's worth it. “Come,
Lord Jesus, Come.”
It's interesting, some people really do look forward to Jesus coming back. They can't wait! Others,
not so much. Though I can't say with 100% certainty, I think I've figured out the difference. It's all
about age. If you're young, and you still have your whole life ahead of you. So when the pastor says,
“Jesus might return this week!”, you're a little disappointed. Why does Jesus have to come back
before I get married? Why does Jesus have to come back before I graduate?
But if you're older, all of a sudden the return of Jesus doesn't look so bad. You mean those last few
years of my life where I'm old and weak? Jesus wants to take those away? No problem. Those last
few years where my mind goes downhill and I'm a shell of the person I once was? Jesus wants to
take those away? Sounds fine to me. And if you're older, and you hear that Jesus may come back
this week, you have a much different response. “That's great, Jesus! Could you get here before my
doctor's appointment on Friday?”
But can I be honest with you? That is a horrible reason for taking a theological position. Because
whether it's, “I don't want Jesus to return because I'm too excited about the things of this world?”, or “I
can't wait for Jesus to return because I'm so weary of the worries of this world.”, either way, it's your
experience here in the world that is ruling over your hearts and minds and causing you to react the
way you do.
Now that's not to say that mixed emotions about the return of Christ are wrong. In fact, our text today
says some should be really happy, and others should be really sad, but the difference between these
two groups isn't age, it's readiness.
But before we get into today's passage, I just want to take a few moments to remind you what's been
going on in the gospel of Luke. We're in the middle of the largest section of Luke, the road to
Jerusalem. It began in chapter 9, and will continue all the way until chapter 19. And in this chapter,
chapter 12, many of Jesus's teachings have been focused on fear. We started with fear of other
people's opinions, which would lead to hypocrisy. Then there was fear of death, and why we shouldn't
be all that afraid of death if we know God. There was fear of sharing the gospel, because it's a scary
thing to speak up about religion, even if we know it's what we ought to do. And last week, we
discussed the fear of not having enough money, which leads to turning our backs on God.
Now when I began this chapter, I said that one of the most important things about fear is that it
motivates us. So if we're afraid of other people's opinions, we will live to please man, not God. If we
are afraid of death, we will deny God to save our life, if necessary. If we are afraid of sharing the
gospel, we will remain silent even though it's what we are designed to do. If we are afraid of running
out of money, we will work toward and invest in worldly things, not eternal things. And the counter to
all of these very earthly fears, Jesus said, is a fear of God. Because the fear of the Lord is the
beginning of wisdom. Respect of the Lord motivates us to be righteous. And this is all the more true
when we realize that Jesus is coming back someday, bringing with him a day of judgment.
Now the disciples didn't really understand what Jesus was talking about here. This idea of Jesus
returning, requires so much knowledge that the disciples didn't have. After all, the disciples were so
shocked when Jesus said that He had to die, they went into denial about it, because they understood
that the Messiah would never die. The disciples were surprised, too, by the resurrection. When they
first heard about it, they thought the women who told them were crazy, and none of them really 
believed it was true until Jesus appeared before their eyes. Then, when Jesus said that he was going
away and he ascended into heaven, they were dumbfounded and confused, until some angels told
them how to move on. But after that all happened, by the time Luke wrote this gospel, they knew that
Jesus had gone away, and they all believed – rightly – that Jesus was going to come back.
Jesus is coming back! Christians throughout the ages have affirmed this fact. Now some churches
spend all their time (too much time, really) debating when Jesus is going to return or debating the
order that everything is going to happen. They spend so much time debating these things that they
never accomplish any of God's tasks for them here on earth. Of course, the other danger is that we
never think about it. Some churches never talk about Jesus's return, and when a church forgets about
Jesus coming back, it's not long before the church finds itself caught up entirely in this world. Well, the
truth is, Jesus is going to come back. We don't know how, exactly, though we're given some clues.
We don't know when, either - those clues are particularly difficult to decipher. But there is one thing
that is very clear about the return of Christ, and that is: WE ARE TO BE READY.
So what does it mean to be ready? Our passage begins with Jesus comparing his followers to
servants: 35 ""Be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning, 36 like men waiting for their
master to return from a wedding banquet, so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately
open the door for him.
Now in this picture, Jesus is the Lord, the master who is gone off to a feast. He left the home without
any specific time of return, but he expects that his servants will be there waiting. We, I shouldn't need
to tell you, are the servants. We are servants of God and servants of Christ. In the Bible, to be called
a “Servant of God” was the highest title that could be given to a human, so it's not a disparaging thing.
Rather, it is our reality. We are here to serve someone greater than ourselves. We are here on earth
to serve the Lord. And when the Lord returns from his journey, if his servants are ready to spring into
action, He will be pleased.
So the first thing about being ready, is that we need to serve faithfully. As Christians, we've been
given many tasks. We're supposed to love God and love our neighbor. We're supposed to preach the
good news of the kingdom. We're supposed to honor God with all that we do and say. We're
supposed to make disciples of all nations. And when we consider these other fears, and compare it to
serving God faithfully, it means that instead of fearing man and trying to curry favor with other people,
we should live a life of obedience to God, seeking to curry His favor. Instead of trying to find safety
and security in the money we possess, we are to be trusting in God for our safety and security.
Instead of keeping quiet about our faith, because we don't want to offend others, we need to tell the
good news to all who will listen. We do all this because God wants us to focus on our relationship with
Him first and let all our worldly concerns fall into line after that. Let us be faithful servants.
The 2nd thing it means to be ready, is that we are watching expectantly. In verse 38, Jesus says, 38 It
will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready, even if he comes in the second or
third watch of the night.
Now the people who are on the 1st watch are the ones who watched the master leave. We would, and
should, expect that they will be on their best behavior for his return. But if you're on the 2nd watch, that
means that you never saw the master leave. You never heard him give you instructions with your own
mouth. You've only been given orders passed down from those on the 1st watch. Friends, this
describes us. All of us were raised in the world where Christ has been absent our entire life. We've
heard that he's coming back, but we have to take that entirely on faith. It would be completely
understandable for us to question or even doubt his return. We might even be the ones on the 3rd
watch, seeing the light descend into darkness. I suspect that when we look around us and we
consider that church attendance is steadily dropping. When we consider that less and less Americans
consider themselves Christians, and we see terror and violence taking over our streets, we might very 
well say, “The Lord has forgotten about us.” “He's decided not to leave heaven after all.” “And if he
does come back, it certainly won't be now, will it?” But here's the thing. Jesus can return at any time.
It might be this week. It might be this afternoon. Jesus says in verse 39 that He will return like a thief
in the night, that He will come back when we don't expect him, but if we're ready, that means we're
watching expectantly, even when nobody else thinks he'll come back.
And if we are serving faithfully, and if we're watching expectantly, then Jesus tells us it will be good
when He returns. In fact, it's better than we can imagine. He says in verse 37, 37 It will be good for
those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes. I tell you the truth, he will dress
himself to serve, will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them.
I shouldn't need to tell you that this is a very unexpected turn of events that the master would be so
pleased with his servants that he would let them recline at the table while the master became the
servant. In fact, it would be completely unrealistic if we didn't know who our master was. But we
serve Jesus, who got down on his knees to wash his disciples feet. We serve Jesus, who said that he
came to serve, not to be served. We serve Jesus, who came to earth with the express purpose of
dying for a fallen and sinful humanity, and even today, He resides in heaven where He advocates on
our behalf to the Father. The truth is Jesus does serve his servants, but only if we're ready for his
return, he says.
So the first part of this passage tells us that we need to be ready. We need to be faithful. We need to
be expectant. And if we are, the results will be good. But what if we're not ready? Jesus tells us that
if we aren't ready, if we're not faithful, there is punishment. This shouldn't surprise us, really. Just like
there is a great blessing for faithfully serving in the master's absence, there is punishment when we
fail to live up to our calling. So Jesus launches into an explanation that basically goes like this:
If you are a servant who doesn't serve, but you didn't know what you were supposed to do, you will be
beaten lightly. If you are a servant who isn't, but you do know what you are supposed to do, you will
be heavily beaten. And if you are a head servant, someone in change of instructing the others, and
you aren't serving, and you aren't teaching, and, in fact, you're using your position to build your
kingdom rather than God's, then your feet will be cut off and you'll be cast out with the unbelievers.
And that's because, if that's you, you might look like one of God's servants, but you sure aren't acting
like one.
Now before you say, ""Thank goodness I'm not a pastor and that's not an option for me."", I want to say
this...it's not only the pastors who have been tasked with instructing God's children. If you're a council
member, elected to lead the church. If you're a Sunday School teacher, tasked with instructing the
church's children. If you're a parent who has stood on this stage and made a promise before God to
raise your child right when they were baptized, then guess which category you belong in. You are a
head servant, and your punishment for disobedience will be fierce.
In fact, on the face, it might appear like we'd want to be ignorant of our task, but that's not the case at
all. Those who didn't know what to do were still beaten, but they never had a chance to do right. If we
know what we're supposed to do, then the punishment, Jesus says, is harsher, but the possibility of
obeying is so much greater. And everyone here this morning, you know what is right. You know what
you should be doing. None of us are without excuse. In fact, my goal as a pastor is to remind you to
be ready, and to make sure that you are entirely without excuse. But really, the point of this passage
isn't how great it is to be ignorant. The point of this passage is how great it is to be ready and
righteous.
See, we're accustomed to thinking that Christianity is all about us. God loves us. Jesus died for us.
God blesses us. And all that is true. But if we really understand Christianity, we have to confess that
God is in charge. He gets the glory. Our job is that of a servant.
So friends, let us be good and faithful servants. Jesus knew that it was easy for the disciples to follow
Him when the crowds were plentiful and the miracles were constant. But Jesus also knew how hard it
would be to be faithful once He left, and Jesus has been gone for 2000 years. Today, it's easy for us
to say, ""You know what? Today, I'm going to live for me."" But we're commanded to be ready, no
matter how hard it may be to always be ready, especially when we see others living their lives with
seemingly no consequences. We might just be tempted to join them.
But Jesus tells us that there are consequences if we're not ready. You can't live in the king's house,
and eat the king's food, claim Christianity as your own and expect all it's blessings, but spend your life
serving yourself. Instead, we must learn to see our whole life as a chance to serve God. And when
we learn to see going to church, reading the Bible, loving our neighbors and teaching our children,
when we recognize that these are the tasks God wants us to do most importantly. And if we do them,
faithfully, even though we don't know when He'll return, the God will bless you. And God will reward
you. And no matter when Jesus returns, you can be sure that you'll be happy, not scared, to see Him.
Come, Lord Jesus, Come. Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",1/31/2016,
"I wish I had preached on this passage last week, right before we unveiled our annual budget!
I'm joking, of course. The truth is, this church is in a good place financially. We're paying our bills and
operating in the black, and this passage is about much more than simply tithing. I heard a story a while
back about a minister right here at Zion church. He came up and he preached about money one
Sunday, and they he said, ""I've preached on the topic of money, I won't preach it again"" and he burnt
his sermon right up here on the altar. Well, I've preached about money before, and I'm sure I'll preach
about money again, and with good reason: The Bible talks about money a lot. Jesus talks about money
a lot. So if I'm going to preach Jesus and preach the Bible, it's only right to preach about money from
time to time.
Now why does Jesus talk about money so often? 1 in 7 verses in the gospel of Luke references money
in some way, and 11 of his 39 parables talk about money. The reason, I believe, is that money plays a
very large role in our lives. We think about how we can get money. We think about how we will spend
money. Marriage counselors tell us couples fight about money more than any other subject, and many
of the best selling books are on how to have more money and do more with the money you have. Of
course I shouldn't have to convince you that money can take over our thinking. We just watched the
nation go into a frenzy over a Powerball jackpot with countless millions in our country imagining what
they would do if they woke up a billionaire. Money has a way of dominating our thoughts. And when
money dominates our thoughts, it dominates our actions as well.
So when a man came up to Jesus, asking him to settle a dispute, ""Teacher, tell my brother to divide his
inheritance with me"", it was the perfect opportunity to start teaching about money. Now we all know
that inheritances are tricky things. I've seen friendships broken and families torn apart over inheritance
money and I suspect you have too. But Jesus wasn't actually concerned about the inheritance. In fact,
Jesus didn't tell the brother to do anything with the inheritance. His response was evasive, “Who made
me the judge between you too?” He wants no part of this fight because in his view – both of these men
are wrong. They're both valuing money too highly, and that is what Jesus wants to talk about. So he
launches into a great speech with 2 illustrations and a bunch of commands. So let's get going, shall
we?
The first illustration is of an old farmer. He's built up his wealth over the years, and now he has had the
best harvest of his life. In fact, the crop was so good, that he didn't have enough room to store this
massive harvest. So this farmer thinks to himself, “I know what I'll do. I'm going to build a large silo –
big enough to store it all. Then I can be well cared for, then I can finally retire, then I can finally relax.
I'll eat, drink and be merry, and enjoy the fruits of my labor.”
Now at this point, this farmer's plan seems perfectly reasonable. After all, he's not planning on just
celebrating with some giant party. He's not going out and wasting it away. In fact, from the standpoint
of the world, this man has it all together. He's worked hard. He's invested his wealth. He's planned for
his retirement, and now he's going to move forward according to this plan. If you talk to any banker,
this is exactly how you should move forward. We could even look at this farmer and call his actions
wise. But God has a different assessment of this man. God calls him a fool, because there was one
thing missing from his plan. The farmer didn't realize he would die that night. See, this farmer had
worked diligently to amass his fortune, and he did it with an eye toward the future. The problem was,
he wasn't looking far enough in the future. He had worked for a retirement, but God wants us to work
for an eternity. So when this farmer worked hard, looking forward to his time of rest, he was motivated
by the comfort that his wealth would bring. And he was motivated by the security that his wealth
would bring. But for all the comfort and security we think wealth might bring us, there is one thing 
wealth can never protect us from: the end of our lives. God wants us to find our comfort and security
not in earthly things, and not in earthly possessions, but in Him. God wants us to look to the future, not
to our retirement, but to an eternity. To do otherwise is foolish, because being rich in this world is
meaningless if we aren't ""rich toward God"".
Jesus then goes on to appeal to the crowd on the other side of the aisle, to those who are worried about
not having enough money. Most of us are familiar with this statement: Don't worry about your life,
what you will eat, or what you will wear. Look at the ravens, they don't sow or reap; they don't have
storehouses or barns, but God always feeds them. Or look at the lilies in the field, they don't labor or
spin, yet God always clothes them. Aren't you more valuable than a raven or a lily? Why do you
bother worrying?
Now I don't know about you, but I think you have to be pretty poor to be envying a bird eating seed.
This is poverty at the other end of the spectrum. Still, I suspect we can all relate a little. After all, who
of us hasn't worried about money at one time or another. Maybe it's worrying that we'll have enough to
eat, or perhaps it's worrying that you'll have enough to pay your bills at the end of the month. Perhaps
it's a fear that a crisis will come, and you'll be ill-equipped to handle it, or maybe it's a worry that,
unlike the farmer, you won't have enough to retire on. We don't have to be impoverished to worry, but
no matter how impoverished we are, Jesus reminds us of this truth: Worrying about money is pointless.
You can't add a day to your life by worrying. In fact, science tells us that worrying is more likely to
take away days from our lives, so why bother making yourself sick with worry?
Now notice what's going on here. To the rich man who isn't worried about money, God says, money
doesn't matter compared to life and death. To the poor man who is worried about money, God says,
money doesn't matter compared to life and death. We might compare a person who is comfortably
retired with someone who is struggling to make ends meet, and we would probably see that there's a big
difference here, but Jesus is telling us that the difference isn't as great as we might think. Both the rich
and the poor are in danger of the same thing. The rich focus on money more than God, and the poor
focus on money more than God, and for Jesus, it's that focus that is the real tragedy, regardless of the
size of your bank account.
It reminds me of a proverb in the Old Testament, Proverbs 30, verses 8-9 which says, “give me neither
poverty nor riches, but give me only my daily bread. 9
 Otherwise, I may have too much and disown you
and say, 'Who is the LORD?' Or I may become poor and steal, and so dishonor the name of my God.”
See, God doesn't care how much money we have. God only cares about how much attention we pay to
him. God cares whether our values align with his values, and if having a lot of money pulls us away
from God, it's no better than if having a little money pulls us away from God, because here's the main
point: Life isn't about money.
We might think it is, and the world might tell us it is, but when you die, it doesn't matter if you die a
prince or a pauper, because you can't take it with you. God owns the whole world, the whole universe.
How impressed will he be with the pittance that you own? So how do we straighten ourselves out, as
we live in a world that is so set on money, but we serve a God who says that's not the main point?
Jesus starts by giving us the big picture command in verse 29, “Do not set your heart on what you will
eat or drink, do not worry about it” But how, exactly, do we avoid this worry? How do we keep from
setting our hearts on those things? Jesus lays out 4 statements, 4 instructions, to guide us.
First, Jesus says, “The pagan runs after all such things, and your Father knows that you need them.”
Really, the first step in letting go of the money mindset is realizing that we're not in this journey alone.
God is with us, and God knows what we need, so we need to trust in God. He says he'll provide for us,
and we need to take him at his word.
The second instruction that Jesus gives is to set our own minds on the Kingdom. Now we know what
the kingdom is. The kingdom of God, and Jesus talks about it a lot, is the kingdom of Christianity,
where God rules in our own hearts and in the hearts of our fellow believers. So if we are to seek first
God's kingdom, it means that our ultimate priority, and the most important and valuable thing to us,
needs to be seeing God's kingdom grow. We need to desire this growth both in number, by seeing more
and more people accepting Jesus as their savior and choosing to live a life following Him. And we
need to desire to see the kingdom grow in power, by seeing God's rule over our own lives grow and
grow. This means, if we seek first the kingdom, it's going to be a priority to tell others about Jesus.
More importantly, it's going to be a priority for us to follow after Jesus. That might mean refusing to
work on a Sunday morning, or maybe it means coming to church instead of sleeping in, or coming to
Growth group in the middle of the week. Maybe it means waking up extra early to read your Bible, or
choosing to pray as a family after dinner before you turn on the tv. The truth is, we don't always put
Jesus first in our lives. A lot of times we live in a balancing act, where we value family, we value
friends, we value work and possessions, and we relegate Jesus to a back burner for much of the week.
(I know I put Jesus on the back burner sometimes.) But if we seek first the kingdom, that means that
Jesus never goes on the back burner. Instead, we learn to view our families through the lens of serving
God, seeing our role as parents and grandparents as God's task in the kingdom. We learn to view work
through the lens of serving Christ. We start to view our hobbies through the lens of glorifying God.
We learn to ask ourselves, “How can I use the things I already do as opportunities to shine God's light
to those around me?” That's what it looks like when we seek first God's kingdom. And if you think
that one is hard, wait until you hear the next instruction.
Jesus's 3rd command is this: Sell your possessions and give to the poor. By doing this, you are storing
up treasure in heaven. Now, a lot of people have gone to that verse and said that if you own anything
at all, if you don't take a vow of poverty, then you're not really obeying God. Friends, that's how cults
get people to sell their houses, and I don't think that's what Jesus is getting at. Rather, Jesus is pointing
to a fundamental truth. As humans, we are inclined to grab a little too tightly to our worldly
possessions. You need a place to live, and food to eat. In our modern world, you probably need a car.
But if we're honest, there's probably some possessions in your home that you don't need.
For me, it's books. I love books. I have so many books that we've run out of room at our house, and
for every book that I buy, I need to get rid of one. So about every 6 months, I go through my
bookshelves looking for what I can get rid of. And Charity will tell you, it's all I talk about for a couple
of days. I can find a book that I haven't picked up in years, that's been gathering dust for better than a
decade, that I'm sure I'll never pick up and read again, but when I make the decision to get rid of that
book, I feel like a little piece of me is dying. That's a possession I'm a little too attached to...and books
become like a god to me.
But it doesn't have to be books. It could be clothes or shoes, maybe it's decorations for your home or
gadgets for your kitchen, or tools. Men, do you have more tools than you really need? It doesn't have
to be something you have too many of, either. Maybe it's a possession that you yearn for and crave,
like the newest phone, the bigger TV, a nicer boat. Whatever material item consumes your thoughts,
whatever worldly possession captures your worship, sell that. And give the proceeds away. Don't buy
that. Buy food for the poor instead. Yes, selling everything you possess will certainly end your love 
affair with consumer goods, but we don't all need to take vows of poverty. We do, however, need to
make sure that we are loosening our grip, and keeping consumer goods from consuming us.
So first, trust that God will provide you your needs. Second, make the kingdom your first and foremost
priority that you seek. Third, let go of those goods that steal your attention from God and keep you
rooted in the things of this world. Finally, Jesus gives one last piece of advice – put your treasure
where you want your heart to be.
The truth is, we will invest our money and our time in the things that we love. So if you want your
love to be centered on God, if you want your heart to be centered on the kingdom, put your money and
your time and your energy and your thoughts on those things. Yes, that can include tithing every
Sunday, but it also includes giving food to Semcac, or taking friends out for lunch with a mind of
encouraging them. It includes teaching Sunday School, signing up to serve at church, volunteering in
your community. Because our money is a treasure, but our time is also a treasure. Our energy and
effort are our treasures, and if we put our treasure into things that will build God's kingdom, our hearts
will follow. That's the promise that Jesus makes.
Friends, today's lesson isn't really about money, it's about the heart. It's about having a heart for Jesus
and a heart for God, and not having a heart for the things of this world. It doesn't matter if you're rich
or poor, the world and worldly things fight for our affections. But God wants our heart, and we want to
give God our hearts. So trust that God will provide you with what you need. Seek first and foremost
the growth of God's kingdom . Release your stranglehold on the things of this world. And put your
treasure – your time, your money, your energy – into things that will pay off eternal dividends. Don't
be like the pagans who strive after the world. Rather, be like Jesus, and have a heart for God's
kingdom. Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",1/24/2016,
"Zion...Evangelical...Church...
The name rolls off of our tongues so easily that we don't often consider what it means. Three separate
words, but together, they are so much more.
'Zion' This word comes from the Old Testament, from the poets and the prophets. It is the name of the
city of God when the heavenly city comes down to earth in Revelation. When God makes his
permanent dwelling with man, and there is no pain, no tears, no death, no hunger, this is what it looks
like in the city of Zion. It is the place where God abides.
And then there is 'Church', from the Greek word, 'Ecclesia', which means, ""Those who are called out
and set apart"". Church is a gathering place for God's people, the elect, the chosen, believers.
So when we say Zion Church, we are saying that this is a place where people dwell, and this is a place
where God dwells. But how does it come about for people to dwell in the same place as God? And
what activity connects God with people? That is our 3rd word = 'Evangelical'. It comes from the Greek
word, 'Euangellion', which can be translated as ""the good news"" or ""the gospel"". The gospel is Jesus.
That Jesus came to earth – God dwelling with man. That Jesus died on the cross – offering himself as a
sacrifice for our sins. That Jesus rose from the dead - entering into a new and eternal life, and paving
the way for us to enter into new and eternal life. That's the good news. That's the gospel. That's the
""euangellion"".
So ""Zion Evangelical Church"" means, “The place where people dwell with God through the good news
of Jesus Christ.” It's a great name for a church, but there's another word we get from this word,
""euangelion"", and that's Evangelism. Evangelism simply means to tell others about the gospel, to share
the good news, and you would think that this is an easy thing to do. After all, if you get a promotion at
work, you're excited to tell everyone. If you buy a new car, you can't wait to show it off to your
friends. If you get written about in the newspaper (other than the police blotter for speeding), you're
happy for everyone to know about it. These things are good news, and good news is meant to be
shared.
But when it comes to Evangelism, we don't always feel that way. We imagine people knocking on our
door and berating us. We remember times we've been very uncomfortable talking about God. And
even though we all agree that Jesus is good news, it's so much easier to talk about the weather or the
Vikings. But we are God's people. We dwell in the place that God dwells. And frankly, it's wrong for
us not to share that good news.
Now today is our Annual Meeting, and each year, during the Pastor's Report, I set out some goals that
will guide how we do church. This year, as I met with the council this year to seek what God wants us
to do, the resounding answer is that we want to be reaching out in our community and sharing the good
news of the gospel. I'll talk about it more at the annual meeting, but since you're probably listening to
me more closely right now, I want to talk about that goal.
There are reasons that we should evangelize, and reasons that we don't evangelize. Jesus's lesson today
deals with those 2nd reasons: why we don't evangelize. But before we get into that, I want to answer,
“Why should we evangelize?” A lot of churches evangelize for bad reasons: they want more money in
the offering plate, or they are worried about their attendance decreasing. Maybe they even evangelize
because they think it earns them points in heaven, and all of those are terrible reasons to evangelize. 
You know what's a good reason to evangelize? It's what God designed us to do. One of the most
common illustrations that the Bible uses is comparing people to plants, whether it's Jesus is the vine
and we are the branches, or it's God comparing the wheat and the chaff, or it's Christians showing the
fruit of the Spirit. Like fruit, there is a life cycle to our Christianity. There are times when our main
purpose is to grow and mature and bear fruit, and there are other times, where we are supposed to give
off our seeds, sowing the seed of the gospel. Now here at Zion church, we've spent the last few years
focused mainly on our own maturity, growing as believers, growing in our fellowship, and investing in
our children. Those are all good things. But now I'd like to to turn our focus on making sure we are
reproducing our faith, sharing the good news, planting seeds around us. It's part of our design. God
wants us to evangelize.
The problem is we don't always want to evangelize, and why not? Well, we're back onto fear. Too
often, we're afraid of evangelizing. We're afraid of opening our mouths and speaking the truth. We're
afraid that others are going to reject us. We're afraid that we won't know what to say. But Jesus knew
how scary it could be, so as Jesus was preparing the disciples for after he left, he spoke to them to
address their fears, and Jesus addresses these 3 fears today: the fear of speaking, the fear of rejection,
and the fear of not knowing what to say. And He does it all in this one little passage.
Our passage begins with Jesus saying, ""I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of
Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God. 9
 But he who disowns me before men will be
disowned before the angels of God. Now this first statement should scare you. I know it scares me,
because Jesus talks about acknowledging or disowning us in the presence of the angels of God. The
next time that you, Jesus, and the angels will all be in a room is when you're standing before the
judgment throne. So what Jesus is saying here is that if we don't acknowledge Jesus in front of people,
Jesus won't acknowledge us in front of God.
And I think of all the people in this world who are persecuted for their faith, those who are being
imprisoned or beheaded, and they're told, “Just deny Jesus. Just change your religion. And we'll let
you go free.”, but they don't do it. They stand up for Jesus. They won't disown Him, and so Jesus
won't disown them. Then I think to those social gatherings I've been at where someone loudly says,
""Anyone who believes in God is an idiot."", or ""Every Christian I've ever met is a hypocrite"", or ""Jesus
was a good man, but he was just a man."", and I didn't say anything because I didn't want to make
waves. Or I think of those times when I was asked, ""So what do you do?"", and a little sheepishly I say,
""I'm a pastor"". I'm sheepish, because all too often, just that statement leads to a debate. Then I think of
those times, when some friend comes to me with a problem, and I give them all sorts of worldly advice,
""Be the bigger person"", ""Think about what really matters"", ""Put yourself in their shoes."", or something
like that, when what I really should have been saying is this: ""You're having this problem because
you're living in darkness, and the solution to your sin isn't being better, or kinder, or more committed.
The solution to your problem is Jesus."" But I don't say that because it runs the risk of getting really
uncomfortable, really fast. Really...Who cares if it's uncomfortable? Is it worth denying Jesus? Is it
worth risking that He will deny you? It's far better (and safer) for us to be bold and speak up.
But you know what else? The truth is – most of the time our fears are unfounded. We think it'll cause
all sorts of problems if we speak up about Jesus, but most of the time, it doesn't. I've never had
someone get mad at me when I offered to pray for them, and I've never had someone get mad at me for
answering a question honestly. More often than not, I get an apology rather than a fight. After all, your
friends already know that you care about them, and your family knows that you love them, so while
they might not agree, they also won't disown. We find ourselves fearful of something that will never
happen, but willing to risk separating ourselves from Christ because of those fears. 
Friends, Jesus says, don't be afraid to acknowledge me. It's worth speaking up. That's the first fear that
Jesus addresses: the fact that we're afraid to say anything at all. The second fear that Jesus addresses is
the fear of rejection, because for a lot of us, that's what we're really afraid of - that even if they don't
sever the friendship, they'll reject our message, and we'll have made things awkward for no real
purpose. But Jesus counters that fear by turning to a very surprising subject: the unforgiveable sin.
Did you know that there is a sin that God will not forgive? A sin that is unforgivable? That's pretty
scary to think about. What's even scarier is that pastors and theologians don't really know what this
unforgivable sin is. We make our guesses, but there's not even a consensus opinion. We all struggle
with this question. (Now we'll talk about the unforgivable sin in greater depth this Wednesday and I'll
answer any questions you might have, so come out to growth group at 6:30) But I want to start by
reassuring you that the 1 thing every commentary and every theologian agrees on is that Christians
can't commit this sin.
Still, it's a tough one to understand. In verse 10, Jesus says, ""everyone who speaks a word against the
Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.”
But what is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit? Well, we start to find an answer in Matthew 12 and
Mark 3. In those places, Jesus also talks about the unforgivable sin, but there's a context to it. Jesus
brings it up immediately after he's cast out a demon, and the Pharisees attributed this miracle to the
devil. (We covered that story back in November, in Luke chapter 11) Matthew and Mark tell us that at
a very minimum, the unforgivable sin is seeing Jesus work a miracle and claiming it's the devil's work.
That's the key, because the power by which Jesus did his miracles was the power of the Holy Spirit.
When Jesus was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended on Him, and that's when Jesus started his ministry.
So Jesus is criticized, even blasphemed, and he says, ""You can say whatever you want about me, that
can be forgiven, but when you see the Holy Spirit working, and you criticize, condemn, and blaspheme
that, there's no forgivenness.” And the reason, I believe, that there's no forgiveness there is that the
Holy Spirit is the one who convicts us of our sin. The Holy Spirit is the one who leads us to God, and
if you dig in your heels and harden your heart against the Holy Spirit, who can bring you to
repentance? Can it even be done? Jesus says no.
Now switch over to Luke, where we find this idea – blaspheming the Holy Spirit – not in response to
Jesus's miracle, but in response to our witness. With that, we discover a wonderful truth. It's not you
or me that people are rejecting when they reject the gospel. It may not even be the message that we're
bringing. If they dig in their heels and they harden their hearts, then they're moving against the Holy
Spirit, not us. Remember, when we become followers of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit made a dwelling
in us, just like he dwelt in Jesus.
That – incidentally – is why Christians can't commit the unforgivable sin. How can we reject the Holy
Spirit and accept the Holy Spirit at the same time? WE CAN'T!
But just like Jesus said, “You can reject me without problem, but be careful how you treat the Holy
Spirit.” We, too, have to have this attitude. It doesn't matter if they reject us. It doesn't matter if they
think we're too religious, too preachy, or just plain crazy. None of that matters, but they better be
careful how they treat the Holy Spirit, because if they dig their heels in too hard, they might end up in
permanent trouble.
Now the comfort of this statement isn't that people might blaspheme the Holy Spirit, no, the comfort of
this statement here is that whether they accept the gospel or reject the gospel, none of this has anything
to do with you. So why should we be afraid of rejection? We shouldn't – because it's not about us. 
And if we weren't sure that it's the Holy Spirit speaking rather than ourselves, let's look at the 3rd fear
that Jesus addresses – the fear of not knowing what to say. In verse 11-12 he says, 11 ""When you are
brought before synagogues, rulers and authorities, do not worry about how you will defend yourselves
or what you will say, 12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what you should say.""
You know, I'll be the first to admit that sometimes we just don't have the answers people are looking
for. I've been in lots of situations where we're talking about God, and somebody has asked me a deep
theological question, or they've asked advice for a situation where there's no good answer, or they've
wondered why God would allow some tragedy to take place, and I've been stumped, many times. But
I've also had a lot of times where I've been stumped, I haven't had an answer and I haven't known the
words to say. Then, all of a sudden, a Bible verse pops into my head, or I remember some sermon I
heard 10 years prior. I pass on the message and the response I get is, ""That's exactly what I needed to
hear"". In fact, this has happened so many times, it can't be a coincidence, it has to be something more.
If the last point – about the unforgivable sin – is that when people reject the gospel, they're not rejecting
us, but they're rejecting the words of the Holy Spirit through us, then this point just proves it. We are
weak vessels. No matter how much we study or practice evangelism, we aren't worthy of carrying
God's banner, but the Holy Spirit lives in us, and the Holy Spirit tells us what to say, and He makes use
of the Scripture that we know. He makes use of the sermons we've heard. Sometimes, He even gives
us words of wisdom that we never could have come up with on our own.
And that's the promise that Jesus makes! When we get called on the carpet by authorities, when we get
questions designed to stump us, or we find people searching for an answer to a really hard question, it's
not about saying the perfect thing. No, it's about letting the Holy Spirit speak through you. And Yes,
there's ways we can enhance it: knowing the Bible, talking with others about God (even here at
church). But at the end of the day, Jesus promises us that it's the Holy Spirit who gives us the right
words for the right moment. I've had this happen enough times to know that it's true. If we put
ourselves in a situation to be used, God will make sure that He uses us, and God will make sure He
equips us.
So friends, I know that sharing the good news of the gospel is scary. It's scary for me too. But it's what
we were designed by God to do, so it's worth the discomfort, and it's worth facing our fears, because
Jesus tells us that unless we acknowledge Him before men, He won't acknowledge us in front of the
Father. And it's worth risking rejection, because Jesus tells us that when people reject us, they're not
really rejecting us, they're rejecting the message, and they're rejecting the Holy Spirit who gives us that
message. And it's worth opening our mouths, because Jesus promises us that when we think we're out
of our depth and we enter a situation where we just don't know what we're going to say, if we're willing
to face our fears and be used, then GOD WILL USE YOU. He will give us his words, and his message
through his Holy Spirit. Friends,, do not be afraid to share good news. Rather, trust in God, and face
your fears.

"One of the most enduring pieces of literature is Nicolo Machiavelli's book, ""The Prince"". It was
written in the early 1500s, and it is considered the first book on political philosophy. He wrote it after
being imprisoned in Italy for conspiracy against the ruling family, the Medicis. He wrote it as a gift to
the young heir to the throne, hoping that this manual of political shrewdness would be a sufficient
offering to get him set free.
It's an enduring book, but it's not a good book. It advocates for all sorts of domineering behavior by the
ruling class. One of the most famous ideas it introduced is that ""The end justifies the means"", which is
to say, as long as you accomplish the goal you desire – the end, it doesn't matter what cruelties or evils
you have to commit to get there. A good end justifies awful means. That idea alone has been used by
people in power to commit all sorts of atrocities against everyday, normal people. But while that may
be it's most famous point, it's not the main point of the book. The main point of the book is that there
are 2 motivations that move people more than any others: fear and love. While people will do more for
those they love than for those they fear, it's easier to keep people in fear, than to keep people in love.
So for a ruling prince, Machiavelli writes, the best and most enduring way of keeping the commoners
in line and doing what you want them to is keeping them in fear.
Now I'm not a fan of the book, The Prince. It is at odds with the Bible on a number of points, and so I
disagree with it on a number of points, but we can't deny that fear is a giant motivator for most people.
The reason I bring it up at all is that Jesus knows this, and spends much of Luke chapter 12 discussing
the subject of fear. Last week, as we entered chapter 12, Jesus was talking about being careful to avoid
hypocrisy, and I suggested that our motivation for being hypocritical is that we struggle with something
called, ""Fear of Man"". This is where we care too highly about other people's opinions, and this takes
many forms: giving into peer pressure, becoming a giant people-pleaser who can't say no, trying to
""keep up with the Jones's"", or maybe it's as simple as trying to put your best face on in public (and
being very embarrassed anytime someone sees you in a less than perfect situation. All of these are
examples of when we're motivated by ""Fear of Man"". I used to think that ""Fear of Man"" was the
biggest fear that most people faced. (Of course, that was when I was still in school and my job was
working with teenagers.) So I agreed when someone said to me this week, ""I think younger people
struggle with that more than older people"". But there's another fear, one that young people don't really
think about all that often, but one that we think about more and more the older we get: the fear of death.
Death is a scary thing. It's probably the most universal fear of all because everybody dies. And when
we die, we have to cross that threshold alone. Nobody in our lives has come back to tell us what's on
the other side. We are told – in the Bible – what awaits us, but even those people were still alive when
they wrote it. And one of the most sobering experiences I've had as a pastor is sitting at the bedside of
someone who is at the end of their life, and hearing their fears and doubts. Life-long Christians ,
people that have spent more years in church than I've been alive, people who earlier said that they were
absolutely positive where they are going when they die, but when they're at that precipice staring death
in the face, all of a sudden, they wonder, “Have I really been all that good? Can God really forgive the
awful things I've done? Is it true that I'm going to find myself in heaven when I open my eyes? How
can I be sure?” If people that I see as pillars of the faith have those doubts, what hope is there for you
and me when we are staring death in the eyes? It's scary.
So when Jesus says, ""Do not fear those who kill the body"", he's talking about not fearing death, but he's
also talking about something more specific because he knew what challenges the disciples were going
to face. The disciples didn't know that following Jesus was going to be costly for them, but Jesus did.
There were 12 disciples. We know that Judas betrayed Jesus and hung himself, and we know that John
wasn't killed, he was exiled on the island of Patmos. But the other 10 disciples - They were crucified, 
stoned, beaten, set on fire, thrown off of buildings. Any way that you could think to kill someone, one
of the disciples experienced it. They all, as far as we can tell, died for their faith. Yet Jesus says,
""Don't fear the one who will kill you."", ""Don't fear death."", “Don't fear those who will bring death"".
And what he said must have stuck because none of them denied Jesus to live. None of them ran away
from their deaths. They willingly died for the cause of Christ. How did Jesus convince them? We
need to pay attention. We, normal Christians, need to hear Jesus's message, because he gives us 2
reasons not to fear our deaths no matter what may come.
The first reason that Jesus gives is that we shouldn't fear death, because there's something bigger to
fear. Jesus said, ""I tell you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do
no more. And then in verse 5.
5
 But I will show you whom you should fear: Fear him who, after the
killing of the body, has power to throw you into hell.”
See the worst that another person can do is to kill the body. After that, they can't inflict any more harm,
but God can do something far worse. No matter how death comes, no matter how heinously someone
can kill you, God is the one who will sit in judgment and has the authority to send us to Hell. Now
remember, Jesus is talking to the disciples here primarily, so this is for us. If God wanted to send us to
Hell, he would be justified in doing that because there's nobody here today who hasn't sinned. There's
nobody here today who's perfectly obeyed God, and the punishment for sin is an eternity in hell, which
is a fate far worse than death.
But do we believe in Hell? It's surprising, but more people in America believe in Heaven than believe
in Hell. We have books and movies that convince us that Heaven is for real, but do we believe that
Hell is for real too? And more importantly, do we believe that people we know - upstanding good
citizens, friendly neighbors - if they don't have faith in Jesus Christ and if they don't follow after God,
do we believe that they're destined for a place called Hell? I suspect that most of us, if we were asked
directly, would say that we believe in Hell, but I'm not sure we really live our lives that way (I'm not
sure * I * live my life that way), believing that people I love and care for might be headed there, or
believing that the only thing that keeps me from Hell is God's grace and Jesus's sacrifice. If we figure
out what we really believe based on how we live our lives, I suspect that many of us don't take Hell
very seriously.
I'm reminded of an interview I saw with Penn Jillette, the magician. He's the guy from Penn and Teller,
the one who talks, and he's made his career out of showing people why they shouldn't believe in magic.
He doesn't believe in God either, but in this interview, he said that he really appreciates those who talk
to him about God. Friends who come, urgently, because even though he doesn't believe it, if Hell is a
real place, and if he has friends who believe he would go there because he's an atheist, he appreciates
that they care enough about him to bring up the subject. If we really believe that people we love and
know are in danger of spending an eternity in torment and suffering, the least we can do is bring it up.
If we really believe that for all the hope we have in death, we have neighbors who ought to have equal
amounts of dread, then we have to say something, even if they don't like it, even if it makes us
unpopular. We can't ignore it if we truly believe that Hell is a real place. I'm not saying we need to be
mean or callous, but we can't be silent, because Hell is something to be afraid of.
But notice, Jesus doesn't say, “Don't fear death, fear Hell”. No – what Jesus says is, “Don't fear death,
fear the one who can send you to Hell”, so what does it mean to fear God? Well, like any fear – healthy
or unhealthy - there are 3 components to showing fear is real. First, it starts with a real respect of those
people or things that we fear. Second, it acknowledges our own limitations. Finally, third, and most
importantly, it changes our behavior. I started by saying that fear was one of the great motivators in 
life, and it's true. Let me give you an example -
On Thursday night, Charity and I went to the basketball game in Caledonia. It was a cold rainy
evening, that turned into a cold icy night, and so we had, a good reasonable fear, about the drive home.
We respected the fact that dark, icy roads could be dangerous, even deadly. And we acknowledged that
we might not see or respond quickly enough to an icy patch. So we changed our behavior. We drove
home slower than normal. If we weren't afraid (or if we were foolish), we might have sped home going
75 miles an hour, but we didn't. We were afraid of the icy roads.
Or take heights - If you're afraid of heights, it's because you know it will hurt a lot or kill you even to
fall from that height. You acknowledge your limitations. You don't have wings, so if you fall, you're
falling all the way. Finally, you change your behavior. You hold onto a rail, or you don't climb high, or
you don't look down.
Fear of God is the same. It begins with a respect of God's power - He's bigger than us, He's our creator
and our judge, and He has the authority to send any one of us to Hell. It continues with an
acknowledgment of our limitations. We are but people. We are creatures made by God. And we are
sinful, deserving to be punished severely. Finally, fear of God brings about a change in behavior.
Maybe it's trying to not live so sinfully. Better, maybe it's coming to church more often to learn about
God. Or even better yet – it's making the choice to believe in Jesus, believing that even though we
deserve Hell, we choose to put our faith in the promise that Jesus offers us forgiveness and shows us
the path to heaven. That's the change we want to have - believing and trusting in Jesus. So fearing
God, though it may sound bad and we often don't talk about God in that way, ultimately, it's a healthy
and reasonable fear that ought to motivate us to come to Christ.
But do you remember The Prince? That book by Machiavelli about how to control the masses? And it
said, “Fear is a more reliable motivator, but love is a more powerful motivator.” This brings us to
Jesus' 2nd reason why we shouldn't fear death. It's not about fearing God, but recognizing that God
loves us and cares about us, because Jesus's teaching goes on...
6
 Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God. 7
 Indeed, the very
hairs of your head are all numbered. Don't be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.
See...God sees everything. And Jesus uses the example of the little sparrow, not even worth a penny a
piece to demonstrate that fact. Many of us wouldn't even bother to pick up a penny, but sparrows were
one of the animals you could sacrifice. If you had wealth, you could sacrifice a lamb, but if you had
nothing, you still could sacrifice a sparrow. So these sparrows, that in human terms are practically
worthless, God cares about them. He knows when they're born. He knows when they die. He provides
food and shelter for them. God loves them
And He loves so much more. Even the hairs on our head are numbered. Such a trivial thing, but God
cares about that. That's how much God loves me. And you. His highest creation was people, and
those that follow Jesus, we're his children. And immeditely after Jesus makes the point to say that it is
right and justifiable that we should fear God, that we should fear God more than we fear death. that we
should fear God more than we should fear man, Jesus adds this little statement. Don't fear God, love
God, because God loves you.
Friends, there is a verse in 1 John 4, where John writes, ""We have come to know and to believe the love
that God has for us...There is no fear in love. Perfect love casts out fear."" Should people fear God?
Absolutely people should, because God is the one that we all have to answer to, because God is 
perfectly holy, because God will not tolerate sin in his presence, because God has the authority to send
people to Hell, and because Hell is a very real place, full of very real suffering.
But should we, as believers, be afraid? The answer to that is, ""No."" Anyone who has experienced
Jesus has experienced God's love in its fullest. We know that God loves us. We know that God cares.
God's love is perfect, and Perfect love drives away fear. If someone doesn't love God, they need to fear
God. But we don't need to be afraid, because we love God, and we know God loves us.
That's why the disciples were able to go to their deaths so willingly and so bravely. They knew that
fearing death and fearing man was a small thing compared to fearing God, but they also knew fearing
God was a small thing to loving God.
Friends, God loves you. Live your life in His love. Let us pray....",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",1/10/2016,
"In the wake of 9/11, a few days after the terror attacks, two prominent, well-respected pastors took to
the television and had a stunning conversation. Pat Robertson, the founder of the moral majority, and
Jerry Falwell, the founder of Liberty University, talked on the Robertson's show, the 700 Club, and
Jerry Falwell said that 9/11 was God's judgment on the United States. We had taken prayer out of the
schools, we had allowed our culture to become secular, and we embraced sinful movements, like
normalizing homosexuality. It was scandalous and the pushback was incredible, not only from those
that Falwell mentioned , but from pastors and churches throughout the country. Anyone who had a
voice denounced this notion. They demanded that these men clarify their statements, and they did.
They clarified that the terrorists were solely responsible for their actions. They explained that they
were just saying that God allowed, not caused the tragedy. And after that, they stopped speaking out
about it. They stopped using 9/11 to push their political points. But the truth is, although this may
have been one of the more memorable examples because these men were so well known, almost
every time there is a tragedy in the world, talking heads from the Christian community line up trying to
explain that these tragic events are the result of God's judgment.
It's not just famous pastors that do this, and it's not just massive terrorist attacks and natural disasters.
Have you ever done it? Life is going along just fine when something terrible happens: your car breaks
down, you lose your job, someone in your family is injured or diagnosed with illness. At first, there's a
feeling of shock, you don't know how to react, but after a little while when you've taken stock of the
news. In those lonely moments early in the morning or before you fall asleep, you find your mind
turning to God, and you find yourself asking, ""Why God? Why would you let this happen to me?""
Perhaps you're persistent in that thought and you think of the sins you've committed in your life, “Is it
because I did something to make you angry, God?"" Or you think of those times where you didn't live
up, you missed church, you didn't read your Bible, and you wonder, ""God, would you have allowed this
if I had been doing those things?"" Or maybe you think of your failures, the ways that you failed as a
husband or wife, the ways you've failed as a parent, and you heap this blame on yourself and ask
""God, did I deserve this?"" Have you ever done that? I know I have.
Psychologists will call this the bargaining stage of grief, but I think there's something more. We don't
want to imagine that God is somehow unfair or unjust. We don't want to imagine that God would let us
suffer without cause. We don't want to face the fact that God allows random tragedies. There's a
comfort in the connection between sin and suffering. And this idea isn't a new phenomenon, in fact,
it's as old as human history, and it's exactly what we see going on in our passage this morning.
Jesus is teaching, doing his thing, when all of a sudden some of the people present come to him with
news of a tragedy. They told him of the Galileans whose blood Pilate mixed with the sacrifice. Now
I'm pretty sure this is an idiom or a euphemism. Yes, it's possible that Pilate took their blood and
mixed it with the sacrifices on the altar (we don't know for sure, there's no record of this event outside
of Luke), but really, it's not likely. What's more likely is that one Saturday, all these Galileans were
gathering at the temple. They offered sacrifices, and then went to a teaching time, and because they
were all together, and because they were upset at being oppressed, they decided to form an
insurrection - a rebellion. Pilate, being the governor wanted to put down the rebellion, so he had his
soldiers kill the rebellious Galileans. So we might imagine that when Jesus hears the news at the
same time as the crowd, the crowd would have had lots of questions. ""Who does Jesus stand with,
the Romans or the Galileans?"" ""Would Jesus lead a rebellion too?"" ""Did these Galileans deserve to
be killed for their insurrection?"" ""Or Did the Galileans have some other sin in their life that led to this
terrible end?""
But Jesus, knowing the hearts of men, had a question of his own. “Do you think the Galileans were
worse than anybody else because they suffered this way? No, they weren't.” They didn't suffer and
die because they were particularly bad sinners. They were just in the wrong place and time. But then
Jesus takes it a step further. ""I tell you, unless YOU repent, you will all perish.""
See, when the crowd heard of this tragedy, they assumed it was some sort of karma at play. Maybe
they had been particularly evil or had sinned in some gruesome way. And when they heard that there
was no gruesome sin, I'm sure they were thinking, “Wow, this is really unjust,” or “Wow, they were
really unlucky.” But Jesus's response is this: “They deserved to die...and so do you...unless you
repent, you will perish.” This is a shocking turn of conversation. The crowd wanted to know what evil
they had done to deserve this tragedy, and Jesus says, ""They're no worse than you, in fact, you
deserve the same fate as them!""
The 2nd illustration is similar to the first: ""Do you remember those 18 who died when the tower in
Siloam fell on them?” Incidentally, we don't know when or how this tower fell, but we can imagine that
a falling tower is just the kind of tragic accident that makes us wonder about God, life, and fairness.
""Remember those 18...do you think they were more guilty than others living in Jerusalem? They
weren't. In fact, you are just as guilty, and unless you repent, you, too, will perish."" So Jesus does it
again. The crowd is assuming that there must be some significance to the fact that these people died,
and Jesus says, ""No, it was just their time. You have your time too, so worry about yourself and
repent rather than worrying about them.""
It reminds me of the book of Job. You know the story, but in case you don't, Job is a book in the Old
Testament. It is the oldest book of the Bible, and it's a pretty long one, weighing in at 42 chapters.
The story of Job is that Job was a righteous man who loved God and honored God, but God let the
devil test him. See the devil had made the accusation that Job only obeyed because God blessed
him, and God responded, “Go ahead, take away the blessings, we'll see if Job continues to obey.”
So Job suffered all sorts of calamities to his property, his family, and even his own body, but in the
end, Job never denounced God. At the end of the test, God blessed him with twice as much as
before. But that whole story is found in the first and last chapter of Job. The middle chapters are a
bunch of conversations that Job has with his friends. His friends are convinced that Job deserves this
punishment somehow, and they keep telling Job, “God doesn't allow bad things to happen to good
people, you must have sinned somehow.” And Job kept responding back, “I know I didn't sin. I don't
know why God is punishing me like this, but I know I didn't sin.”
See, as far back as humanity goes, we have this idea that sin and suffering are related. Of course,
they are in a grand scale. There was no suffering before Adam sinned. Sin brought suffering into the
world. But we go further to think that our specific suffering has to have a root cause. The Bible tells
us again and again, in Job, here in Luke, in John with the man born blind, even in people's response
to the cross (some thought Jesus must be a sinner to have died in that manner), the Bible tells us that
suffering in life is not a direct result of our sins.
If a tree falls on your house, if you slip and fall and break yourself on the ice, if you go to the doctor
and are diagnosed with cancer, Jesus is telling us it's not a specific sin that brought these things on.
This is part of living in a fallen world. God doesn't work that way.
Sometimes, I think we wish it was that way. and there's 3 reasons why this idea is comforting. First, if
sin and suffering were related, then we could avoid suffering by avoiding sin. And if we just knew
which sins brought which suffering, then we could be in charge of our own destiny. Why do the
crowds always ask which sins they've committed? Because they don't want to suffer. None of us do.
If we knew that every time we took the Lord's name in vain, we would stub our toe. Or every time we
stole something, we would have financial distress. Or every time we lied to someone, someone would
gossip about us. And if we had a day where we did all 3, that's the day that we would wreck the car.
So we think that if only we knew the code, the correlation, between our sin and God's punishment,
then we could know what sins we wanted to avoid, and which times the suffering would be worth it.
Another reason we might prefer this idea of tit-for-tat suffering is that it brings order to our world. It
would let us rest in the knowledge that those who suffer deserve their suffering. It would let us
imagine a God who works in the same way that humans work. If God did that, letting us suffer only
when we sin, then we could understand that God. In fact, we could control that God. We'd feel a lot
more powerful, and a lot more confident about our place in the world. And the world would make more
sense do us.
But the 3rd reason that we would like this is the biggest, and it's the reason that Jesus seems to be
getting at as he reminds the people that they are sinners too. If the only time we suffer is when we
sinned, if our sins were always met with equal amounts of punishment, then we could look at our lives
when everything is going well and conclude, without a doubt, that everything is fine spiritually as well.
If we're not suffering, then God must have no problem with us. But Jesus responds to this idea by
telling the crowd, they were no worse sinners than you. Repent, or you will perish too. In other words,
you want something to be wrong with them that caused their suffering, because then you know that if
you aren't suffering, God is happy and pleased with you. And that's not the way it is.
So Jesus launches into a story in verse 6. 6
 Then he told this parable: ""A man had a fig tree, planted
in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any. 7
 So he said to the man who
took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and
haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?' 8
 ""'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone
for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it. 9
 If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it
down.'""
Now in an agricultural community like ours, you probably understand the earthly part of the parable
better than your city-boy pastor. The tree should have been bearing fruit by this time – the 3rd year –
and it was taking up valuable space in the vineyard, so if it was a bad tree, better to rip it out of the
ground and plant a new one than waste precious time and space with this useless tree. But whenever
we come to a parable, the first thing we have to do is identify the characters. In other words – who are
we?
Well, we know that the owner of the vineyard is God. God is always the owner. And the fig tree is
people like the crowd who were hearing Jesus, and people like the Galileans killed and the men who
died in the tower. The fig tree is people who are deserving of death because of their sin.
And this is conversation is a monumental one in the life of the tree, because the fate of the tree is
decided in this conversation, but absolutely nothing changed about the tree on this day. It didn't
suddenly start bearing fruit (maybe it will in the future, or maybe it won't, we're not told). The only
thing that changed in the life of the tree was the day that it would be torn out of the ground and
destroyed, the day that the tree would die.
So the message of this parable for the crowd who was listening to Jesus is that those men who were
killed in Galilee or the tower of Siloam, they were trees in their 3rd year who were ripped out of the
ground, whereas the crowd who was hearing Jesus, they were the trees given a reprieve for one more
year. In other words, even though they were comfortable, and even though they weren't suffering, if
they didn't change their ways and start bearing fruit, the suffering they would incur would be absolutely
the same. That's a warning, because while we like to think that suffering is proof of our sin – it's not.
And while we like to think that our comfort is proof that we will never suffer, this parable tells us that
nothing can be further from the truth. And the people in your life who you are praying for, the 5 people
I challenged you to pray for last week, they are examples of the fig tree. Whether they suffer or not,
their fate is the same if they don't change their ways and start bearing fruit.
But that brings us to the gardener who pleads for just one more year. One more year to fertilize the
tree, to care for the tree, to do everything possible to get this tree to change and start bearing fruit.
That gardener, I believe, is the church. The gardener is us. We don't know how long we've been
given, but we've been given a length of time to make a difference, and it's our job to care for those we
love. To plant the seed of the gospel into their lives. To fertilize that seed with our prayer. To shine
the light of God into their lives with our love. And to pray that there's a harvest before their alotted
time is up.
Friends, there's lots to be taken away from this sermon today. We are so often tempted, when we
suffer, to turn to God with questions, and the most common of all the questions is, ""Why is this
happening to me? ""What did I do to deserve this?"" The answer that God tells us in his word again and
again and again is this truth: suffering is a part of life in this fallen world, not a reflection of your
sinfulness.
And yet, when we experience suffering, or we see tragedy affect those around us, it should be a
reminder to us and to the world that life is not permanent on this earth. Someday, death will take us
all, and we need to be ready when it does. That means that if we don't know to whom we belong, the
time to decide is now. And it means that if we claim to be Christians but we aren't showing fruit in our
lives, just because we are comfortable doesn't mean that we'll be spared. But most of us – for us as
believers , this parable reminds us that time is short. There may be a year left. There may be many
years or only a few days. But no matter how much time there is left, we must do all that we can to
bring the dead trees to life. We must do all that we can to plant the gospel into the lives of those we
love, because if the fruitless tree does not change, if a tree is barren and does not repent, the
outcome, sooner or later, is perishing. Friends, let us be like good gardeners, caring for those people
entrusted to us, and seeking to save the lives of those we love. We don't know how much time is left.
Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",1/3/2016,
"Our passage this week is a stark contrast to what's been going on. Jesus has been teaching about
prayer, now Jesus is casting out demons and telling us the truth about demonic possession. These two
ideas actually have something in common, however. Both deal with the unseen reality behind the
visible world, and both lessons are centered on our relationship with God. So while it seems quite
different, it really is just an continuation of the same subject.
Our episode this week begins as we've seen so many others begin. Jesus sees a man who is possessed
by a demon, and Jesus casts the demon out. Now this particular demon was mute, which means that
this demon possessed man was unable to speak. Now there's nothing particularly important about the
fact that this demon caused mute-ness, but the crowd knew that this man was mute. Whether they
realized it was because of a demon, it doesn't say, but we are told, however, that after Jesus cast out the
demon and the man began to speak, the crowd was amazed.
So far, we're following the pattern that we've seen every other time Jesus casts out a demon. Jesus
comes along. He casts out a demon, which results in a change in the possessed man, and the crowd
reacts in amazement. This time, there's another element to the story. Some of them said, ""He is casting
out demons in the name of Beelzebub, the prince of demons."" Now we may not be familiar with the
name Beelzebub, but we are certainly familiar with his namesake: Ba'al. All throughout the Old
Testament, we find God's people going up against the people who worshiped Ba'al, and by this time in
history, it was accepted that just as God was good, Ba'al was evil. The suffix ""-zebub"" means prince, so
Beelzebub is the prince, or the head, of the demons.
Now that is a strange reaction. Who would see this and attribute Jesus's miracles to the devil? Well,
even though Luke doesn't tell us, Matthew does, and Matthew says it was the Pharisees who said this.
Now remember, when the Pharisees first saw Jesus do miracles, they were intrigued. They even sent
people to Jesus, like Jairus because they figured that Jesus's miracles would endow good will between
the powerful Romans and the Jewish leaders. But then Jesus began correcting the Pharisees, and Jesus
began embarrassing them, by telling they didn't love sinners enough. Then when one of their own
came to challenge his teaching, Jesus made the religious class look bad in the parable of the Good
Samaritan. So far, the Pharisees don't hate Jesus (they will soon), but they don't like him either. So
without some other way of explaining how Jesus had the power to do miracles, and definitely not
wanting to say that Jesus was truly from God, they said to anyone who would listen, ""Jesus is casting
out demons by the power of demons. It's all an elaborate ruse.""
Fortunately, Jesus knew their hearts. He used this moment as an opportunity to teach what is really
happening when Jesus casts out demons. There's 3 points that Jesus makes about when he casts out
demons and when he deals with our demons that aren't so obvious.
The first of Jesus's points is that Jesus is coming from heaven with the power of God, “17 Jesus knew
their thoughts and said to them: ""Any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined, and a house
divided against itself will fall. 18 If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? I say
this because you claim that I drive out demons by Beelzebub.
It's a pretty obvious point. The way Jesus states it shows us that. We might make the mistake of
thinking that the first idea, a kingdom divided against itself doesn't stand, is found first in the Bible, but
the way Jesus references makes us realize that this statement doesn't originate with Jesus. I think he's
quoting a maxim or saying that already existed. After all, it's common sense. If the king and the queen
are busy bickering, or if the kings advisers are plotting against him, or if the heir to the throne is 
undermining his father, then it's obvious that the kingdom will fail. So if Jesus really was casting out
demons by the power of the devil, it would be the dumbest thing the devil ever did.
The devil's not dumb. He's full of pride, which was the reason he thought he could battle against God
in the first place. He's sneaky, too. I don't think the devil really cares whether we acknowledge his
power or not. C.S. Lewis said that there were 2 dangers when dealing with the devil: the first is to give
him too much credit, to think that he's as powerful as God. The other is to give him too little credit, to
disbelieve that he has any power at all. I think that's probably our mistake, here in 21st century
America, when it comes to dealing with the devil. See, the Bible tells us that this man was mute
because he was possessed by a demon – a demon of muteness. Today, if we knew someone was mute,
we'd blame their bodies, or we'd blame their minds, but we'd never dream of blaming it on demon
possession. Of course, that's what it was.
Honestly, I think it's possible that a lot of the mental health issues out there are deeper than we might
suppose. Now I'm not saying that everyone with a mental health problem is demon possessed, and I'm
not saying that everyone who battles addition is demon possessed, but maybe when someone says they
hear voices, they really are hearing voices. And maybe when someone feels enslaved to a substance,
they really are enslaved. Maybe it's folly for us to always blame it only and completely on scientific
psychological reasons.
So the devil is proud and sneaky, but he isn't dumb, and he wouldn't work against himself like the
Pharisees thought he was doing, so that leaves only one other option: Jesus was casting out demons
through the power of God. Just in case the Pharisees missed that, Jesus then drives the point home with
another question he asks them next, “If you think I'm casting out demons by the devil's power, then by
whose power are you casting out demons?”
See, the Pharisees couldn't claim that they were doing good through God's power, and that Jesus was
doing good through the devil's power. God and the devil don't have the same goals, and they don't do
the same things, so we know that Jesus is from God. Since Jesus is from God, this means that the
Kingdom of God has come to the world. Jesus is starting to bring the kingdom to earth.
The 2nd point that Jesus makes about himself is that he is stronger than the devil. Last week, we heard
Jesus compare God the Father to a frustrated neighbor. This week, Jesus compares himself to a robber
and a thief. In verse 21, he says this, “When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own house, his
possessions are safe. But when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him, he takes away the
armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils.”
In this example, the strong man is the devil, and he is guarding his own house. His house is people. In
the same way that the Holy Spirit lives resides in us once we become Christians, the devil resides in
people who are demon possessed and in people who are evil. The Bible tells us that before Christ, we
were all evil, so the house is any person who is under the control and authority of the devil. In other
words, the house is anyone who is caught up in sin.
Now I don't need to tell you that the devil is strong. We've all been tempted to sin, and we've all given
into sin. In those moments when the temptation to sin is at its peak, right before we succumb, whether
it's lashing out in anger, bending the line morally, or giving into some action that you know is wrong
but you do it anyway, the devil's power to cause us to sin is very strong. It seems insurmountable, and
we're just average people.
If we look to the Old Testament, all the great heroes, they also sinned. Adam disobeyed a direct order
from God. Abraham was a liar. Moses was a murderer. Noah was a drunk. Jonah ran from God.
David was an adulterer, which is about the nicest word we can use for a guy who forced himself on the
woman, Bathsheba. They all sinned, and those were the good guys, the heroes. We're not even talking
about the bad people in the Bible.
It's obvious just how strong and powerful the devil is, but Jesus is stronger. He comes into the devil's
house, all those people who are controlled and motivated by sin, and he attacks and overpowers the
devil. In Matthew, it says he binds him up, tying his hands and feet, and forces the devil out of those
people he used to control.
The truth is none of us could be Christians if Jesus wasn't more powerful than the devil. When Adam
brought sin into the world, we all became captives of the devil. If Jesus wasn't strong enough to come
along, bind the devil hand and foot, steal is weapons and banish him from his own house, then we'd
still be captives of the devil. But Jesus was strong enough to redeem us. Jesus was strong enough to
set us free. And whatever sin you face in your life today, Jesus is strong enough to overcome that as
well. We just need to trust in his power. We just need to go to him in prayer.
So Jesus is using this moment where he casts out a demon to make some powerful spiritual points.
First, Jesus is good, and He comes from God. Second, He is more powerful than the devil and has the
power to set us free. The 3rd point, and this might be the most important, is that if we are set free, but
we don't cling to Jesus, sin is going to come back and we'll go back over to the devil, and it'll be worse
than ever before. Verse 24: ""When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places
seeking rest and does not find it. Then it says, 'I will return to the house I left.' When it arrives, it finds
the house swept clean and put in order. Then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than
itself, and they go in and live there. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first.""
I want to tell you a story that illustrates this point exactly. Before I became a pastor, many of you know
I worked in the automotive industry. We sold and fixed starters and alternators. It was a specialized
field, and like many specialized fields, everyone who was in it knew each other. There was one guy in
particular, that everybody knew, his name was Bob. He had been in the industry his whole life, and for
the last 20 years of his career, he had been hired on as a specialist, going around the country leading
seminars. He was the expert of experts, but he also was a notorious drinker. In his 50s, he was told
that he was in danger of developing cirrhosis, so this notorious drunk joined a 12 step program, and he
did really well with it. After a day of teaching, when everyone attending the seminar would go out,
he'd still go out with them, but he'd pull out his sobriety chip for all to see, and he'd sip on a diet coke.
The time on the chip piled up. First a month, then 6 months, a year, 5 years. By the time I met him, he
was well on his way to his 10 year chip, but then something terrible happened. We were at a
convention in Orlando Florida, and Bob fell off the wagon. For the next day, the subject was on
everyone's lips. Nobody could believe that after more than 10 years sober, we would ever find him
drinking again. A few guys I know talked to him over those next few days, but Bob told them all the
same thing, “It's nothing. Someone bought me a drink, I had to oblige. I'm just drinking this week, but
after the convention I'm done with it all.”
Only that's not what happened. I swear, it wasn't 3 months later before we heard that Bob had died.
His liver had failed. Bob had gotten free of his demons once, but when they came back, he was no
match for them.
Jesus tells us that this is the way things are. And this is the most important point of the story for us, 
because we know that Jesus is from God, and we know that Jesus is stronger than Satan, but a lot of
times, when Jesus sets us free from a sin, we think that battle is over. We think the fight's been won.
But it hasn't.
In the Bible, when Jesus healed someone or cast out a demon, a lot of times, we never hear from that
person again. We don't know what came of them or how things end up, but Jesus tells us that if he
binds up the strong man, if Jesus takes over the house and cleans up the damage, that's only the first
step because the demon is going to try to return. When he does, he'll bring a few of his friends with
him. When the demon comes back, and when temptation and sin return, it will come back with a
vengeance. The point that Jesus is making here is that if they find the house unoccupied, they'll take it
back every time. Now remember, the house is us, people, and we were under the control of sin. Then
Jesus clears the sin and the demons out of our life, but we have a choice from that point forward. Are
we going to rest on our laurels and pat ourselves on the back for being clean, or are we going to live in
dependence on Jesus? If we depend on Jesus, then our houses won't be empty. If we let the Holy Spirit
fill us, then the demons won't find an unoccupied home. But if we rest on our laurels and act as if the
fight is over, we're asking for them to return, and if they return, they'll come back stronger than ever
before.
So Friends, the good news if you're here this morning and you don't know Jesus: Jesus is good. Jesus
is from God. And Jesus is stronger than any demon we face, stronger than any sin that tempts us, and if
we turn to Jesus in the time of our distress, Jesus will deliver us. But the warning that Jesus gives us
here is for everyone here that already knows Jesus: It's not enough for Jesus to set you free, and then
you get to go on with your life. If we don't keep turning to Him, if we don't keep relying on Him, if we
don't invest in our relationship with Jesus every day and every week, then that initial victory won't last
forever. The devil will once again get his grips in you.
So friends, don't let the devil take you back. Don't let sin continue to rule in any corner of your life.
Keep fighting the sin, and more importantly, let Jesus keep fighting for you. Jesus fights for us when
he leads us. Jesus fights for us when he teaches us truth. Jesus fights for us every day that we choose
to follow him. But that choice isn't a choice we make once, and then we rest on our laurels. Rather,
Jesus tells us that the battle between good and evil, the battle for the state of our souls, will continue as
long as we live.
So don't be fooled – Jesus is from God above. And don't lose hope – Jesus is stronger than any foe.
But don't, don't, don't stop fighting, because Jesus wants us to live in victory today, tomorrow, and
forever more.
Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",11/15/2015,
"As I was getting ready to write my sermon this week, Charity sent me cartoon that fit our situation
exactly. It was a picture of a pastor's wife seated in the pew holding up a giant puppet of a bunny. The
caption read, ""The pastor's wife agreed to give him a subtle reminder whenever he started to 'chase
rabbits'.” All pastors chase rabbits. We get off topic and go down rabbit trails when there's an
interesting point that doesn't quite fit, but we still want to talk about it. Of course, your pastor has now
gone on a 3 week rabbit trail. Last week, we discussed the meaning and significance of communion.
The 2 weeks prior, we dug deeply into the words and significance of the Lord's Prayer. I think these
were good rabbit trails to explore, but still, it was a big rabbit trail.
We're back in the book of Luke. The disciples had come to Jesus and asked, ""Lord, teach us to pray"".
Jesus sat them down and gave them 3 points about prayer. The first of these points was the Lord's
prayer: ""Here are the things you should pray for"", “Here are some words you can use"", ""This is an
example of what prayer ought to look like"". That's when we cut Jesus off to explore the Lord's Prayer
and Communion, right in the middle of his sentence. Today, I'd like to look at Jesus's other lessons on
prayer. There's two of them, and both of these lessons are set up the same way. First, there is an
earthly example. Then, there is a teaching that explains the point Jesus is getting at. So let's see what
Jesus says about prayer.
Our first story is the story of a man who has an unexpected visitor, and to understand the crisis that this
visitor presents, we need to remember 2 things about the culture of Bible times. First, it was what is
called a ""hospitality culture"". That is to say, if someone comes to visit you, your measure as a person is
equal to your measure as a host. So no matter who it is that visited you, you would treat them as an
honored guest. This was the time to pull out the nice china and serve your best recipes. Of course,
they didn't have fine china, and if a visitor came unexpectedly, you wouldn't have time to make any
recipes so you better hope that you had something on hand. But that brings us to the second fact about
Bible culture. They didn't have the abundance we are used to. Most of us have enough in our pantries
that we could whip together something quick, but they didn't. Making even a simple loaf of bread took
half the day, and unless they were expecting company, they only would have made enough for
themselves.
So when the visitor arrives, this man is in real trouble. He wasn't expecting the visitor so he obviously
didn't plan to have extra food. It's nighttime already, so he can't go and start the process of making
bread. He has no food to offer, and because of that, he's going insult his guest by not being hospitable
and he's going to make himself look bad in the process. So he acts on the only option he has left. He
goes to his neighbors house to beg for bread.
Now I want to tell you, I thought about trying this out this week. I wanted to set my alarm clock for
midnight and get up in the middle of the night to call unsuspecting people in the church. “Can I
borrow a cup of sugar?” I can imagine the conversations.
Maybe you'd begin to wonder why in the world is pastor baking in the middle of the night? For that
matter – who let pastor in the kitchen in the first place? Then, once the shock wore off, you might tell
me that Festival or Walmart was open 24 hours and send me there. That made me think it might be
better, more authentic, to just show up at your home, pounding on the door to wake you up, ""Can I
borrow a handful of eggs?"" How would you feel if that happened?
I'd expect you'd be frustrated – why couldn't it have waited until morning? Maybe you'd be angry that I
woke you up. That seems to be how the neighbor in this parable responded. ""What are you doing 
here??? Don't you know it's the middle of the night? I locked my door and closed my gate, don't make
me get up and let you in! Besides,my kids are already sleeping soundly,I don't want to wake them."" I
love that line. Every parent recognizes this conundrum. “Maybe if I was single, if it was just me, I'd
help you, but you want me to wake up my kids too? Don't you know that if they wake up, I won't get
them back to bed for a half hour? All this for a couple loaves of bread?”
But the truth is, if you did get a knock on the door in the middle of the night, and your pastor was
standing outside asking for a cup of sugar or a handful of eggs, chances are you'd probably give it to
me. Not because you saw the value of my baking, and not because you were particularly well disposed
to me at the moment, but just to get me to leave. Isn't that right? That, Jesus tells us, is exactly what
the neighbor did in verse 8, ""I tell you, though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is
his friend, yet because of the man's boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs.” Not
because they were friends, though they were. Not because he understood the need, though he surely
did. But because, it says, of this man's boldness.
And then Jesus does something we wouldn't expect. He compares our Father God in Heaven to this
irritated neighbor seeming to say that God, too, rewards our boldness in prayer. So it's worth asking:
“What was the boldness?”
The truth is, 'boldness' isn't a perfect translation. Other translations use different words: impudence,
persistence, and importunity. Every translation struggles to define this word right. It seems as though
the Greek word here, 'amaideian', carries a multitude of meanings. There is a boldness that comes with
waking your neighbor up in the middle of the night. There is persistence at play. (The neighbor first
refused him, but he continued to ask.) There is impudence going on - a type of desperation that comes
with knowing that you have nowhere else to turn. This is how we ought to come to God.
When we pray to God, the truth is, nobody else can supply what God supplies. We readily admit that
everything we have comes from God's hand, but there are some things that cannot come from anywhere
else. The really important stuff like life, family, and health, or peace, joy, and salvation. We have no
one else to turn to, and so we must come with desperation because only God can truly help.
We come to God with an audacious sort of boldness. Have you ever thought how ridiculous prayer is?
We're going to the God who created everything and asking him to intercede in our tiny, little lives. It's
almost audacious, but God wants us to come to him boldly. He tells us so in Hebrews 4:16, “Let us
come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace in our time of need.” I
heard it described really well recently. The only person that would dare approach a king without
hesitation is one of the kings children. Friends, we are children of the king. We need to be bold in
coming to God.
Finally, God wants us to come to him persistently. So often, I think we miss out on this one. We pray
for something, and move on with our lives. We were talking about this at growth group this week, how
important it is for us to pray and continue to pray when no answer comes. There was a pretty famous
evangelist – I won't name him - but I remember reading his advice on prayer. He said, “God is smart,
he doesn't need us to keep on coming to him with the same request. So I pray for something once and
then I move on.” I'll tell you, he may have been a good evangelist, but he wasn't a good theologian,
because the Bible tells us that we ought to continue to come to God with our requests over and over and
over again. And whether it's this story, or in James where it says the “fervent prayer of a righteous
man availeth much”, or the examples in the Old Testament of David, Jeremiah, and others who prayed
the same prayers over and over until God finally answered, God wants us to be persistent in our 
prayers. I don't know why. Maybe it's because he doesn't want us to give up hope. Maybe it's because
he knows that when we pray, we shape our hearts as well, and He's not done shaping our hearts. Or
maybe it's because when others know that we pray persistently, they take notice as well. It might be all
of them, or something else. But we know God tells us to pray persistently.
So we should come to God desperately, knowing that only God has the power to give us what we need.
We should come to God boldly, even though we don't deserve his ear, he listens to us. And we should
come to God persistently, knowing that God's answer may not come the first time, but he instructs us to
keep asking. If we pray this way – boldly, desperately, and persistently, Jesus tells us that we will
receive God's blessing. Seek – and you will find. Ask – and you will receive. Knock – and the door
will be opened to you. Because everyone who asks will receive, everyone who seeks will find, and
everyone who knocks will find an open door.
So the 1st lesson of this passage is the Lord's prayer, telling us what to pray. The 2nd lesson of this
passage directs us how to pray: with boldness, healthy desperation, and persistence. For the 3rd lesson,
Jesus again goes to an example from this world.
“Which of you Fathers”, Jesus asks, “if your son asks for a fish will give him a snake instead? Or if he
asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?” We're hard-pressed to imagine any father in the world who
would do that. Imagine, their child comes to them, hungry, asking for a piece of food. The father
doesn't simply reject the request, which we might understand. Perhaps he has no food to give. But the
father doesn't reject the request, the father recognizes the request, and instead of giving their children
something healthy to eat, he chooses to give them something that can strike them and kill them. Who
would do that? The answer is nobody. It's unthinkable.
And if such an idea is unthinkable for a human, who Jesus says – and the Bible teaches – are evil at
their very root. If evil humans are able to give good gifts to their children, and if evil humans are able
to feed their children rather than poisoning them, how much more should we expect from God, who is
by his very nature, good.
Now it's true that sometimes God doesn't always answer the way we expect Him to. There's a joke in
pastor circles that you should never pray for patience because God will answer that prayer by giving
you lots of opportunities to be patient. I've never experienced that, but I can tell you another prayer I
prayed that brought an unexpected answer.
Some years ago, I was challenged by a friend that I was too critical. I was quick to complain about
everything. Whenever something happened, I always looked on the dark side. I was your typical
Grumpy Gus, and worse, this critical attitude extended to the people in my life. I could spot someone's
faults a mile away, but if I ever saw their good side, I never mentioned it. So one day, I prayed that
God would help me to stop complaining so much, and it began the worst month of my life. I got sick.
I had car trouble. My washing machine went kaput. I don't remember everything that happened, but I
know that every day for the next month something went wrong. It wasn't anything truly disastrous , but
it was a pretty inconvenient month. When I asked God to help me stop complaining, it's like God said,
“Ok, I'll really give you something to complain about!.” Of course, at first I did complain, a lot! But
then something strange happened. I got tired of complaining. Just the energy it took to complain about
these things grew to be too much. What's more, I started to appreciate the little things, like appliances
that work, or waking up and being healthy enough to go to my job. I appreciated when my car didn't
break down on me. Suddenly I saw the blessings. 
The truth is, in the middle of that month, I felt as though I had asked for an egg, and God had given me
a scorpion. However, by the time the month was over, I understood what He was doing. I tell that
story to make this point. What are we really afraid of when we pray? Are we afraid that God is going
to give us something that isn't for our own good? Are we afraid that God is going to bring us pain for
pain's sake? If human fathers, who are evil, wouldn't do that to their children, then our Father in
heaven, who is good, wouldn't do that either.
But if we're not afraid that God is going to curse us for praying to Him, then why don't we pray more?
I think that's what Jesus is getting at. We have no good reason not to pray. God will give us all sorts of
good gifts, and only good gifts, even the greatest gift, which Jesus mentions, God gives us the Holy
Spirit to live in us, to change our lives, and to make us like God. All we need to do is pray.
In conclusion, when the disciples came to Jesus and said, “Lord, John taught his disciples to pray.
Won't you teach us how to pray?” Jesus took that question seriously. He gave an answer that still
holds true today: First, pray the Lord's Prayer. More importantly, pray the ideas that the Lord's prayer
has. Pray that God will be our Father, that he will guide us, protect us, and provide for us, and pray
that we will give him all the honor and obedience that we owe him as his children. Second, pray with
boldness, desperation, and persistence, knowing that God alone has the power to change our lives, that
God alone has the power to truly provide, and that even when God doesn't answer immediately , it's
not because He isn't listening. Thirdly (and most importantly), the greatest lesson on prayer is that we
should just do it. Pray. Because God isn't going to spite us. God isn't going to harm us. Even when he
answers our prayers in the most unexpected of ways, His gifts are always good.
So friends, heed Christ's words, and go to God in prayer. Ask – and you will receive. Seek – and you
will find. Knock – and the door will be opened unto you. Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",11/8/2015,
"Set your hope fully on the grace of Jesus Christ. I love that passage. This morning, our text is just a
jumping off passage telling us what we ought to set our minds upon. Set our minds, first, upon Jesus.
Set your minds on the grace that Jesus bestows. Set your minds on the salvation that is offered. Set
your minds on the hope that is to come.
There are many ways that we can set our minds on these blessed promises, whether by keeping them in
our conversations, or keeping them in our thoughts through prayer. We set our minds on them by
digging into the word. But today, I want to focus on one way that church helps us to set our minds on
these things. I'm talking about Communion.
I received a lot of feedback the last 2 weeks from people that appreciated going through the Lord's
Prayer, who said that they understood it better, more fully, and that they hoped to pray it with more
conviction in the future. It's a good thing to look at what we do in the church to reflect upon our rituals
and to fill them with meaning in our minds. If we don't, they become empty, and we find ourselves
going through motions without meaning. Now I hope that that's not the case with communion. Every
month, we have communion, and I believe that in those quiet moments as the music is playing and the
elements are being distributed, that we all reflect on the significance of Christ. Still, it's helpful to
reflect on the meaning.
Now often, when we talk about communion, we talk about some finer theological points. Whether it's
better to have open-table or closed-table communion, which is a discussion of who is allowed to take
communion at any given church. Or we talk about the substance of the bread and wine. Does it stay
bread or does it turn into Christ's body? But these are not what communion is about.
Today, I want to focus on 4 ideas that are central to our taking communion. Four directions that we
ought to look to fully appreciate what we do each month. Each time we take communion, it is done in
remembrance, and these are 4 of the most important truths to remember, each time we take
communion.
The first remembrance that Communion gives us, is a reminder to look back at what Jesus did. This is
probably the direction that most of us go when we reflect on the elements. We remember that Jesus
died for our sins, that his body was hung on a cross until he breathed his last breath, that Jesus bled out
of his head, his hand, his back, and his feet. And even though He could have stopped it, He didn't. He
went to the cross because He loves us. He gave up his life because without him, we would have no
hope. That's good, because Jesus going to the cross is the central idea of communion. If we miss that,
we miss everything.
Yet really, as we look back to what Jesus did, we need to look back further to truly understand it. The
Last Supper was a Passover meal. All throughout the Old Testament (remember, that's the whole Bible
that Jesus and the disciples had), this act is spoken of as God's greatest proof of his love, protection,
and power. Passover is when God delivered Israel out of slavery in Egypt. I'm sure you remember the
story. God called Moses to lead Israel out of Egypt, but Pharoah didn't want to let them go. So there
was a problem and the way that God – through Moses – convinced Pharoah to let Israel leave, was
through a bunch of curses. There were 10 plagues that God brought on Egypt. First, God turned the
Nile River, the source of life, into blood. Second, He brought a massive infestation of frogs. When
that didnt' work, he infested the people and the animals with lice. Then God brought insects, then
diseases, boils among the animals. Still, Pharoah wouldn't listen. So God brought thunderstorms and
hail. Locusts ate their crops. He covered the land in darkness for 3 days straight, and still Pharaoh 
wouldn't budge. So God brought a 10th plague, the worst of them all. The first child in every family
(the firstborn of every animal, too) would die in one horrific night, unless...
God gave the Israelites a way to avoid this horrific plague of death. They were to take a lamb and
sacrifice it to God. The meat from the sacrificial lamb was for them to eat as their last meal in Egypt.
The blood from the sacrificial lamb was for them to paint over their door frames. Then, in the middle
of the night, when the angel of death came to do the deed, he would see the blood of the lamb on the
doorposts, and he would pass over that house. That's where the name, Passover, comes from, because
God's angel passed over the houses if they were covered by the blood.
Now fast foward 1400 years. One thousand, four hundred times that the Passover supper had been
repeated, reminding them to look back and remember God's deliverance. Now Jesus and the disciples
sit down to the table and already at the forefront of each of their minds is the truth that if your house
was covered in the blood of the lamb, you would be spared God's judgment and death. Then Jesus,
who would come to be called the Lamb of God, began to speak about his own death. He was going to
die, and soon. His body would be broken that we might be healed. His blood would be shed for the
forgivenness of our sins. And if we believe in Jesus, if we put our hope and our trust in Him, then we
are covered by the blood of God's lamb, and we are spared God's judgment and eternal death in Hell.
It's no accident that the Last Supper was a Passover meal because it tells us exactly what Jesus did.
Jesus died so that we could have new life. Jesus shed blood so that we could be forgiven, and anyone
who takes of the bread and the cup and trusts in Jesus as their savior is forgiven and healed and God's
judgment at the end of the world will pass over them. So let's first remember to look back – to what
Jesus – the lamb of God did: He spared us of death and he set us free from our slavery to sin when He
sacrificed himself for his chosen people, us.
The 2nd remembrance is to look inside us, because we also take communion in remembrance of our new
status. It's not just that we were saved by Christ's death. That's an important and vital point, but it's not
the only point. Yes, we are saved, but it is so much more than that. We are changed from the inside
out. When Jesus was ministering on earth, he once preached, ""I am the bread of life, and unless you
eat my flesh and drink my blood, you will not have life."" We might be tempted to say, ""Well, Jesus was
speaking in metaphor. He didn't really mean we had to eat his body. Even the wafers and the wine
aren't really his body and blood.” I believe that that's true. Jesus was using a metaphor, but it was a
weird metaphor to use. Why, of all the ways he could say it, did he choose one so cryptic
and so dark? He was getting at a bigger point. When we consume food, it becomes a part of us. The
protein becomes muscle, the sweets go to the hips, but either way, something outside of us has become
part of us when we eat it. This is one picture of how Jesus changes our lives.
In the church, we are fond of saying, ""Jesus lives in our hearts"". We know Jesus isn't there pumping
blood, but still, we keep going to that idea because the heart is where all our emotions, all our
motivations, all the things that are deepest and dearest to us. So we place things in our heart, saying
lines like, “I know it by heart”, “I love her with all my heart”, and “My hearts desire is...”
How does Jesus live in our hearts? Though he is outside of us, we decide to follow Jesus. We put our
trust in Him, and we follow Him. The more we get to know Him, the more we become like Him, and
as we grow in Him, we become his body. In very much the same way that when we eat food, it
becomes part of us, when we follow Jesus, He becomes part of us. More importantly, we become part
of Him. We are united at the deepest level we can imagine. So deeply intwined that the only way to
get close to picturing it is the idea of eating, metabolizing, and growing. 
But that's not the only change we experience. Yes, we are changed from the inside out so that we desire
to please God, so that we take joy in serving Him rather than serving ourselves, so that we pursue
holiness with all of our – well – heart. But we also experience a change in status. ""This is a new
covenant"", Jesus says, ""in my blood.""
I've often said that covenant is a fancy word for promise, which is true, but it goes deeper than that.
See, a covenant, and especially the covenant between God and man through Jesus, carries 2 ideas. The
first idea is that there is something legally binding. It is not based in the wishy-washiness of emotions.
It's not even based in the fleeting nature of ones words. It's like a contract, once the names are signed
and the notary seal affixed, even if you don't like it anymore, you're stuck with it. And like a contract,
God's promise to care for Jesus's followers has been sealed in the blood of Jesus and further sealed by
the gift of the Holy Spirit who resides in us. It's a promise that cannot be revoked. But there's a 2nd
idea to the covenant Jesus references. It is a contract born out of love. It is more than a legal contract
because it is also backed up by God's love for us. It's not that he's obligated (allthough by His own
choosing, He is), but even were He not obligated, He still would choose to because He loves us.
The best example we have of this is the marriage ceremony. Promises are made at every wedding, we
call them vows. Once the marriage certificate is signed and sent in, it is legally binding. Should you
wake up one day no longer in love with your spouse, you're still married. You can't undo it simply by
changing your mind, and yes, it's much more than a legal matter. If all you had was legal status, it
wouldn't be much of a marriage at all. What makes it a marriage is the love and devotion and
commitment that two people share. So a covenant is richer and deeper than a contract, but more fixed
and binding that mere promised words. That is the new covenant we experience: richer and deeper
than a legal matter, but more fixed and binding that words. We are in a covenant with God through
Jesus Christ.
And you know, that's an important point. It's not our doing. It's Jesus's doing that changed it all. We
know this, but here's something you may not realize. When the Protestants broke away from the
Catholic church they changed the method of communion to symbolize this fact. In the Catholic
Church, you stand up and go to the front, but in Protestant Churches, typically, the elements are
brought to you. There's a purpose for this. The Reformers wanted to emphasize that God's grace is
truly free. We do nothing to earn it. It is a gift of God. So when we re-enact this theology in
communion, we have you stay seated, so that the love and grace of God come to you without any work
to receive it. Did you know that's why we do it this way? It's not because it's faster or easier, but
because we recognize that salvation comes from Jesus and not from ourselves or our good deeds.
A 3rd direction we remember to look is around us. I said earlier that when we take the communion, we
become part of the body of Christ. You know who else is part of the body of Christ? Everyone else
who is taking communion, everyone else who believes in Jesus. That is the reason that we take the
elements together. We hold onto them until everyone is served, and then we all eat the bread or drink
the wine at the same time. We do this to remind ourselves that as people of the new covenant – God's
New Testament Chosen - we are not in this alone. We are united with Christ, as deep as eating unites
us with food, but we are united with one another just as deeply. Paul goes to this idea again and again.
We are united – one body, one faith, one Christ – so the church body ought never to hate or sin against
one another. Now sometimes we do, because we're not perfect, but we need to see that these are our
brothers and our sisters. We are part of the same family. We are even part of the same body. Because
the very moment that unites us to Christ, also unites us to one another. We take communion as a
community. We take Christ's body, as a body. Remember to look around you in love.
Finally, there is a 4th direction, and I'll just touch on it briefly. Communion is also a reminder for us to
look forward. Every month, when I recite what Jesus said at the last supper, I rarely go through
everything that Jesus said. It's actually a narrow slice of a larger episode. One line that Jesus said, and
is present in Matthew, Mark, and Luke, but often gets left out is this: Before Jesus hands out the bread
and lifts the cup, at the beginning of the meal, he passes out the wine, and says, ""I tell you the truth, I
will not again drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes."" In fact, later on, Jesus is
offered wine on the cross, and he refuses it.
This passage tells us that we will once again drink with Jesus. Jesus here is promising his return when
the kingdom of God comes in full, when God's kingdom comes on earth, Jesus will be there with all of
his followers. With you and with me, Jesus will sit down again to eat and drink wine. This scene is
described in Revelation as the Marriage Supper of the Lamb, when the Lamb of God is the groom and
the Church is his bride, and we all come together for a wonderful feast. When we take communion, we
remember that Jesus has promised to return. As sure as he died for our sins, and as sure as he's given
us new lives in this lifetime, so also we can be sure that Jesus will return and we will be with him
celebrating in heaven.
Friends, Communion is a wonderful tradition, but it is more than that. It stands as a reminder for us to
look at Jesus, and remember all that Jesus's sacrifice means. We remember to look back to when a
human man became the sacrificial lamb of God, shedding his blood that we might be set free from our
slavery to sin and to death and covering us with his blood so that we can be assured of escaping death
and hell.
We remember to look inside of us, knowing that we have been changed from the inside-out. We
remember that Jesus has become as much a part of our spiritual selves, as our food becomes a part of
our physical selves. And we remember that we have received a new covenant, a promise that is binding
and a promise made in love. We will have new lives, and will remain in God's love and his favor
forever, not because of anything we did to warrant it, not because of any merit we bring, but as a free
gift, brought to us where we were. Just as the elements are brought to our seat.
We remember to look around us. Communion reminds us that the very same act that unites us with
Christ also unites us to the rest of Christ's body. We've become one with each other, becoming one
through Christ Jesus.
And we remember to look forward to that great and glorious day when Jesus returns, ushering in the
Kingdom of God in all of it's fullness. We wait to sit at the marriage supper of the lamb to once again
drink wine with Jesus and enjoy sweet fellowship with Jesus in the flesh...
Jesus said, ""Do this in remembrance of me"". As we now prepare for the Lord's table, let us look
backward to Christ's sacrifice. Let us look inward to Christ's accomplished work. Let us look around
and appreciate the body of Christ. And let us look forward to the glorious return of Christ – our Lord
and our Savior.
Let us pray....",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",11/1/2015,
"Let me ask you a question? Are you tired this morning? Raise your hands if it's been a long week for
you. This week is always a tiring week, but what a better week to talk about prayer?
We're continuing our 2 part series on the Lord's prayer. If you weren't here last week, here are some of
the highlights: I love the Lord's Prayer, and I hate the Lord's prayer. I love it because it's beautiful, it's
the words of Jesus, it's how He teaches us to pray, and it's a prayer that resides deep in our hearts. But I
hate it because it's just so easy to say without meaning it, to say the words without praying at all.
We've probably all done that, maybe even this morning. That's why it's so important that we take the
time to really think about what we're saying, because the better we understand what this prayer is about
The more we can mean it when we pray it.
Now prayer is talking to God. That's all there is to it. So it shouldn't surprise us that the conversation
we have with God is about 2 things: us and God. Last week, we looked at the part of the Lord's prayer
that is centered around God. It told us who God is: He is our Father in Heaven. It told us how we
ought to think of Him: May your reputation (your name) be holy (hallowed). 'Hallowed by thy name'
means, ""May we always remember that you are holy."" And it told us what God was doing: ""Your
Kingdom Come"", which means ""May your future kingdom come so that everyone on earth will do your
will, just as the angels do in heaven, and may your present kingdom rule over our hearts, so that we
will do your will, just as it's done in heaven.
So far, in this prayer, it is centered on God. Yes, it includes us in the equation: What we call God, what
we ought to think about God, how we can join in the mission of God, but it's primary focus is God.
It's about to change. In this conversation between us and God – we first, rightly, talked about God.
Now, Jesus is showing us how to pray for us. We need that. Left to my own devices, my prayers
would be all sorts of messed up. ""God let me win the lottery."" ""Bless all my friends with Corvette
convertables."" ""Send lightning to those people that made me mad. ""Save all the puppies, but kill all
the spiders."" I dunno...I've heard some awful selfish prayers over the years. I've said some too, so it's
good that Jesus teaches us how we ought to pray about our lives.
But this, too, goes back to who God is. Our Father, who art in Heaven. If you weren't here last week, I
said that a good father did 3 things: he provides, he protects, and he guides. Now in the Lord's Prayer,
we have 3 requests and guess what they are: ""Dear God – Provide, Protect, and Guide me.""
And I'd like to look, briefly, at each of these requests. First, God, please provide for me: Give us this
day our daily bread. I love that phrase – daily bread, because it isn't 'give me enough groceries for the
week, or the month'. It's 'give me enough food to make it through today'. There's a big difference
between these 2 ideas, because when we pray only for today, we're promising that we'll be trusting God
tomorrow as well. It's saying, ""I don't need to worry about tomorrow because God is my provider, and
he'll be there tomorrow, too."" It reminds us of Manna in the desert, when Moses and Israel were
heading into the Promised Land, and each morning, bread from heaven would appear on the ground.
Everyone needed to take enough for just 1 day, and anything left over would rot, because God wanted
them to trust Him for their daily bread.
We need to remember also, however, that daily bread is a need, not a want. Yes, sometimes God
blesses us with what we want, but God only promises to provide our needs. I think we have a tough
time with that. Our needs are usually met. Think about the last thing you really wishing you could
buy. Was it a want or a need? Chances are, it was a want.
One of my favorite hashtags is the ""firstworldproblems"" hashtag. Now if that didn't make any sense to
you, let me explain. A hashtag is an internet way of grouping similar ideas together using the ""pound""
symbol, so when people on facebook or twitter want to add to a particular conversation, they use this
'hashtag' to do it. One of these 'hashtags' is called ""Firstworldproblems"". It's for when you have
something you want to complain about, but as you're making the complaint, you realize that 90% of the
world would think this is a ridiculous problem to have. Here are some of my favorites, you'll get the
idea:
• ""I have a deep and profound craving for mushroom risotto, but the grocery store is out of the
right rice.""
• ""What's the point of putting wifi in the plane if it's not fast enough to stream Netflix?""
• ""I found a cute top today, so I bought it, only to realize I already had it in the back of my closet.
So annoying!""
• ""My Panera rapid pickup wasn't ready when I got there. It cost me an extra 3 minutes. Now
I'll be 3 minutes late all day!""
• ""Having the new iphone when you've run out of data is 10 times worse than no iphone at all""
First world problems. Father – Give us today our daily bread.
Next, we ask our Father in heaven to protect us. Last week, I gave Old Testament examples of
protection: ""Protect us from an enemy army."", ""Protect me from people who want to kill me and
become King of Israel."" But Jesus knows that the danger of death isn't the greatest danger we face.
When he teaches us how to pray to God for protection, it goes like this, ""Forgive me my debts, as I
forgive my debtors."" Forgive me my sins, because death is a small problem compared to Hell, and
swords are a small problem compared to sin.
The truth is all of us sin. I don't say that to minimize sin, but to point out that all of us have a big
problem in our life because the Bible says that anyone who has sin – present or past – cannot have any
fellowship with a Holy God. This means, that when God (""Hallowed be His name"") comes to earth
(""Thy Kindgom Come""), we don't get to be there. Not unless our sins are forgiven. I'd rather be killed
in this world and go to heaven than live a long life in this world, and be cast out of heaven forever.
Wouldn't you? So forgive us our sins.
But I hate that caveat: as we forgive our debtors. It scares me. In Matthew's gospel, the Lord's Prayer
is immediately followed by a parable that makes it clear that unless we forgive those who sin against
us, we won't be forgiven by God. I don't know how far to take the parable. I don't think we earn our
salvation by forgiving others, but it does seem to be saying that if we understand how much we have
been forgiven, then we easily ought to forgive less serious offenses. And if we don't forgive our
debtors, then maybe we really haven't experienced God's forgivenness for whatever reason. That is
scary.
But it's also a form of protection – the fact that we should forgive others. Have you ever met someone
who's held onto a grudge for years or even decades? Long after the offender is gone, they're still upset
about the offense. What sort of peace do they have in their life? What sort of joy? What sort of
outlook does that create about life? Just as God protects us from the consequence of our own sin,
forgiving us and keeping us from hell, I believe God protects us from the consequence of other people's
sin by teaching us to forgive others and sparing us of a life of heartache and bitterness.
So we have God our Father. He provides for us by giving us our daily bread. He protects us by
forgiving us and reminding us to forgive others. The 3rd aspect of a good father is that he guides us,
and that's exactly what we find next in the prayer. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Now we know that temptation leads to evil. That's kind of the definition of temptation, isn't it? But
what we don't always realize is that temptation is like gravity. With gravity, the closer you get to the
center of mass, the stronger the pull is. Now it's not really noticeable here on earth. Climbing a
mountain doesn't get easier the higher you get, it's not a big enough difference. But if you could get up
really, really high, Earth's gravity wouldn't be able to pull you down anymore. We see this when
astronauts go into space. They get far enough away from earth and they are weightless. Temptation
works in the same way.
Let's say, hypothetically, that you struggle in the area of alcohol and any time you get 1 drink in your
hand, you end up having 20. Where is going to be safer for you, a church, or a bar? Or let's say that
your issue is gossipping, when others start, you can't help but join in. Doesn't that mean you should
stay away from other gossipers?
A lot of times, we treat areas of sin and temptation as measures of our spiritual strength. We say, ""I'm a
strong Christian, so I can watch horror movies or sex scenes and still keep my mind pure."" Or we say,
""I'm a strong Christian, so I can go partying til 2 in the morning and never fall into drunkenness or
debauchery"". Or maybe, ""I'm a strong Christian, so I can surround myself with people who cuss all day
long, but I'll never pick up the habit"". Who knows, maybe you can, but most people I've seen try, have
failed. The force gets too strong. Temptation pulls you in. Which is why Jesus says that avoiding sin
is about staying away from temptation altogether - Lead me not into temptation – lest I be led into evil.
But then Jesus goes on, ""...and by the way God, if I'm already in evil, if I'm already in the clutches of
sin, and I can't – or won't – leave of my own volition, then by all means necessary - Deliver me from
evil.
It's a two-fold prayer for guidance that goes something like this: ""God, keep me far away from evil,
don't even let me take the first step into temptation, but if I'm already there, get me out quick!""
Whether we are near or far from evil, we are asking God to guide our steps away.
So what happens when we put it altogether, last week and this week? What Jesus has done is painted
us a picture of the perfect relationship between a father and a child, between our heavenly Father and
us, his beloved children. We pray that he would do all the things a good Father does: Provide for me –
give us this day, our daily bread, protect me – Forgive me of my sins, and help me to forgive others, and
guide me – Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil. And in return, we as the children
will honor our father – Hallowed be thy name, and obey our father – Thy will be done.
Friends, there's one more line to consider, the doxology or the final line: Thine is the Kingdom, the
Power, and the Glory forever, Amen. It's a tricky one, because Jesus probably never taught it. If you
use the pew Bible or any other modern translation, you won't find it in there. You will find it in older
versions like the King James, because as far as we can tell, it was added in later, around the year 700 or
800. When they translated the King James, they didn't have an copies older than the year 800. So we
recite it, partly out of tradition, and partly because it's an excellent reflection on the prayer we just
prayed. You'll remember that all of Jesus's teaching was about the Kingdom of God, and while this
prayer is a perfect summary of the relationship between a child and a loving father, it can also be a
description of the relationship between a loving king and his subjects. The same truths hold true.
King in heaven, provide, protect, and guide us, and we as your people will honor and obey. But if
we're honest, we don't honor and obey God on our own. None of us are so good that we obey God out
of our own strength. None of us are so humble that we honor God above ourselves on our own. We
only do it because Jesus taught us how to. We only do it because God loved us first. We only do it
because we're filled with God's spirit that teaches us how to. So whether it's God's jobs (to provide,
protect and to guide) or our jobs (to honor and obey God), the power by which this is done is the same.
It's God's power. And if we accept that is true, we know we shouldn't be getting the credit for being so
good or so humble. It's God who changed us from the inside out, so it's God who gets the credit. That
is what that line is saying. For thine – yours – is the kingdom. It's done by your power, and it's done
for your glory. We're just happy to be along for the ride
So friends, let us pray the Lord's prayer boldly and confidently. And let us remember that this prayer
defines our relationship with God. He provides all that we need to live. He protects us from the harsh
consequence of sin. He guides our steps to keep us from sin and from evil. We, in return, through
God's own power to change hearts, we honor and obey him like good children should.
As we close in prayer today, I'd like to close differently. We've studied the Lord's prayer, so let us say it
again together, this time, being sure that we think about what this prayer means and thanking God for
the relationship we have with him. Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",10/25/2015,
"The Lord's Prayer. I've been looking forward to this passage ever since I began our series in Luke,
because it is so important in the life of the believer. If I'm honest, however, I have a love-hate
relationship with the Lord's prayer. I love it – because it's a wonderful prayer, and a wonderful
example of how we ought to pray. But I hate it – because it's so easy to say the words without meaning
them.
Have you ever done that? I know I have. Before I was a pastor, I would be at church and my mind
would drift off as the pastor is praying, suddenly the Lord's prayer would begin and I would recite the
words without thinking about them. Even as a pastor, I hate to admit, sometimes I'm thinking about
what's coming next. What's the next song? What's the children's message? I try not to, but sometimes
I do. Just in case, I even have the words of the Lord's prayer written out every week on my praise and
request sheet. Because it's happened that I'm just saying the words, and it keeps me from losing my
place. Awful, isn't it?
The truth is, I grew up in a church where we didn't say the Lord's Prayer every week. I was taught that
it was a good example of the things we should include in our own prayers, but that we missed the point
if all we did was recite those same words over and over again. I still believe that that's true. The Lord's
Prayer is more a guideline for our prayers than a prayer to be repeated, but I've come to value the act of
repeating it each week. Let me tell you what changed my mind.
It was the day after Margie Rohrer had her stroke. In the days following her stroke, she wasn't fully
aware of what was going on, in fact, she was really out of it. I would visit, and she wouldn't even
remember I was there. I don't know what compelled me, but when I prayed with her, I ended my
prayer with the Lord's Prayer. And though she didn't recognize me, and though I'm not sure she heard
or understood the words I was praying, when I started reciting that Lord's Prayer holding her hand, she
started mouthing the words along with me. Soon, she started speaking the words with her slurred
speech, but I knew that her heart had gone to prayer. As we finished praying that prayer together, she
was more peaceful than when I had come. Suddenly, I realized the value of having a prayer so
embedded on our hearts that even when our brains are struggling to make sense of anything, and our
minds are at a loss of what to say, even in those moments, we are able to pray.
Saying the Lord's Prayer every week is a good thing. It commits God's Word to our minds, and it
anchors prayer to our hearts so that in the moments where we really need it, it's there. But the danger is
still there, that once we have learned the words, it is all too easy to say those words without thinking
about the meaning. We take our very powerful and intimate prayers with God, and replace them with
an empty shell of memorized words. The only way to remedy this travesty is to dig into what these
words mean, so that not only do we know the words by heart, we also know the ideas they posses. That
way, when we pray the Lord's prayer, we can mean what we're saying.
Now you may notice that the Lord's Prayer here in Luke is a little bit different than the one we're used
to reciting. It says, your kingdom come, but not thy will be done. It says lead us not into temptation,
but it skips deliver us from evil. We don't know why this is. Sometimes the way Luke and Matthew
recount Jesus's teachings is different, but here, the difference is helpful. Luke just hits the dominant
clauses. The ones that aren't in Luke's gospel , they're all subordinate clauses, explaining the meaning
of the first. It actually helps us to understand the prayer. For our purposes today, I'm not going to teach
directly from Luke's presentation of the Lord's Prayer. I'm going to consider the text that we know,
which is from Matthew's gospel, and includes the doxology – the final line, for thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory.
That way, when we recite the Lord's Prayer each week, we can be mindful of all that it has to offer. It's
too much to go through in just a week, so we're going to break it up. \We're going to take 2 weeks to go
through it, and the way we're going to break it up is this: The first part is ""God-centric"". It's all about
God's relationship with this world. The second part, which we'll look at next week, is ""People-centric"".
It's the prayers for God to act on our behalves individually. So with that long introduction to the Lord's
Prayer – let's look at what it actually says.
Our Father, Who Art in Heaven. This is the address, it tells us who we are praying to. It tells us that
we are praying to someone above us. They are in heaven, a stark contrast to the world full of earthly
idols. Our God exists on another plane, in a place that we cannot ever achieve in this life. He is high
and lifted up. There is a sense in which referring to God as our Father reminds us that he is high and
lifted up as well, like children who look up to their father's as the strongest man we know, we know that
God is more mighty than the others who claim to be gods, and more mighty, even , than our earthly
fathers.
But the word, 'Father' tells us more than just, ""God is bigger than you."" 'Father' is a relationship word,
which makes this term more meaningful. I've often said, and I say every year at Father's Day, that
earthly fathers shape how their children understand God. Impatient fathers lead children to see God as
impatient. Harsh fathers lead children to see God as harsh. In Philadelphia, where absent fathers
abounded, it was hard for kids to believe that their heavenly father wouldn't abandon them sooner or
later as well. (to the point where I almost didn't want to call God 'Father'). But a good father does 3
things that reflect what our heavenly father does.
First, they are providers. Our Father in Heaven is the ultimate provider. It starts with him giving us
life. He lets us be born into families who love us and nurture us. He provides for us physically by
giving us food, and he provides for us spiritually, by providing His only begotten Son as a sacrifice for
our sins. But he is not merely a provider.
God is a protector. How often do we find this image in Scripture? In the histories, when God's people
are attacked by foreign armies, God protects them. In the Psalms, when God's servant is attacked by
usurpers of the throne, he protects David. In fact, you would be hard-pressed to find a single page in
your Bible that doesn't talk about God's protection. He is the rock of ages. He's our mighty battle
shield. He's our strong defender. He protects us.
And God is a guide. Like a father who teaches his child to walk, God teaches us to walk in paths of
righteousness. Like a father who teaches his child the skills to live, God teaches us how to live wisely.
If God were not guiding us – imagine how much trouble we'd encounter.
So God is our heavenly Father, high and lifted up, yet caring enough about each of us to provide,
protect and to guide.
Our next clause is Hallowed Be Thy Name. I think that this might be one of the more confusing parts
for one simple reason: try to use ""hallowed"" in a sentence. In all the English language that most of us
use on a daily basis, there's only one word that even comes close, and it's coming in about 2 weeks:
Halloween. But even that word, Halloween, doesn't necessarily help us. What does Halloween have to
do with the Hallowed name of God? Well, here's the connection. Halloween is an old fashioned way
of saying, ""All Hallow's Eve"", which means, the day before ""All Hallow's Day"". If you're not familiar
with All Hallow's Day, you're not alone. All Hallow's Day, as it's known in the Catholic Church
Is All Saint's Day, the day that we celebrate each and every saint – or hallowed one.
The word ""Hallow"" means ""Holy"". The word ""Saints"", too, means ""the Holy Ones"". So when we say,
""Hallowed by thy name"", what we mean, in clear English, is ""May your name be Holy"". That shouldn't
be hard. We know that God is always holy. So it is natural that his name would be holy. Yet we live in
a world where God's name is more frequently in vain. When most of the word talks about God or
Jesus, it's usually when they're surprised or injured or just upset. They take God's name in vain. If
we're honest, we might actually do this too sometimes. But God's name is supposed to be Holy, and
recognized as Holy. So that's the first petition of this prayer – that everyone, including ourselves
would respect his name as holy.
It's deeper than that though. If you read through the Old Testament, we find lots of examples where
God does something amazing, whether it's deliver Israel out of Egypt, or help them conquer the
promised land, or help them repel the Assyrian forces, and it says that the reason God does this is,
quote, ""For my name's sake."" We even see this in the most famous Psalm, Psalm 23: ""He leadeth me
in the paths of righteousness...(why?)...For his name's sake.""
God's name is more than just the word God, or Elohim, or Yahweh. God's name is another way of
saying, 'God's reputation'. So we're not just praying that we, and others, would stop taking his name in
vain, but that the holiness of God would be his reputation. We're praying that everybody on earth
would acknowledge that God is Holy. There is only 1 God, singularly unique and perfect, and the God
of the Bible is that one true God, set apart, holy, in a fallen world. Hallowed be thy name – may
everybody recognize your holiness.
So here, with these first 2 lines, we discover 2 of the most important thoughts about God. First, He is
our Father and though he is above us, He is intimate with us, cares for us, he provides, protects, and
guides us. Second, He is holy. May everyone, and especially ourselves, recognize God's awesome
holiness. There's a 3rd clause in this first half, and this is the longest.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. It was nearly 2 years ago that I did a
series on the Kingdom of God. I'd like to think that all of you remember this series perfectly, but for
those that may not remember, or those who weren't here when that series was going on, here's the truth
about Jesus's teaching: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE KINGDOM OF GOD. If there's one dominant idea in
the gospels, it's that Jesus was teaching about the kingdom: what the kingdom is like, what it means to
be part of the kingdom, but most importantly, that God's Kingdom was at hand. (Now if you don't
remember that series, that's ok. As we continue through Luke, this will be a recurring theme, and even
so far, we've seen that Jesus is regularly teaching about the Kingdom.)
It's hard for us, as Americans, to understand, because we don't have a king. We have a ruling class in
Washington, but they can be kicked out every 2, 4, or 6 years if we so decide. Even the royalty we're
familiar with is a figurehead royalty. The Queen of England makes appearances, but she doesn't rule
the country. Kings in Bible times were different. They had absolute control. They made the rules and
the people had to follow them. The closest we have in this day and age is a dictator or a despot, which
is usually a bad thing. Most kings in Israel's times were bad as well. They used their power to grow
rich off the people's labor. They weren't always fair. The rich and connected were given extra benefits,
and if you were poor, you were usually out of luck. But God promised a kingdom where He was king,
and because God is just, justice would reign supreme. Because God is loving, the people would benefit
from his rule. Jesus came to earth to tell us, ""The Kingdom of God is coming.""
Now we might think, and rightly so, that God's Kingdom is a future event. There will come a time
where Jesus returns, and the everlasting kingdom with God on the throne will be in place. Friends, 
that's as good as it gets. What will it look like? The 2nd line tells us what it will look like. I said earlier
that Luke's account leaves out the subordinate clauses, which tell us that this 2nd line is a subordinate
clause. It clarifies and explains the primary clause:
God's will will be done on earth, just as it is in heaven. If we look to the heavenly order, God already
reigns supreme. He gives instructions to the angels, and they obey. When God's kingdom comes on
earth in all it's fullness, the only people left will be the ones who want to serve Him, and God's will will
be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
But here's the secret, while it's true that God's full kingdom is a future event, when Jesus said that God's
kingdom was close at hand, He wasn't lying. Though God's kingdom doesn't yet cover the whole earth,
it's possible for God's kingdom to be alive and well in our hearts. And how do we know that we are in
God's kingdom? If we follow and obey His will. God speaks – and the angels obey – in heaven. God
speaks – and the Christians obey – on earth.
And so with this line, we are praying two things. First, that God's kingdom would not tarry long, that
Jesus would return and God would establish his worldwide rule. More importantly, we are praying that
we would be members of God's Kingdom, that we would do God's will on earth, just as it's done in
heaven.
So where does that leave us? Friends, as we look to the Lord's Prayer, we remember that the first part
of it focuses on the relationship between God and the world. We are praying that God would set his
world aright. May He be our father, providing for us, protecting us, and guiding us in the way to go.
We pray that God's name would be hallowed, that everyone would acknowledge that God's name was
holy, and more importantly, that God's reputation as the one-and-only, amazing, holy God would be
known throughout the world. And we pray that God's kingdom would arrive soon, so that every knee
would bow and every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord, and that God's rules and decrees – God's will –
would be done on earth as it's done in heaven. We pray this not only for the world, it's a prayer for us
as well. Because even as Christians, we are inclined to lose sight of the truth. We get caught up in the
worldly ways, and forget God's heavenly ways. So it's a prayer that each and every one of us ought to
remember and make true in our own hearts.
God is your father – He loves you and cares for you. God is Holy – His ways are not our natural ways,
but His ways are right. And we pray that we would live in God's kingdom even before it arrives in this
world. We pray that God's will would rule over our hearts and our minds in Christ.

"Last week, we looked at the story of the Good Samaritan, and one of the key principles to
understanding the story was that the priest and the Levite were following the Jewish cleanliness laws to
a tee. But Jesus used the parable of the Good Samaritan to demonstrate that while they were following
God's levitical law, Jesus's law was greater. In fact, the cleanliness law kept the priest and the Levite
from following the greater command: Love God and love your neighbor.
This week, we see a similar battle at play. There are social customs and social norms that
dictate any society. These social norms can actually rise up to be laws in themselves. They are the
rules, or laws, of etiquette, and while all of us prefer to be polite, there are times when Jesus trumps the
laws of etiquette The story of Mary and Martha is one of those instances.
The story of Martha and Mary is a simple one. Jesus and his disciples came to the house of
Martha and Mary. We know that Jesus was friends with their brother Lazarus, and cared a great deal
for Mary and Martha, so it's no surprise that when Jesus came to town He would visit the home of
Lazarus, Martha, and Mary. Of course, as Jesus's popularity grew, those visits became more and more
complex. Jesus would bring along his disciples, and then there were other followers. Suddenly this
family went from hosting Jesus and a few friends to bring called on to host large parties of people for
their friend, Jesus.
Now if you've ever been responsible for hosting people in your home, there are 2 ways you can
go about it. The 1st way is called a ""type-A"" approach, where you want to have everything perfect.
The hostess with the mostest. The 2nd way is a little more laid back. We might call this, the ""lived in""
approach, where you try to make it as nice as possible, but not at the expense of driving yourself crazy.
And I suspect that Mary and Martha had different attitudes about hosting. Martha – we might suppose
– cared a great deal about doing it right. The rules of etiquette dictated that the job she did hosting
was a reflection of how much she valued Jesus, and as someone who cared a great deal and loved the
Lord, she invested considerable energy to make it a great event. Mary – on the other hand – was a little
more ""type-B"". As long as people have a place to sit and maybe a little food they ought to be happy.
After all, this isn't a restaurant. They're not paying for the service. It's decent, and that's good enough.
In one instance, Martha turns to Jesus and complains about the amount of work that has to be
done and the fact that Mary isn't doing her fair share. She surely expected Jesus to agree with her, to
tell Mary, ""Hey, get off your rear and help your sister out."" But he didn't. Instead of calling Mary out,
Jesus told Martha, ""Hey, you need to chill.""
And with that, centuries of conflict got started between the natural ""Marys"" and the natural
""Marthas"". It's also an internal conflict. Marthas know they need to spend more time focusing on
Jesus, and the Marys know that stuff still needs to get done. In fact, this struggle was epitomized by a
Bible Study that our Ladies Sunday School did where they went through a book called, Having a Mary
Heart in a Martha World. The struggle is real.
But I think we misunderstand the text if it's left just as a struggle between the Mary's and the
Martha's. First, because when we talk about it in that context, it's as if we relegate this passage to
pertain only to women. I've heard countless women say, ""I'm more a Mary, or I'm more a Martha"", and
all Christian women know what that means. I've never heard, however, a guy say, ""I'm a Martha"", have
you? (Although if you ask our wives, men, they'd probably say we're all Mary's, and not in the good
way.) More importantly, though, as long as we pit this as a battle between the Marthas and the Marys,
between the devoted and the dutiful, we're actually missing a lot of the point. This story is a story of
priorities, and it's a story of focus. What is the focus of our attention? What is the priority of our time?
There are 3 choices we have in every moment in our life, and like many of our choices, the
struggle of our priorities aren't always between the good and the bad. Sometimes it's between the good
and the best. So let's go through the 3 priorities presented in the text, and consider the good, the bad,
and the best.
The best priority is indeed the one that Mary chose – Looking to Jesus. Jesus said as much
when he said, ""Mary has chosen which is better, and it will not be taken away from her."" Now if you
remember last week, this whole section started with Jesus giving 3 teachings. The first was that God is
revealed not to the learned, like our expert in the law, but to the children and the childlike. I said the
other 2 lessons tied in line with this story.
Jesus said, ""All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is
except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son
chooses to reveal him.” In confirmation class, we're studying the ways that God reveals himself.
There are 2 types of Revelation when we are looking to find out about God. The first is called General
Revelation, and it includes a wide variety of sources: creation, the laws of nature, morality that is
written on our hearts. All of these things reveal truths about God and they are available to every man,
woman, and child, no matter what they believe, it's widely available. But it's limited in what it teaches.
Nature tells us that a creator God exists, but tells us nothing about how he created or what he's like.
Our morality tells us that God is a moral God, but if our morality is messed up by sin, we are hopeless
to understand his morality.
The other type is Special Revelation. Special Revelation is more limited in its scope, but more
detailed in what it teaches. There are 2 areas we find Special Revelation. The first is through God's
Word – the Bible. Everything it tells us is true about God, but it doesn't cover every circumstance.
And you know as well as I do, there's a lot of interpretation that goes into properly understanding the
Bible. So the best and fullest mode of Special Revelation is in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ.
Jesus shows us so many things about God. From his birth, we know that God loved us enough
to send his Son, and we know that God understands us, because he dwelt here on earth. From Christ's
life, we see what it looks like to live perfectly obedient lives, what it looks like to be holy as God is
holy, and we are given an example to follow for every situation in life. From Christ's teaching, we are
told all sorts of truths about God, us, and the world we inhabit: that we are sinners, that God is holy,
how it is that we can please God, and the challenges we will face. From Christ's miracles, we are
shown glimpses of heaven. When the blind are given sight, we know that though we were spiritually
blind, God wants us to truly see. When the sick are healed, we know that God never created this world
for sickness, and that we will not experience sickness in heaven. When the dead are raised to life, we
are reminded that we are dead in our sins, but can be given eternal life through Christ. In fact,
everything Christ did and said is chock-full of lessons we can learn about God and about the
relationship that God wants with us. So when Jesus says, “No one knows the Father except through the
Son”, we see the value of sitting and learning from Jesus, and when Jesus turns to the disciples and
says, ""Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted
to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it,"" we understand
that the reason these kings and prophets wanted to see and hear Jesus is because they wanted to
understand God. While we are more blessed than they, in the fact that we can read all about Jesus,
nobody is more blessed than the disciples, who got to walk and talk with Jesus in the flesh.
Friends, this is why we're taking our time studying the book of Luke. And this is why we have 
a new Sunday School curriculum where we don't only teach the famous Old Testament stories, but we
show – even to pre-schoolers – how those Sunday School stories point forward to Christ. Because if
you want to be truly successful, if you want to understand God, if you want to learn how to please God
with your actions, then the very best choice is when we learn to look to Jesus.
So if looking to Jesus is the best choice, what do we make of Martha's choice to look to the job
at hand? Honestly, Looking to the job at hand is still a good choice. They aren't opposites. In fact,
they're supposed to work together. The time that we're reading about in Jesus's life is the time he spent
working for the kingdom. And all of us have grown closer to God, and probably accepted Jesus as your
Savior, precisely because people focused on the job at hand, whether it's parents or preachers, Sunday
School teachers or authors, they focused on the task of building the God's kingdom here on earth and
we reaped the benefits. That's exactly what Martha was doing this day. In an ancient patriarchal
society, the greatest value she could provide for God's kingdom was opening up her home so that Jesus
could have a place to talk and teach. This isn't a bad choice, but it's not the best choice either. Let me
explain why.
The ideal scenario is that we would look to Jesus to understand God, that we would look to
Jesus to understand salvation. That we would look to Jesus to understand what we're called to do here
on earth. Then, having been grounded in the gospel by looking to Jesus, we would turn our attention to
the job at hand. Then, being filled with Christ, we would set about the task of living it out. Last weeks
passage said as much. First, love the Lord your God with your heart, soul, mind, and strength, then
second, love your neighbor. James puts it this way in James 2:26, “As the body without the spirit is
dead – so faith without deeds is a dead faith.” And Paul says in Ephesians 2:8-10, “You have been
saved, by grace, through faith. It is a gift of God, and not through works so that no one can boast. You
are God's workmanship, created in Jesus Christ to do good works.”
Even though works don't save us, we cannot separate our faith from our works. This is why
looking to Jesus is the best choice, and looking to the job at hand is merely a good choice. Imagine you
only had one or the other. The ideal is that they go together, but if you only looked to Jesus, your faith
would be incomplete. You wouldn't be a good and faithful servant, and you might not even be truly
saved, but you can build on it. Your faith would likely grow as you continued to sit at Jesus's feet, and
sooner or later you would be motivated to do the works. It's incomplete – but with hope. On the other
hand, if you had works without faith, that's the danger. There's lots of people like this in the world who
think that going to heaven is a matter of being a good person or who think that tithing and coming to
church is what merits salvation. There might even be some here today who work hard, but never spend
any time sitting at Jesus's feet. This too, is incomplete, but in a much worse way, because this was the
religious life of the Pharisees, and the religious life of the idol worshipers. As you work and work for
what you think God wants you to do, it puffs you up, it makes you proud, it makes you less likely, not
more, to listen to what Jesus is saying. I'm a good person already, so why do I need to listen to Jesus.
Yes, sitting at Jesus's feet is the best choice, because even though it's incomplete, it's incomplete
with hope. Focusing on the task is a good choice, but not the best choice, because if that's all there is,
it's incomplete without hope. But if looking to Jesus is the best choice, and looking to the job at hand is
a good choice, what then, is the bad choice?
What was it, that started this whole conversation with Martha? It wasn't that Martha was going
about her business and Jesus stopped her and said, “You need to be paying more attention to me!” It
was Martha coming to Jesus and saying, “Look at Mary – not helping out at all.” The bad choice is
looking to judge others. Unfortunately, this bad choice is sometimes the most common choice, 
especially when, like Martha, we're frazzled or overwhelmed. Even in the calm times, though, it's a
natural human tendency to look at someone else and think, “They should be more like me!”
It's a pity, because no two people are designed the same way, and everybody struggles with this
balance of meditation and ministry. There is no perfect solution, but I'll tell you, when I think about the
men and women who have been formative in my own Christianity, my mentors include both Mary's
and Martha's. One of my mentors was my youth pastor when I was in Junior High. He was a deep
theologian, always reading his Bible in Greek and Hebrew, and it seemed that every time I talked to
him, he would say something that would cause me to profoundly re-think how I understood Jesus. He
pushed me to be more of a Mary than I ever thought normal. But I think of others, the the pastor who
first mentored me when I entered ministry. He had more insights into effective ministry than anyone I
knew. And while I hardly would consider myself a perfect balance – I'm not – both of these men, the
Mary and the Martha taught me so much that I still put into practice on a daily basis. I'm grateful for
both. But if we're not careful, when we encounter someone different than us, instead of seeing it as an
opportunity to challenge ourselves and grow, we see it as an excuse to condemn and to judge. That was
Martha's real problem.
Friends, it's good to serve Jesus with your actions and live every moment aware of the jobs that
lie before you, committed to seeing that they are done with excellence. It's very good. It's even better
when we take the time to build our relationship with Jesus, going to God's Word, going to the Lord in
prayer, reflecting on God's great character and love, and worshiping Him for all that he's done for us.
Then building our own ministry on the rock that is Christ. We can do both and we ought to do both.
There's a saying, a famous quote, attributed to Eleanor Roosevelt. “Great minds talk about
ideas, average minds talk about events, small minds talk about people.” You've probably heard that,
but long before Eleanor Roosevelt was born, Jesus was at the home of Martha and Mary, and in this
conversation we discover, “Great Christians root themselves by looking to Jesus. Good servants are
sure to look at the job at hand. But we fail to be Great Christians or Good Servants, when our eyes are
focused, looking to judge others.” So sit at Christ's feet, and go about Christ's ministry, but learn from
one another, rather than condemn one another.

"I had never heard of a Good Samaritan law until the final episode of Seinfeld. Do you
remember that show? The final episode saw them vacationing to some quaint New England town
where they witness someone being mugged, and instead of helping, they laughed and made fun of the
situation. This was very typical of the Seinfeld crew. In this town, however, they went on trial for not
helping. They were in violation of the Good Samaritan law.
Did you know Minnesota has a Good Samaritan law, too? If you see someone in distress, you are
obligated to try and help. If you don't, according to the law, you are guilty of a misdemeanor. Then,
because we live in America, there's a 2nd part of the Good Samaritan law says that if you try to help
and you screw up, you can't be sued for trying to help. But you're legally obligated to help others. It's
ironic, because the Good Samaritan wasn't legally obligated. In fact, that's almost the point Jesus is
making. but it bears witness to the fact that the story of the Good Samaritan, as much as any story in
the Bible is still well-known by society, even if it's not properly understood.
Our passage this morning actually starts a few verses before. Jesus is giving 3 sets of teachings
about how God reveals himself. First, God has hidden his truth from the wise and learned, and given
his truth to children. Second, God is revealed through Jesus. Now God is revealed a lot of ways, but
none are more accurate or more complete than by observing the life, ministry, and teaching of Jesus
Christ. Finally third, prophets of old wished that they could see this day arriving, the day of Christ, but
those who came alongside Christ (and after) are much more blessed. We'll be looking at the 2nd and
3
rd teachings next week. They really go with the next account. But the first lesson – that God has
hidden his truth from the learned, and revealed it to the simple and the childlike - that's what it's all
about today.
Our lesson today starts with a learned scholar coming to ask Jesus a question. It says that he was an
expert in the law, and he has a chance to ask Jesus a question. I don't know about you – there's a lot
of questions I'd like to ask Jesus. It happens all the time, I come across something in the Bible that I
don't understand or I experience something in life that I don't understand, and I say, ""When I get to
heaven, I can't wait to ask God or Jesus this question."" That's not why this expert in the law was
asking Jesus a question. He was asking to test Him, because he, like many learned people in this
world, was convinced that he already knew it all. He believed that there was nothing he could learn,
but he wanted to show off how knowledgeable he was.
Maybe today, you're tempted to say, ""Oh, I already know the Good Samaritan story.”, but that's the
very attitude that keeps us from gaining God's wisdom. Instead, let approach this story like children,
ready to learn from what God has given us in this story.
Our story begins with an expert in the law coming to Jesus – to test him - and asking Jesus this
question, “What must I do to inherit eternal life?"" Jesus, knowing that this man knew the law, turned
the question around, “What does the law say about this?” The expert in the law answers, quite rightly,
“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with
all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'"" Jesus responds, “That's right – you got it – do
this and you will live.” See, the expert in the law failed to stump Jesus. In fact, Jesus showed that this
learned man already knew the answer he claimed to be seeking. It embarrassed the expert to have
his true motives shown, so he responded with a 2nd question, “Alright – but who is my neighbor?” It's
with this that Jesus launches into this famous parable.
A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped
him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. Now the road from Jerusalem to
Jericho wasn't a particularly dangerous road, although any major roadway posed significant dangers
in these times. Thieves would gather together to prey on someone who was traveling. After all,
people who were traveling usually had a fair amount of money on them. They had to have money for
food and shelter once they arrived. There were no ATMs in those days, obviously, and a traveler could
be counted on to have a lot of cash on hand. Travelers were also great targets because they didn't
have relations in the area. If you attacked and stole from someone local, chances are they had some
relatives who would come and take the money back. For this reason, people would often travel in
caravans, knowing that there's safety in numbers. But if you encountered a lonely traveler, they were
easy pickings without much fear of retribution. So these thieves encountered this man traveling alone
on the road. They attacked him in force, and stole what he had. In attacking him, they beat him
mercilessly, leaving him half dead, lying on the side of the road. (And this is actually an important
point.) Because the next thing that happens, as this man lies there half dead, is people start to walk
by him. A priest happened to be going down this same road, and when he saw the man, he passed
on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, he passed by on the
other side.
I want to pause here for a moment to consider what is happening. Priests and Levites are the exact
people you would expect to help someone who is hurting. After all, the priests were the ones whose
job it was to be religious leaders. They would have been the equivalent of our pastors and, well,
priests. They were the clergy of Israel, and we know that the Old Testament talks about the
importance of helping those who need help. In fact, one of the most consistent commands for those in
power is that they pay careful attention to protect those who are unable to protect themselves.
Typically, it would be the widows and the orphans, but other times, it's the foreigners who have no
family locally. Certainly, under that criteria, it would be this beaten traveler The Levites were one of
the tribes of Israel, but an important one. They were a consecrated tribe, and it was from this Levitical
tribe that all the priests were chosen. They were the Holy tribe of Israel. For a modern day
comparison, we might say these are the leaders in the church: the Church Council members, the
Sunday School teachers, the ones that the rest of the church looks up to. So if we were to tell this as
a modern parable, it would be a pastor who first comes along and passes on the other side. Then
would come an elder, a church council member, who passes on the other side. And before we can go
on – we have to ask - is Jesus exaggerating the reaction for the sake of this learned expert he's
talking to?
I can't think of a lot of times I've passed on the other side, but I have to admit, I can think of a few.
The handful of times it happened, it was when we were living in Philadelphia. Up ahead on the
sidewalk there would be some argument going on, shouting and swearing and maybe even fists flying,
and you never knew who might pull out a gun. It was better to just steer clear and stay out of the way.
Maybe that's all that's going on here, ""I don't want to be collateral damage"" or ""I don't want to get
hurt"", but it's hard to see how this beaten down man posed a threat. It's unlikely that the robbers stuck
around. Robbers usually take off once they have their loot, and certainly this man didn't pose a threat.
He's lying there half-dead, so I don't think they were crossing the road out of a concern for their
personal safety.
Maybe Jesus is just painting them in the worst possible light. Those good-for-nothing priests and
those hypocritical religious people, surely they wouldn't help out someone who's been attacked. I've
heard people make this exact point, that religious people are the most uncaring and unloving people
around. After all, it's just a story, Jesus can tell it any way that he wants. But if it was just to point out
how mean religious people were, or if Jesus was casting the priest and the Levite in an unfair light, we
would think that this expert in the law who came along to test Jesus, who was sure that he was
smarter than Jesus, and who might have been a priest or a Levite (and if he wasn't, he certainly was
friends with priests and Levites), you would think that this man would have no problem calling Jesus
out on his exaggeration. Hey Jesus, I know nobody is perfect. I know there's bad apples in any
bunch, but do you really expect me to believe that TWO religious people would be so mean and
heartless in a row? Your story is silly, Jesus, that would never happen.
But he doesn't call Jesus out. He doesn't cry foul. I think the reason that he doesn't is because up to
this point in the story, he's probably been nodding his head. That's exactly what they would do. Why?
Because an expert in the law would know, a priest or a Levite would know, that there was a better than
average chance that this man was dead. That's the image, remember, he's half dead, unconscious on
the side of the road. And if this traveler was dead from his beatings, there is really nothing the priest
or the Levite could do to help. But it could harm them. See, if they touched a dead body, they would
become unclean. They wouldn't be allowed to go to the temple. They wouldn't be allowed to
associate with others. They'd have to ostracize themselves until the proper amount of time has
passed before they could be clean again. And more than just the inconveniences that go with being
unclean, for the priest or Levite who is saturated in the law, just the thought of becoming unclean
probably repulsed them. So why take the chance? So I suspect that when this expert in the law
heard that they passed to the other side, he was probably standing there nodding. Yes – that's the
right thing to do. God tells us to stay as clean and as pure as possible, why would you sully your
cleanness, especially if there's probably nothing you can do.
Now I'm not saying this is right thinking, to value your own cleanliness over the chance that you might
be able to help someone else. It's not. But I suspect that we Christians sometimes do this same
thing. It's not ""ritual cleanliness"" that serves as our excuse, but we find our excuses anyway. We see
a controversy going on in our society, and while we know that it's a moral issue, it's also a political
issue, so we say, ""Well...Church shouldn't be political, let's just avoid the whole thing.” Or we see
someone hurting, asking for money, and we think, ""Well...I would give them money. But they might
spend it on drugs or on booze.” Or we see a neighbor of ours struggling through life, but we think,
""Well...I could help them. But don't their kids live close by? They should be the ones taking care of
them."" Or we see a friend making unwise decisions that we know are going to come back to haunt
them, and we think...well...it's really none of my business. And I don't want to be one of those 'judgy'
Christians. I'll hold my tongue on this one.” And somehow, we manage to excuse ourselves out of an
uncomfortable calling. We make excuses, not because we don't want to help others, and not because
we don't want to stand up for Christ, and not because we don't care about right and wrong, but
because it's uncomfortable or inconvenient and our excuses make it palatable to do nothing. “Well...I
would help this beaten down man...but I don't want to make myself unclean.”
But then a Samaritan, as he traveled, came across this man. And when he saw him, he took pity on
him. He went and he bandaged the wounds, pouring oil and wine. Then he put him on his own
donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. The next day, he took 2 denarii, and gave it to the
innkeeper. ""Look after him"", he said, ""and when I return I will reimburse you for any extra expense
you may have.""
Now the Samaritan could have had his excuses too. He was obviously going somewhere, and
probably wanted to get there, and Samaritans and Jews didn't get along. We might expect the
Samaritan would think, “Why should I help this guy? Let a Jewish person, maybe a priest or a Levite,
help him.” But that isn't what he did. He stopped and helped this beaten traveler, and he did so at
considerable expense to himself. It took his time. The oil and the wine that he poured over the
wounds, they weren't free. He took him to an inn where he put the man up for the night, and then
when he was ready to continue his journey, he took 2 denarii – 2 days wage – and gave it to the
innkeeper with the promise that when he returned, he would reimburse whatever expense was
necessary to care for this man - a stranger.
We're not told what was going on in his mind or in his heart, why the Samaritan decided to stop, but he
did. I imagine that the expert in the law, who was nodding along about the importance of ritual
cleanliness, now began to feel a twinge of shame. Especially when Jesus drove it home, “Which of
these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the robbers?"" The
answer was obvious, and the expert in the law replied, “The one who had mercy.”
So Jesus said, “Go and do likewise.” Go, and be like the Samaritan, because he was the one who
showed mercy. Go, and be like the Samaritan, because he was the one who had kindness. Go, and 
be like the Samaritan, because even though you are inclined to look down on him, he's the one that
got it right. Go, therefore, and do likewise.
Now I don't know if you caught it. Jesus didn't actually answer the question he was asked. The expert
in the law asked, ""Yes, I should love my neighbor...but who is my neighbor?"" This is a limiting
question. In other words, “What's the bare minimum I have to do to go to heaven?” It misses the
point, asking “Who qualifies for my love?”
That's not the question that Jesus answered. Instead, with the story that Jesus told – and the lesson
that he taught, he was answering the question, ""What does it look like if you truly love your neighbor?""
“What does real neighborly love look like?” It looks like the Good Samaritan, who instead of making
excuses, and instead of focusing on the differences between him and the beaten stranger, he stopped
and helped him. He gave of what he had, and then he gave more. He showed us what it is to love
our neighbor.
Jesus answered that question with his life as well. We were the beaten down travelers when, as
sinners, each of us has lived lives at times that said to God, ""I don't need you. I'm going to live my
own life, I'm going to do what I want."" Chances are, the consequences of our sin did also beat us
down at one time or another. But Jesus had mercy on us. Jesus came down to our level, becoming
human, and even coming to earth was a considerable sacrifice, to give up heaven so that he could be
born in the flesh. But then Jesus went further. He let himself be slain on the cross to redeem, to bring
salvation, to the very ones who crucified Him.
What does it mean to love your neighbor? Jesus didn't make excuses, instead he gave everything he
had – in love for us. The question isn't, ""Who is my neighbor? Who do I have to love if I'm going to be
worthy of going to heaven.” The real question is, ""What does real love look like? What does it mean
to really love my neighbor?""
It means having mercy, whether the person deserves your mercy or not. It means giving of yourselves
like Christ gave of Himself. It means giving of our resources like the Good Samaritan did for the
beaten man at the side of the road. Friends, go and do likewise. Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",10/04/015,
"""I just want to be happy."" Have you ever heard someone say that? Sometimes people
say it because they're disappointed with something in their life. Other times, it's when people are
talking about the future. As a youth pastor, I'd often ask kids, ""What are you hoping for in life?"" And
the answer I would get, ""I just want to be happy.""
It's also one of the most pointless things to say. It's meaningless. After all, is there anybody out
there, at all, who doesn't want to be happy? Does anyone actually say, ""I just want to be sad.""? Of
course not. So when someone says, ""I just want to be happy"", you almost need to immediately ask,
""And what would make you happy?"" Because what makes us happy is different for every person, and
obviously, it affects whether or not you'll be happy. If you'll only be happy if you win the lottery, then
you're going to have a lot of sad days ahead. But if all you need is a roof over your head and food on
your table, you have a better chance for being happy.
A lot of people aren't happy, and if they are, they're not happy all the time. So we need to ask,
""What will make you happy?"" Your happiness depends on it. That's the point that Jesus is talking
about in our passage this morning. You remember last week, Jesus was giving a pep-talk. He sent 72
of his followers out into the towns around Judah. They were to go to people's houses, risking being
rejected, so that they could preach the good news that God's kingdom was now at hand. If they weren't
rejected, if they were welcomed, they were to teach and heal and all sorts of ministry in that town.
Well this week, the disciples and his other followers have completed their mission. They went
out, and now they're coming back, and they are so excited. They might have been nervous before they
left, but they came back in a pretty good mood. Not only were they embraced – we can assume -
rather than being rejected, but they all experienced splendid ministries. ""Lord, even the demons submit
to us in your name"", they exclaimed. Even though Jesus, in this commissioning, didn't mention the
power to cast out demons, they were able to heal people who were posessed or oppressed with a snap
of their fingers. Not surprisingly, they were pretty happy about it, but Jesus, ever the damp rag,
squashes this enthusiasm. He sees their joy about their successful ministry and he launches into a
teaching moment.
He replied, ""I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. I have given you authority to trample
on snakes and scorpions and to overcome the power of the enemy, nothing will harm you. However, do
not rejoice that the Spirits submit to you.""
Now I have to say, this is one of the more confusing and debated passages in the Bible
Because we're really not sure what Jesus was talking about when he said, ""I saw Satan fall like
lightning from heaven"", there's about 20 different ideas of what this means, but two ideas that are the
most common. Some commentators think Jesus is saying that He saw this happening while he was on
earth, that at some point – either at his baptism, or at the temptation, or even while the disciples were
out casting out demons - Jesus saw the spiritual reality and saw Satan's power plummit. Other
commentators think – and I lean this way - that Jesus is talking about the time before the foundations of
the world when Satan rebelled against God. And Jesus saw God cast Satan out of heaven.
We really don't know, but either way, the message is clear. Jesus is saying, ""You're getting so
excited about casting out some demons. I've seen something much bigger, where Satan himself is done
in for. But I have a message for you. Yes – I've given you spiritual power that you can't even imagine.
Yes – nothing can harm you while I am protecting you. Yes – you have the power to overcome the
enemy. Still, for everything amazing that I've seen, and for everything amazing that I do for you, and
for everything miraculous you can do through me, none of this is really the reason for rejoicing. 
""Rather, rejoice that your names are written in heaven. Jesus is getting to a very fundamental
truth about ministry. (Remember – the word for ministry is service; the word for minister is servant.
So whoever we are, whatever our ministry is, this message is for us. Do not rejoice in your ministry,
but rejoice in your salvation. Of course, at first glance, it seems like these aren't opposites. It's true,
you can rejoice in both at the same time, but this way of speaking – the comparison – is to help us get
to the root of our joy.
What is giving us the most joy? What is making us the happiest? While I know many pastors
who struggle with this, this message is mot just for pastors. Because whether we're preaching on
Sunday, or teaching Sunday School classes, hulping out at the Pork Supper, or just telling your friends
about Jesus, the response that we get to our ministry and our work, often affects our attitude. As an
example, I try very hard not to care about numbers here at Zion, but it seems like a better Sunday when
we have 90 compared to when we have 50. It always seems like a better Sunday School class when the
kids are well-behaved and remember their lessons, than when they're wild and you can't get them to
pay attention at all. If you've served in ministry at all, you know that some weeks you'll come home
thrilled with how it all went, but other weeks you'll want to throw in the towel. And while this lesson
speaks of ministry, it applies just as well to other sources of joy:
Rejoice not in a successful ministry
Rejoice not when your paycheck is large
Rejoice not when your children are well-behaved
Rejoice not when your team wins the championship
Rather – rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
There's 3 reasons why it's better to rejoice in your salvation than in anything else that might
bring us some measure of happiness. The first reason is – salvation offers of constant joy. Let me
begin by sharing a story with you. Charity's grandfather is one of the greatest men I know. He's a
retired pastor, church planter, and missionary. He's done more for God's kingdom than most. But he's
also losing a step. His brain doesn't work as quick as it used to, and he's experienced some early
symptoms of Alzheimer's. I tell you this because he's come to rely on certain phrases - certain
responses to situations. And every time I see him, when I ask him how he's doing, he always says the
same thing, ""I'm rejoicing in the Lord"".
It's from him that I took the title of the sermon: Rejoicing in the Lord. No matter what the
situation is, whether you're having a good day or a bad day, if you know how to find your joy in Jesus,
you always have it, and it doesn't change. The Bible tells us in Romans 8, that if we are in Christ, if
we've gone to Jesus for our forgivenness, and we've received new life from God through Jesus, then
nothing, neither angels nor demons. neither life nor death, neither the present nor the future, nor
anything on earth, above the earth, or below the earth can separate from God's love. In Ephesians 1,
we're told that when we become Christians, we are sealed by the Spirit, protected until the final day.
Once you are saved, God will keep you in his hand. There is nothing else so constant.
If you rejoice in high attendance, you'll weep in low attendance. If happiness is built on
children listening and obeying, then you'll be sad when they don't. If you joy comes from a big
paycheck, then a small paycheck will break your heart. Whatever it is we seek to find our joy in in this
world, whether it's ministry or money or success or whatever, when circumstances change we will lose
all our joy. The only circumstance that we can always count on is our salvation. It never changes and
never goes away, so find your joy there.
The 2nd reason you should rejoice in your salvation over everything else is that salvation brings
growing joy. Now this is related to the unchanging nature of salvation, but it's a little bit different.
When I talk about salvation being a constant joy, I have in view the fact that everything in this world
changes over time. Things get better and things get worse. But when I talk about how salvation brings
growing joy, I'm talking about the fact that what we crave, as people, also is always changing.
Perhaps the best illustration will be one that any parent can relate to. Christmas is quickly coming.
It's hard to believe that it's less than 100 days away. And with Christmas coming, so do children's wish
lists. Kids are making their lists and checking them twice, so that when it comes time to tell Santa,
parents, and grandparents what they are wanting, they know that list cold. Of course they promise that
if you give them the big thing on the list, they'll be happy and behave all year long. No more
complaining, they offer. But then they get the gift, and they're happy – for a few days at least. Then
something strange happens. It isn't long before something new catches their eye. Now they're not so
happy anymore. The joy of that gift has faded away.
As adults, we do that too. I say that I'm thrilled when we have 90 in attendance, but if we had 90 every
week, it wouldn't be long before I'd start wanting a hundred. We may say we're happy if we can pay all
our bills on time, but then we think – I wish I had a newer car, nicer house, more money to spend. It
seems to be the way with everything in the world. Once we get it, we're happy for a short time, but the
joy fades and we are looking for something newer and better.
That's not the way it is with salvation, though. Maybe because salvation is eternal, or maybe
because heaven remains in the future. I don't know why, but I'm pretty confident that when we get to
heaven, it won't grow old on us. When we get to heaven, we won't start wishing for a better heaven.
Salvation, too, doesn't seem to grow old. As we understand it better, we become more grateful for our
salvation. I'm more grateful for my salvation today than the day I first came to know the Lord. The joy
of salvation has done nothing but grow.
And you know, as a pastor, one of my privileges is that I get to sit by the bedside of those about
to go meet the Lord. Let me tell you, as they look into the dark abyss of death, that's the very moment
when their joy of salvation is at its greatest, because in those moments, you realize how quickly this
world fades away, and how bright the hope of heaven is. If we seek our joy in anything worldly,
ministry or otherwise, it will fade. But if we find our joy in the truth that our names are written in
heaven, friends, that's a joy that only grows bigger.
So the first reason that joy in salvation is superior is that salvation never changes. The second
reason is that our joy in salvation only gets bigger and better. The third reason – and an important one
– that we should rejoice in our salvation is that salvation brings intimate joy. As much as we care about
those we minister to, they still exist outside of us. Our friends and family, as close as we are to them,
they too exist outside of us. But our relationship with God and our eternal dwelling place is as
personal, intimate, and important as you can get. In a sense, this comes down to change as well.
Think of yourself in Jr. High or High School. Who were the people you cared about? Who
were the people that shared your joy and your sorrows? Think of your circle of friends in those days,
your teammates on the sports team, that guy or girl you had a crush on. Chances are you shared great
joys with them, and maybe a few awful moments too that brought you closer together, but that was
then. But what about now? Now that you're grown and married, gotten jobs and raised families, how
long has it been since you talked to those old friends?
Ministry can be this way too. I'll never stop caring about the students I ministered to in
Philadelphia, or in Connecticut before that. I expect you'll never stop caring about the children you
coached, or the kids in Sunday School that you taught. But time, too, has changed the nature of these
relationships. Your investment in those lives has grown smaller over time. But your investment in
your own life? In your own well being? In your own relationship with God? The importance of these
things in your life, haven't changed at all. Salvation and our relationship with God and the promise of
our heavenly home will always stand this test of time.
It brings us joy in a most intimate way. A way that we never grow distant from, and a way that
never fades out of our lives. If we base our joys in ministry, or if we seek our joys in our human
relationships, then even in the very best of circumstances, we'll find ourselves having to replace and regrow
these relationships over time. But if we base our joys in our relationship with God... God is
always there. God always matters to us, and we always matter to Him.
So friends, let us heed Jesus's word today. While Jesus has given us an amazing privilege to
work on his behalf, and he was equipped every one of us with powerful spiritual gifts to accomplish
that work, we need to avoid the trap of letting ministry (or any other earthly thing) be the ultimate
source of joy in our life. If you just want to be happy the recipe is easy. Rejoice that your name is
written in heaven, because our place in heaven is constant, and it brings us constant joy. Rejoice that
your name is written in heaven, because our heavenly home grows closer and brigher every day, and it
brings us a growing joy. Rejoice that your name is written in heaven because our salvation is the most
important thing we can experience, lasting forever, and a lasting relationship with God will bring us an
intimate joy that the world cannot match.
Friends, do not rejoice in the things of the world. Rather, rejoice in the Lord. Let us pray...",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",9/27/2015,
"“There's a tradition in tournament play to not talk about the next step until you've climbed the
one in front of you. I'm sure going to the State Finals is beyond your wildest dreams, so let's just keep
it right there. Forget about the crowds, the size of the school, their fancy uniforms, and remember
what got you here. Focus on the fundamentals that we've gone over time and time again. And most
important, don't get caught up thinking about winning or losing this game. If you put your effort and
concentration into playing to your potential, to be the best that you can be, I don't care what the
scoreboard says at the end of the game, in my books, we're gonna be winners, alright?”
With that speech, the small 7-person squad of Hickory High School went on to defeat the
mighty team from South Bend in one of the greatest sports movies ever, Hoosiers. And while I
certainly didn't do justice to Gene Hackman's portrayal of Coach Norman Dale, this short speech is
one of the most famous and familiar pep-talks in our culture.
Pep-talks are important. They rouse us to achieve things we thought impossible. They inspire
us to keep going when things look bleak. And pretty much every movie, sports or otherwise, knows
that the power of a good pep-talk can make all the difference when heading out to accomplish
something big.
Today, Jesus is giving a pep-talk. He's about to send out 72 workers, sending them to every
town that he was going to, to prepare the town for Jesus. But before Jesus sends them out, he's
going to give them a pep-talk, and a pep-talk always involves 3 elements. The 3 elements we will find
in our text this morning. The 1st necessity for a half decent pep-talk is a call to action, telling the
hearers what the task at hand will be. The 2nd necessary element in a pep-talk is to warn about the
dangers: what obstacles they might encounter and the best way to respond to those obstacles. Then
finally, there is the measure of success, what it will look like if you've accomplished your goals.
For the 1954 Hickory High basketball team, they were going to play the game, and the call to
action was to focus on the fundamentals and play to their potential. The dangers they faced were
getting caught up in the unimportant stuff: the size of the crowd, the size of the school and their fancy
uniforms. The measure of success wasn't whether they won or lost the game, but whether they
played the very best they could...”then you'll be winners in my book.” Now the 72 followers of Jesus
had a different task at hand, with different dangers, and a different measure of success, but the 3
elements are still present in the pep-talk Jesus gives today.
He starts with the call to action. “The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord
of the harvest, therefore, to send workers into the harvest field.” Last week, we gave thanks for a
plentiful harvest. The farmers were having a good year, we observed, and we thanked God for this
blessing. But imagine the feelings you'd have if after planting the seed and caring for the soil, you
came to the harvest time. Then, looking out and seeing the most abundant harvest you've seen in
years, more than you would have ever imagined, you realize that none of your equipment would work,
and the people were so busy with their own things that they wouldn't help harvest your field. The idea
is a little distressing. There is plenty of harvest, food for the taking, and yet nobody is interested at all.
This is the situation Jesus is describing.
Of course, when Jesus talks about the harvest, he's not talking about crops or food. He's
talking about people. When he looked out into the world around him, he saw how many people were
looking and searching for an answer. Every town he went to, he surrounded by giant crowds. Every
time he healed, the crowds pressed in against him. Every time he taught, they were rapt with
attention. Too many people to count, and yet, there weren't enough workers. On the very best of
days, Jesus had 72 to send out ahead of him. Seventy-two people for a nation – or several nations.
So the call to action that Jesus gives his disciples: harvest abundantly, reap liberally, work all day and
all night if you have to, because the harvest is plentiful and the workers are few. 
And we have to ask ourselves, does this situation apply today as well. At first glance, we might
not think so. The Christian church is as large as it's ever been. If you include everyone who claims to
be a Christian, the number is about 2.3 billion. While certainly not everyone who claims Christianity is
a true follower, no matter who you divide it down, there's more than a few. And is the harvest
plentiful? Again, we might be inclined to say, “No.” We've talked to people about our faith, and when
we have, we've often been met with arguments, excuses, and anger at the Christian church. For
many of us, the best response is a civil conversation, and the worst response is a heated battle.
Either way, there's no harvest to speak of.
We need to take a closer look, however. It's true that much of the time people get defensive,
because they believe Christianity has nothing to offer them. They've seen people who claim to be
Christians do terrible deeds. They turn on the news and see Christians full of hate. They hear that
they can be good people without the bother of going to church on Sunday. And so they think to
themselves, “I want nothing to do with Christianity.” But while terrible things have been done in the
name of Christianity, the harvest isn't about getting more people to go to church. The harvest is
bringing people to Christ, and Christ – Jesus – gives hope to a world that is hurting.
When I look at this world, I see a world where we have more conveniences than ever before.
So many of life's tasks are automated. We have so much machinery to make life easier, and yet
people are busier than ever. To them, Jesus said, “Come to me, and I'll give you rest.”
When I look at the world, I see a world where people are more connected than ever: cell
phones, facebook, email, and skype. Yet people report being more lonely, more isolated than ever.
For all our connections, we have a million relationships that are only an inch deep and can't be
counted on in times of trouble. But Jesus says, “Come to me, and you'll be part of my body: a
community that is unified, shares one another's burdens, and goes the extra mile. (This is part of why
we have growth groups starting this fall, to connect us with one another in deeper ways).
When I look at this world, I see scores of people searching for love, starving themselves and
boasting to anyone who will listen, just so they can seem more lovable. All too often, they find
themselves surrounded by other self-centered people who are trying to use them for their own ends,
and they never get the love they crave. But Jesus says, “Come to me, and you'll be accepted, just as
you are. You'll be loved more than you can ever imagine.”
And if we ask ourselves, “Is there still plenty of harvest?”, it begs these questions: “Are people
still hurting?” “Are people still yearning?” “Are people still hoping for a better tomorrow with no idea
how to get there?” I think they are, and I know that Jesus promises a better tomorrow. The harvest is
indeed plentiful, but the workers are few.
Too many claim to follow Jesus or claim to be Christians, but they go to church each week
asking, “How can the church serve me?” Or they say, “I'll follow Jesus, so long as it doesn't interfere
with my life.” They rest on the laurels of being a good person, civilized with a good reputation. And if
they do screw up, it doesn't really matter, because forgiveness is just a quick prayer away. But Jesus
lived and died for the harvest, and if we're going to follow Jesus, we need to work for the harvest as
well. It doesn't always mean knocking door-to-door (although it can). It doesn't even always mean
witnessing and evangelizing (although it should). But we work for the harvest when we offer to pray
for someone. We work for the harvest when we return anger with love. We work for the harvest when
we serve one another in church. We work for the harvest when we train up our children. The harvest
is plentiful, and the workers are few. So be a worker – for God's harvest – that is our call to action.
The 2nd part of the pep-talk is the warning of danger. Jesus paints us a picture when he says,
“Behold, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.” For the 72 he was sending out that day, it
meant they would carry no provision. They would go to a town and into a house, and if they were 
accepted, the people would be blessed. If they were rejected, they were to shake the dust off their
sandals, saying, “If you don't want to give us provision, we will take nothing from you, not even the dirt
that sticks to our feet as we walk. You are rejecting God's goodness. You are rejecting God's
blessing. And we want to make it clear that we're not taking anything from you at all.”
For us, while being rejected is still a real possibility, it's not quite the same situation we're in.
We're not going to people who have never heard of Jesus, in fact, pretty much everyone we've ever
met has heard of him. And if we are rejected, we still have a home to go to at night. So moving in or
shaking dust, isn't a good example of what we face.
But we are still sent like lambs among the wolves. Wolves like to hung and to kill, and the
wolves in our lives are the people who are filled with bitterness and anger and are just waiting to lash
out. “Who might I devour today?” Wolves also like to prey on the weak, so they're the bullies who hit
you when you're down. They pile onto your mishaps to make you feel low. They talk behind your
back because putting you down makes them feel like they're moving up. Wolves love to fight and are
quick to attack whether you deserve it or not, and the truth is, we all have wolves in our life, don't we?
I know I do. But we are to be lambs vulnerable to the attacks of the wolves, not fighting back fire with
fire, but returning wickedness with kindness and returning hatred with love. If we do that, we know
what will happen. We will be taken advantage of.
Probably the most common question I get asked as a pastor is this, “When does loving
someone go too far? How much of a doormat does Jesus really want me to be?” And it's a tough
one, because there isn't a perfect answer. We certainly don't want people to be abused or
endangered, but returning wickedness with kindness and hatred with love is part of the job description,
and it opens us up to being taken advantage of. So how much should we, as lambs, let the wolves
take advantage of us? As much as you can bear. As much as is useful for the harvest. As much as it
wise. And Pray that God helps you find the line in each situation, and seek wise council on how to
deal with your wolves. But know this – if you're going to work for the harvest, you will be like sheep
among wolves.
So the call to action is be a worker for the harvest. And the danger we face is you will be taken
advantage of like a sheep among wolves. The final part of the pep-talk is knowing what success will
look like, and we find it in a very surprising passage: “I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for
Sodom than for that town. Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were
performed in you had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in
sackcloth and ashed. But it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the skies? No, you will go down to the depths. He who
listens to you, listens to me; he who rejects you rejects me; but he who rejects me rejects him who
sent me.”
How is this passage helpful? First, let's look at what this picture is saying. Korazin, Bethsaida,
and Capernaum were among the towns that the 72 were heading out to. These towns were privy to
seeing Jesus in the flesh, watching him heal people, and hearing Jesus's words from his own mouth.
And the comparison is made to Sodom, Tyre, and Sidon. They are Old Testament towns who rejected
God's messengers. Those towns were destroyed for rejecting God's messengers, but Jesus says,
“Those towns, as wicked as they were, and as much as they rejected God's Old Testament
messengers, if they saw that Korazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum saw, they never would have
rejected it.”
This tells us that rejection is not a measure of success. Jesus didn't fail when they didn't
accept him. If people reject Jesus, it's not our failure. In other words, when the harvest doesn't come
through, it's not because we were bad workers. If they even rejected Jesus, then of course, we will be
rejected at times, too. 
Rather, the measure of success is what sort of guilt we will have left them with. Woe to
Korazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, because they had the very best opportunity to accept God.
They were given more reason to welcome Jesus than anyone before or since, and they still rejected
him, so their judgment is going to be bleak. On the last day, their regret will be great.
In our call to reap the harvest, of course we want to see everyone accept Jesus into their lives.
But the real test of our faithfulness is not whether everyone will accept – they won't. The test is with
those who reject Him. Will they reject Jesus despite the fact that we did absolutely everything we
could to tell them about Jesus? Or will they reject Jesus because none of God's workers ever took the
time to talk about him? In other words, will they say on judgment day, “I wish someone I trusted had
told me. I wish someone had helped me understand how Jesus really was the answer I was looking
for. I wish someone had showed me what God's love and kindness looked like. Maybe if they had, I
would have accepted him.” Or will they say, “People did tell me. People did show me. People tried to
help me understand. I just wish I had listened.”
In short, will they regret that they didn't listen? Or will we regret that they didn't hear. The
measure of success is not in the conversion numbers, but whether we have faithfully done our part as
workers for the harvest.
Friends, we are called to work for the harvest. There's tremendous blessing if we do. We will
be truly following in Jesus's footsteps, and we will experience the joy of seeing others discover how
wonderful our Lord and God is. But there is danger involved. We will be rejected and we will be
insulted. And we will be taken advantage of. But it's worth it. It's worth it if even one person accepts
Jesus Christ and comes to know God through us. And it's even worth it when they don't. Because the
measure of success isn't whether our message is accepted or rejected. It's whether we have
proclaimed God's message at all. It's all about whether we've been faithful in working God's field.
The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Let us go into the world now, committed to
diligently work for His harvest. Let us go into the world now, ready to labor for the cause of Christ. Let

"Jesus is on the road to Jerusalem, but it's going to be a long and winding road before He gets
there. This is good, for us, because that means that we get 10 chapters of teaching. In the 10
chapters that follow Jesus's revealing that He is the Christ there will be lots of lessons. There will be
clarification about what it means that Jesus is the Messiah. There will be lessons about God's
Kingdom on earth, and what all that is about. But the most prominent lesson will be this: “What does
it mean to be a follower of Jesus?”
We've already seen that Jesus calls his followers to take up their cross daily, and that's a hard
lesson. Last week, we saw that Jesus has plans for ministry, also. Our service is empowered by God.
Our services is done, not for our own gain, but out of obedience to God. The highest target for our
service is the “least” of our brothers and sisters, and we are all to serve cooperatively. All these
lessons are counter-intuitive as well. Today we have another difficult lesson about following Jesus, but
it's an important one, so let's not delay...
Our passage begins this morning with an odd encounter. Jesus and his disciples are setting
out on the road to Jerusalem. It says that once He is there, He will be taken up to heaven, and we all
know what that means. As was Jesus's habit, He sent messengers ahead of Him on the road. Their
job was to make sure that they were entering into friendly territory, and if possible, to try and make
arrangements for Jesus and the disciples to spend the night.
This was particularly important today, because today they would enter into a new territory,
Samaria. We know a little bit about Samaria from the story of the good Samaritan, and the story of the
woman at the well. Jews and Samaritans didn't always get along. This is because of something that
happened in the Old Testament when Israel was attacked by Assyria. The northern kingdom, now the
territory of Gaililee, was completely destroyed in that war. The southern kingdom, now the province of
Judah where Jerusalem is, survived and repelled the Assyrians. But the middle kingdom, Samaria,
they survived by surrendering. They adopted the Assyrian ways and worshipped the Assyrian gods.
Any Jew would have considered them a half-breed and a traitor. The Samaritans would have recoiled
at the condescending attitude. So the two people groups classed with each other mightily.
So when Jesus's advance party told them that they were going to pass through to Jerusalem,
they said, “No, we won't let you pass through our country. You'll have to cross to the other side of the
Jordan and go through that way.” And the disciples were fit to be tied.
They turned to Jesus and asked, “Should we call down fire from heaven to destroy them?” We
might wonder where they got an idea like this. It's probably from the life of the prophet Elijah. In his
time, there was a wicked king in Samaria who fell down and injured himself. Rather than turn to one
of Israel's prophets who would tell the truth, he inquired of a prophet of Ba'al. Moved by God, Elijah
climbed to the top of a mountain and predicted disaster for wicked King Ahaziah. Ahaziah sent 50
troops of soldiers up the mountain to capture him, but Elijah called down fire from heaven and they
were killed. A second time, Ahaziah sent 50 troops up the mountain, and a second time, Elijah called
down fire from heaven. Finally, on the third time, Ahaziah promised to deal with Elijah peacefully and
respectfully, and Elijah came down the mountain to prophsy. So that's probably where the disciples
got the idea: when Samaria rejects God's messenger, they get destroyed by fire. And so when
Samaria rejected Jesus by not allowing Him to pass through, they asked Jesus, “Should we call down
fire from heaven to destroy them?”
But Jesus said, “No.” Maybe Jesus was saying that not allowing them to pass through wasn't
as weighty an offense as trying to kill Him, so it wasn't justified? But it's probably deeper than that.
When Jesus was captured and put to death, he still didn't call down fire from heaven. We also know, if
we read the rest of the Bible, those who reject Jesus will receive plenty of punishment. (It's good for
us to warn people. If we don't tell people the truth about hell, it's either because we don't believe it or
we don't care enough about them to warn them). In this instance, however, what Jesus is conveying 
is that even though they rejected Jesus and would someday come under fire, the time for judgment
isn't now. Now is not the time when those who reject Jesus are punished. And still, we see God
holding off his judgment. We are still not at the time in history when people who reject Jesus will
suffer.
Instead, the suffering will come to another group of people. The ones who will suffer in this age
are the ones who choose to follow Him – us. I say this because the whole sutuation with calling down
fire is just a prelude for Jesus to teach about the cost of discipleship.
We often think about being a Christian in terms of all the benefits we receive. And we do
receive a lot of blessings from following Jesus Christ. But there is also a cost, and if we don't
recognize the cost, then we might fail to truly follow Jesus. We may be Christians in name, but God
looks at our hearts. The passages where people are calling out, “Lord, Lord” and Jesus responds,
“Depart from me, I never knew you”...we need to make sure that we aren't part of that group. And so
we see 3 potential disciples come along, each wanting to follow Jesus, but when Jesus explains the
cost of following Him, they sadly turn away. We, too, ought to consider the cost.
First, a man comes up to Jesus wanting to be one of His disciples or followers. He tells Jesus,
“I will follow you wherever you go.” This sounds commendable, but it is immediately tested by Jesus's
response, “Foxes have dens and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.”
With that, Jesus cuts to the core of the struggle.
Have you ever not known where you were going to sleep? I've been fortunate. Yes, I've been
stranded at the airport for one night, and on road trips, I didn't know which hotel I'd stay at until
evening came (and to be honest, even that stressed me out). Most of us here have enjoyed knowing
where we'll be sleeping each night. We have houses and inside the houses, we have comfy beds. It
is one of the basic levels of comfort to have a place to lay your head. And even if you don't like your
bed or would like a bigger home, just knowing where you'll be sleeping is something that most people
take for granted. So when Jesus says that the Son of Man has it worse off than foxes or birds, and
that the Son of Man doesn't have a home, He's getting down to the core of worldly comfort. This isn't
extravagance, it's a pretty basic thing. Yet Jesus says that those who follow Him cannot even be
assured of this.
Why is that? First, Jesus was a stranger in this world. There's an old church song that sings,
“This world is not my home, I'm just a passin' through.” And that is the attitude that we have to adopt if
we're going to follow Jesus. This world isn't our home. We, like Jesus, are strangers to this world.
The world will reject us. When people give us funny looks for talking about God, this reaction is the
expectation, not the exception. Second, it also means that Jesus is calling his disciples to make Him
the ultimate priority. Following Jesus must be the first and foremost, because if it comes above having
a pillow or having a bed, then it certainly comes above having cars, boats, computers, and bank
accounts. If we put anything – any worldly joy or comfort – above following Jesus, then we aren't
really following Him wholeheartedly because the Son of Man had nowhere to lay His head.
Now does this mean that everyone has to go and sell their cars and their homes and give
everything to the church? Absolutely not. God doesn't call every person to do that. He calls some
people to give up all, and they move to a monastery. And God calls all to give up some things, but the
point is this: Being a disciple means that we are willing to give it all up. If God calls us to, then
everything, be it comfort or safety or good standing in the community or money or possessions. All of
this needs to be fair game, because following Jesus matters more than these things. It's a hard
lesson, an we're just getting started.
Next, Jesus tells a man, “Come and follow me.” The man's reponse is, “Let me first go and
bury my father.” Now there is some debate about what this means. Some commentators take this 
literally. His father happened to have just died. He's in the middle of digging a grave, and the man
wants to finish this job before he follows Jesus. I don't think that's what's happening, otherwise
Jesus's response (“Let the dead bury their own dead”) makes no sense. Rather, it's probably an
idiom. It's not that his dad is a lifeless corpse on the ground, but that the man is asking to wait until his
father died. Perhaps the father is not yet on the brink of death, but the father would disapprove of his
son following Jesus, and he's saying, “Let me wait until my father is gone, then I'll follow you.” While
most parents here today would love to see their children in chruch more, this wouldn't be the case if
you weren't a Christian, and might not be the case if following Jesus meant they had to leave home.
More likely, however, his father is growing old and is no longer able to take care of himself, at
least not fully. In Jewish culture, the highest obligation anyone has is to honor and care for their
parents. So when Jesus tells the man not to stay and bury his father, Jesus is telling him that for his
disciples – his followers – their highest obligation and duty is no longer to their parents, or their work,
or even their wife and children. If you are a believer, your highest obligation is to God. To Jesus. It
won't necessarily conflict with other duties (In most circumstances, God wants us to honor our parents
and care for your children. We get these obligations from the Bible, after all.) But if God calls us to do
something, if you're a follower of Christ, then your number one obligation and duty is to follow Jesus.
For the disciples, and for anyone who claims to be a Christian, Jesus tells us that 1) following
Jesus takes priority above all worldly comforts and pleasures, and 2) following Jesus takes priority
above all worldly duties.
Now a 3rd man comes who wants to be a disciple. He's willing to give it all up. He's willing to
make Jesus his highest priority, but he has one small request, “Let me first go back and say goodbye
to my family.” And Jesus's response to this is, “Not good enough. Nobody who puts his hand to the
plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”
When I read this, I think, “Is it just me, or is Jesus being really harsh here? Is it really such a
bad thing that he wants to go and say goodbye?” But the point that Jesus is making here is that the
decision to follow Jesus is an urgent decision, and it needs to be a deliberate decision.
It's urgent because none of us know how much time we have left. A tragedy could befall any
one of us on our way home from church today, and if we're unwilling to commit now, will we ever really
be willing to commit to Jesus?
It's a deliberate decision too. I'd like to share the story of a NBA star by the name of DeAndre
Jordan. He was a free agent this year, his contract had expired, and he was wined and dined by a
number of NBA teams. Another team, the Dallas Mavericks, offered him more money and got him to
agree to a contract. But there was a 3 day waiting period before he could sign the contract, and
DeAndre Jordan decided to go back to his old team, the Clippers, to say goodbye. When he did, they
talked him out of leaving. They matched the money, and convinced him to re-sign with them. And
then they sequestered him. They kept him in a room full of Clippers staff and they took his cell phone
away. When he was hungry, they sent someone out to get it so that there was no way of anyone
finding out where he was. This continued for 3 days until he was able to sign the contract officially.
They wouldn't let him talk to the Mavericks owner because they knew he might change his mind.
Following Jesus is the same way. You can't look back because you might go back. You can't
go back because you might stay back. And you can't stay back, because then you're no longer
following Jesus. If you want to follow Jesus, follow him now. Don't waver. Because to follow Jesus
means to leave this world behind. When we do, we are promised a future that is better than anything
and everything the world can give us, so don't look back.
Friends, if I'm honest with you this morning, I think one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) 
struggle for the American church, it isn't that people are unwilling to follow Jesus. It's that those who
do follow Jesus don't follow Him all the way. We like to add Jesus on like supplemental insurance.
Then we can make sure we know where we're going. But we still like to have our things: the comforts
and the pleasures. We still like to have our worldly priorities, like family or being a good worker or
being a good citizen. Yes, we'll follow Jesus, but we won't let go of these other priorities.
In this sense, maybe unbelievers are the more honest ones. They know that following Jesus
means giving up stuff: the sins they enjoy, control over their own life, their free time on Sunday
mornings, and they readily admit they are unwilling to do it. On the other hand, we are happy (most of
the time) to give up our sins. We're willing to give up our Sunday mornings. But are we willing to
follow Jesus all the way? Will we give up everything this world might offer? Will we give up everything
that we hold dear? Will we trade in our identities for that of Jesus Christ, no matter what may come
from that decision?
Jesus calls us to follow Him fully. Let us turn our whole lives over to Him, because the life that
he gives us when we do, is so much better, so much fuller than the one we turn ",Jason Brannan,"Brownsville, MN",9/13/2015,
"That's a dangerous prayer—a seriously dangerous prayer. It was just read from Psalm 139:23-24 = ""Search me and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts, see if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."" It's a dangerous prayer. You don't invite someone to do this unless you trust them. You don't invite someone to come in and search your heart in those very closed and intimate spaces unless you trust them, because when we open ourselves in that way, we can open ourselves up to damage. When we trust people, we become vulnerable.
 
In the days of Abraham in Genesis 17 God gave circumcision as a sign between Abraham and his family that was to follow, and God. Circumcision was to serve as a sign between the Jewish people and God over the course of time and as time evolved and as we move into the times of Jesus, the teachings of the apostles talk about how it is even more important to have the circumcision of the heart. As I was thinking about these things over the last couple of weeks about circumcision given as a sign between man and God, obviously the Jew didn't go about flaunting their circumcision. Obviously that was a thing that was hidden and it was a thing that was personal; it was a thing that was secretive in a way, but because of that commitment and because of that connection between myself and God through circumcision, if I were a Jew, there should be a difference in obedience on the outside because I'm a person who lives according to the Covenant. And just as a Jew could hide their sign, so can we—those who have been circumcised of the heart. Many do; in today's world many are slow to put their hearts out there because they've been damaged, because we've been hurt, because we've been betrayed, and because of all the things we have experienced we become somewhat slow to put out there who we really are and one of the reasons we are slow to put it out there is because we don't necessarily like who we really are because we know the corruption of our hearts. We know that the Scriptures ring true that 'there's no one good, no not one.'
 
It was almost 105 years ago in the early morning hours of April 15, 1912, 1,500 people plus perished. They perished into the depths of the sea in the middle of the night, in the middle of the cold. Some stories say that the band right at the end as the Titanic was getting ready to go down was playing ""Nearer my God to Thee."" There were only enough lifeboats for half the capacity of the people traveling on that ship. And it was an iceberg that sent them to their graves—it was an iceberg that sent them to their graves and it wasn't the part that you could see that caused the damage. You see you can only see roughly 10% of an iceberg; if you're above water and you're on the top of the surface and you see the iceberg, you can only see roughly 10%--same thing if you're drinking a glass of iced tea and you put ice in it, you only see the top part of it, and it was the unseen part that did the damage. It was the stuff under the surface that sent 1,500 plus people to their watery graves.
 
So it is with a man's heart. Just as an iceberg is only 10% visible, most of our hearts are kept under the surface. Most of what you know about me and most of what I know about you is kept under the surface. Why? Because a lot of who we are is what?—it is the internal; it's our souls; it's our minds; it's what make up our spirits. There is no way that you could know all my thoughts; there is no way that I could know all of your thoughts. The people that we are—it doesn't necessarily mean that it's different—I'm just saying that the part that you can see is only a sliver of the person that you're around.
 
Proverbs 4:23 is the verse that I bounced off of last week I told you I was going to spend more weeks on this whole issue of our hearts being under siege. (He then read Proverbs 4:23.) The Scripture says that Solomon says that everything that you do flows out of a man's heart. Last week I was talking about how important it is that we know the Word of God because it is the Word of God that forms and fashions our hearts, and if we're not in consistent study and not in consistent meditation with God; if we're not in consistent connection with God, our hearts are going to be anorexic, so to speak. We're going to struggle. That's got to be our spiritual diet; it's got to be a big part of it. The Greatest Commandment is 'to love your God with all your of your heart, with all of your soul, with all of your mind and with all of your strength,' and if your heart is not being taken care of, there is no way that we can love God to full capacity and it's the very thing that Jesus said is the greatest above everything.
 
In 2 Samuel 12—actually I'm going to start in 2 Samuel 11,--we find the story of David and Bathsheba. In says in Verse 2 that (JR read it.) He was walking on the roof of his palace; now what do we know just from that verse right there? This guy is the King! He's living in a palace and surely if you're the King living in a palace, you don't have any issues, do you? You've got everything you want, except there was a void in his heart. We don't know exactly what it is or what caused it but we see what comes out of it. (He continued reading Verse 2 through Verse 4a.) And this started out his acting upon the brokenness of his heart. This started a story—this started a saga that is out of the overflow of a man's heart, as Jesus said. ""Above all else, guard your heart because everything you do flows from it."" The reason I know that David had a damaged heart is because of his actions—because of what he did. I don't have time to go through all of 2 Samuel 11, and in this room, it's probably a story many of you are familiar with, but if you read through it, it's scary how quickly God can lose His proper place in our lives and how quickly out of our brokenness we can replace things. When you get through this story, you see a story of lies, deceit, betrayal, and murder, and when I say ""betrayal"" I say betrayal because if you do a study on this and you look at it, you read that David wanted to know who this lady was; she was the wife of Uriah the Hittite. Who was Uriah the Hittite? Uriah, the Hittite—he was one of David's Mighty Men. There was a small group, a small band of soldiers, who were—in David's day—the Navy Seals; they were Green Berets; they were Rangers—they were Special Forces—I mean they were the elite special forces of his day. They were the ones who were totally sold out to David—to give their lives to protect him. And the lady that he sees is the wife of one of his most dedicated warriors and protectors, and David sends for her. When he finds out who it is, he still sends for her. She ends up pregnant. She ends up pregnant, so what does he do?—he sends for Uriah, who is out in the battlefields protecting the King. He sends for Uriah with the intent that he will come home, spend some time with his wife, and thus think that it's his child, but Uriah is so dedicated to David that he says, 'There is no way that I can do this,' so he sleeps outside the gates of the city. 'My fellow soldiers who are still in battle—there is no way that I can come home and take any pleasure,' so now David is stuck. His whole plan to deceive, and it begins where?—it begins with his heart. There was damage that was done in David's heart at some time in his life that he had not properly dealt with but it was still real—even though he couldn't see it, even though it lies underneath the surface, it's still real! The iceberg that was visible probably would have never sank the Titanic—if it was just the part that was visible, but the problem wasn't the visible part; the problem was under the surface part and if you're not willing to say 'Search me, oh God and know my heart, see if there is any wicked way in me,' then you're always going to have the stuff lingering under the surface, and as long as we have stuff under the surface that's not dealt with, it will impact the people around us. It will!
 
You know, I want to preach and I want to teach because I want to see people who have no knowledge of Jesus come to Jesus, but the reality of church these days is people ""church-hop."" People go from one church to another and you know the thing that scares me the most about that is that most of the time they bring their divorce baggage with them. If things were great where they were then they wouldn't be coming here or somewhere else. So there is stuff in there—it may not always be their fault; I'm not saying that—I'm just saying there is stuff. Have you ever known anybody that was divorced and married somebody else who was divorced and there are issues? Oh, they may still get along good, but there is just stuff, isn't there? There are just layers of stuff, and to think we don't bring that stuff with us, we're being very naive or we're being incredibly deceitful to ourselves.
 
David had baggage. It ends up that he has no choice than to fix the situation in his mind, so what's he do?—he puts Uriah back out in the battlefield. He sends word after different stuff and it's a long story but he sends word to wait until the fighting gets really, really bad and he sends word to the guy in charge to withdraw and leave Uriah there by himself so that he's killed. Rather than David deal with his own issues he tries to deal with those other issues and just takes Uriah out of the picture altogether. Well, guess what? Just because you refuse to deal with the issues that are under the surface doesn't mean those issues don't exist. So now Uriah is out of the picture and David has the woman of his dreams apparently. (JR read 2 Samuel 11:26-27.) Acting out of his brokenness created a barrier between him and God. (JR read 2 Samuel 12:1a) Understand this; when you are broken—when I am broken in those areas, God will send people to us to help get us back on track, but the question is whether or not we will receive the message. It says that ""the Lord sent Nathan to David."" (JR continued reading Verse 1b through Verse 7a.) You see David understands that in this story that he's told that this guy has a heart issue. He understands that this rich man has a problem and he's going to deal with it but then all of a sudden it's brought to his attention that 'You are the man.'  (JR continued reading Verse 9.) 'It doesn't matter that he was killed by the sword of the Ammonites; it doesn't matter that you left him out in the battlefield; it doesn't matter if you didn't actually strike the blow yourself, you are the man; you killed him.' (JR continued reading Verse 13.) That's an interesting statement to me because there are multiple layers of who he has sinned against. He's sinned against his nation, he's sinned against Uriah, he's sinned against Bathsheba, and he's sinned against his servant who he sent to do the task. He's sinned against a whole bunch of people but he goes right straight to the core where the real problem is when he said, 'I've sinned against the Lord,' (JR read Verses 13-14.) David had a broken heart; David had a broken heart in more ways than one. There was a lot of stuff under the surface that you couldn't see and it impacts the way we live. We can hide a lot of the stuff but a lot of times that's the stuff that does the most damage.
 
In Psalm 51 it's a psalm that's written in the wake of David's conversation with Nathan after Nathan had confronted him. Think about this: what a great honor it is to have a friend like Nathan—to have someone who will serve God and not worry about fear. You think Nathan wanted to have that conversation? Would you want to appear before the King who could do to you what he did to Uriah? Would you want to appear before the King and say 'Hey, look; listen to this cool story—ha, ha, ha, ha; you're the man.'  I mean David had served under a King who had picked up a spear and threw it at him trying to kill him. Nathan might have thought, 'He could do the same thing to me.' And in the wake of this conversation David cries out in Psalm 51 (JR started reading the psalm reading through Verse 4a.) What he's saying there is 'God, if I had been right with you, I would have been right with everyone else, but because I wasn't and because I sinned against you because my heart was not right,' it's the trickle-down effect. He goes right to the core of the matter. (JR continued reading Verse 4b through 12, emphasizing Verse 10.) The joy of his salvation had been lost somewhere in the midst of a broken heart. It doesn't mean that we don't have salvation, but he said, 'Restore in me the joy of the salvation.'
 
I've often said that it is an oxymoron to be a perpetually grumpy Christian. Those things just do not exist because Christians should be known by what?—by the fruits of the Spirit: love, joy, joy, joy, joy! It doesn't mean that we're always happy; doesn't mean that we don't have bad times; doesn't mean that in the midst of our sometimes overwhelming grief that we put on a fake smile—that's not what it's talking about, but in the midst of our overwhelming grief we can see the big picture and know what Paul said, 'that these struggles are momentary'—that there is still the joy of my salvation knowing that the things that we deal with here are momentary struggles.
 
(JR continued reading Verses 13-17.) Here's another verse where he speaks of his heart. #1 is the 'create in me a clean heart,' and this one he says, 'my sacrifice to you, oh, God, is a broken spirit—a broken heart.' What God wants in the sentence right before that, he said, 'It's not all this other stuff that you desire;' we could come in here today and we could sing songs, and we could give our offerings, and we could take communion and we could pray together and we could do all these above-the-surface things—we could do all these tip-of-the-iceberg things, but David gets to the core of the matter here and he says, 'My sacrifice is a broken spirit—a broken and contrite heart that you, God, will not despise.' Our hearts have to be broken before they can be fixed! Our hearts have to be broken before they can be fixed. Our hearts have to be broken before they can be made whole. Our hearts have to be broken before we can really receive the joy of our salvation.
 
Why is it that so many in the Christian world today don't express the joy of salvation? It's because we're damaged goods. It's not because of what you see on the surface; it's mostly because of the stuff you don't see that's under the surface that hasn't been dealt with, and if it's not been dealt with, friends, it's still there! It doesn't matter whether people can see it, it is still there. I don't know exactly what the brokenness of David's heart was, but I know that his heart was broken because the Scriptures say ""Above all else guard your hearts because everything you do flows from it."" David was broken and if you are broken, there will be symptoms of your brokenness. It's hard, I think; it's hard to be real and it's hard to be transparent in this world because we've been taught to put our clothes on and look nice and present ourselves in a certain way and don't let anyone see our weakness. Maybe that's where David failed; maybe it's because he was the King and he was afraid to show any weakness. I tell you what, though; if we could bring David in here today and I could sit down in a chair and interview him and we got on this subject, I'd bet money if he could replay life, this is one of those life stories that he would love to change.     
 
Do you ever cross paths with somebody that you've betrayed? You know, we try to avoid those people because we know on the insides in the middle of our brokenness, we know that we've done them wrong, so we don't like to face them. We don't like to be put in that situation because we know everything we've done—just picture for a moment David walking down the streets of Heaven and walking around the corner and bumping into Uriah. How's that conversation go? David says, 'Hey, could you show me around; I know you got here sooner than I did.' I mean, what kind of icebreaker would he use for that one? We see symptoms of people's brokenness through their actions—the question is do we trust God enough—do you trust God enough—do I trust God enough to open ourselves up to a 'heart search?' Will I let God search? Because it's not until we offer it as broken that it's going to be fixed. As long as we continue to convince ourselves there is no problem, it will just remain below the surface and the only question then is 'what boat is going to sink in our lives?' Who is it going to kill in our lives because it's going to happen? ""Above all else, guard your hearts, because everything you do flows from it.""
 
On the outside a plain brown wrapper; on the inside—solid gold! But the inside is all that matters because the outside is just for show. Those words were written by Gary Morris many years ago, but they remain very true in our culture today.
 
   On the outside a plain brown wrapper,
   On the inside, solid gold.
   But the inside's all that matters,
   Because the outside's just for show!
 
Are you willing to allow God to plunge into you and to begin to search?  Let's pray.
Closing Prayer – God, this is a delicate subject and I think a difficult subject. I got texts this past week from people that were talking about the fact that their hearts are damaged from the things that I spoke on last week. Lord, I don't think there is any question whether our hearts are damaged; the question is whether or not we are willing to allow you to come in and begin the process of restoring us and restoring the joy of our salvation. God, I just thank you for your love; I thank you for your compassion; I thank you for understanding our brokenness and loving us in spite of it. God, you are good and Lord, I thank you for David's reaction to Nathan. I thank you that when confronted with his own heart issues he was willing to respond and this story ends up beautifully, and the picture that I have in Heaven is David doesn't really have a chance to say anything to Uriah because, I believe, that Uriah probably just embraces him because the stuff they experienced here was in a place of brokenness that when we leave this side of the world, so to speak, we will be living in a place without the brokenness. So I pray that God, you will help us be honest with ourselves and be honest with you just the way David was and to help us to understand that our relationships are all impacted as long as we continue to lie to ourselves. We can never have authentic relationships until we deal with the stuff that's below the surface. God, I pray that we would trust you enough to be vulnerable. Lord, if there is anybody in here today who needs to accept you as Lord and Savior and begin that process of opening the door to their hearts, I pray, Lord, that today might be that day, I pray, Lord, that we might repent. If we're walking the wrong direction, even if it's so simple as to try to convince ourselves we're not broken, but we are, Lord, I pray that we would repent from that and I pray that we would stop and we would turn and we would walk in a new direction and we would walk the right direction. Lord, we know that if we are following someone who is going the wrong direction, we'll end up in the wrong place every single time. On a very simple level, Lord, if we are walking the wrong direction, we will end up in the wrong place every single time. So God, I pray, that if we need to repent—if we need to turn and change course, I pray that today would be that day. In Jesus' Name, we pray. Amen!

"I'm not sick so you can shake my hand later if you want; it has to do with this basketball team; it's their fault. This past week my kids played in the Hamilton County Freshmen Basketball Tournament and if you were here last week, you heard me talking about them and how exciting a group they are. We went into Carmel on Thursday night and did not play very well the first game of the county tournament, but we still beat them. We kind of just wore them down, like we talked about in here last week. It was tied middle of 3rd quarter and we kind of ran away from them. Then yesterday morning we played Guerin Catholic in the first game—a team that we had beaten in regular season play by 6, which was our closest game of the year actually and absolutely gave them a spanking yesterday by about 25 or 26. Then we played in the final game against Fishers in the afternoon and for a freshman boys' basketball game, it was an outstanding crowd—unbelievable—some of you were there and that was really cool except that meant I had to yell louder. And the yelling took its toll on me, so I'm going to do the best I can today and I apologize that you can't hear very well. In that Fishers game yesterday, we did lose, so ended our season 19-1 in the county championship. It was pretty devastating really. I told the kids yesterday it's a tough thing when kids go in with heavy anticipation of finishing what they had started and couldn't quite get over the hill. We were in the 2nd quarter—late in the quarter and we were dealing what seemed to be a knock-out punch to them, but physically they were bigger and stronger and really even more athletic than us in some ways, so they were able to just grind us down and eventually just finish us off. One of my really good players fouled out right toward the end of the game and he came over and he was just sobbing. As a coach it's really hard—for me, it's not the wins and losses—for me, it's those kids. They have given everything—everything—and I told them yesterday, 'I'm not holding anything back today; I'm giving you everything I got.' That's why I am in the condition I'm in today. They shook the other team's hands, and went to the locker room when it was over and they were just devastated. I had the other coaches go get them and bring them back out. Of course, they didn't want to because they were so emotional and just sobbing, but I took them to mid-court where I talked to them for a minute and then I took them over to where their parents sat. I told the parents, 'you have unbelievable kids—unbelievable kids.' Their parents clapped for them and we went back to the locker room.  Whew! It was so hard—I mean there were boys weeping. Part of it is they have had aspirations to play and I've talked to them for weeks that 'this is your last time together as a class,' because after the freshman year, they go to junior varsity and varsity and everyone is mixed together—all the different classes—and 'your teammates that you've played with since 3rd or 4th grade to 5th grade and 6th grade and 7th grade and 8th grade and now 9th grade—all the way growing up with your friends, your buddies, but this is it; it's over,' and many of them knew at that moment that their basketball careers were over because they might not make it on the roster for next year. The kids were sitting and just sobbing. One of our boys who attends church here hugged me 3 times before he left the locker room and just sobbed and said, 'Thank you for making my last year of playing basketball a great experience and fun.' Kids were broken—broken hearted at not being able to finish and not being able to do what only one team has done here in 52 years at Hamilton Heights. They thought they were going to be the 2nd and they spent it all and they were not able to accomplish it.
 
This week is a week where many people are reminded of broken hearts. Today is February 12 so in 2 days some will celebrate Valentine's Day. Sometimes those days remind us of our broken hearts. I sat with those boys yesterday with their broken hearts and I told them for me the hardest part was not even yesterday sitting there in the locker room. For me the hardest part is Monday at 2:30 p.m. when I have been getting ready to go to practice every day for 3 months and all of a sudden I don't get to go anymore. It's not about practice; it's about those young men. For me it's the relationships of those young men. Broken hearts—whether it be broken hearts from not being able to achieve goals that we want to achieve or whether it be broken hearts because of lost love and Valentine's Day not being such a fun day, but a day of brokenness because of love lost.
 
This week we are reminded about the heart; we're reminded about the heart. Now, as I've thought about that this week, and really I believe this is God's way of telling me that we need to spend more weeks—I told Heather this week--you know last week we did the mind and the body—mind and strength of the Great Commandment, and the whole idea was Jesus gave us the greatest commandment to ""love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind and with all thy strength,"" then last week was about the mind and strength and my whole talk was about when one goes, the other goes, because the mind and strength are so closely connected together, that when one goes, the other slips too, so I had said this week we're going to do the heart and the soul. The 2nd part of that greatest commandment—if we want to be able to do the Greatest Commandment like Jesus said to ""love the Lord thy God with all our heart, with all our soul, with all our mind and with all our strength,"" Satan is certainly going to attack those areas to keep us from being able to do that. So this week I told Heather, 'I just don't know about this heart and soul thing; I don't know that I can do them in a day. It's just so deep—a broken heart is just so deep that this might be a mini-series within the series,' and then as it transpired this morning, I thought there is no way I can do everything I wanted to do because of me, and so God just kind of answered the question. So this may go on for a couple more weeks.
 
But as I was thinking this week and thinking about the broken heart, I was thinking about the fact that there are really two ways our hearts are broken. There are a lot of sub ways underneath that, but there are really two ways that our hearts are broken. One of them is that someone else does it. Someone else does it. She was just 4 years old and she was standing in the backyard when her dad saw her out the window. She was standing along the fence talking to boys on the other side of the fence and she was totally naked. The boys had talked her into taking off her swimsuit—her bathing suit—and so here is this 4-year old girl standing at the fence and talking to these boys. Her father goes out, collects his daughter, which was a good thing, takes her back into the house, which is a good thing, takes her to the bathroom, puts her in the bathtub and begins to scrub her down to teach her a lesson. All the while he's doing this, he goes and gets a toothbrush so that he can clean out the hard-to-reach places. This began a cycle for this young girl—a broken heart damaged to the soul. Four years later, when she was 8 years old was the first time her father actually, truly raped her and left her in her own blood. She's now older and she talks about those stories; she talks about the stories of brokenness and she talks about the stories of how as she has gotten older and now realizes the catastrophic stuff that happened to her at a young age led her into making decisions she wouldn't have otherwise made and led to the brokenness of her heart and the brokenness of her soul. Sometimes our hearts are broken because of the things that other people do and it's not anything we did. Sometimes when we are in that situation, and statistics tell us that for the most part 1 out of every 6 young boys will be inappropriately, sexually abused by the time they're 18 years old—1 out of 6.  With girls, it's 1 out of 4. If you take those numbers and you think about all the people that are here today, there is no way it doesn't impact us—it just does! Some of my good friends have been through this very thing. When we go through these things, we tend to blame ourselves. Even though she was 4 years old and the boys had talked her into taking off her swimsuit, as she got older she still blamed herself even though it was something other people did to her, but it's really hard when it's your protector—the one that is supposed to take care of you. That's one of the ways our hearts are broken.
 
Another way our hearts are broken is because of what we do—the choices that we make. Now there are two things with that. Some of the choices we make that break our hearts we make inadvertently. It's not intentional; we didn't intentionally do it—we just make choices in life and at the time we think it's the right thing, because that's the strategy of the enemy. That's the strategy of Satan who masquerades as an angel of light; he's the master of making wrong things look right. He's the master; he's the master of making wrong things look right in helping us rationalize the things that we do that ultimately lead to the destruction of our hearts. In some ways we did it innocently because we thought it was the right thing or it felt like the right thing—the feeling—that's where he gets us a lot. He really plays with the idea 'if it feels good, then do it.' Well, you know what?—that's nowhere close to being Scriptural. Jesus never said those words, but the enemy convinces us that 'if it feels good, do it,' and it leads to the disintegration of our hearts even if it is unintentional. Every act that we take that is an inadvertent act of rebellion against God rips away a piece of the heart and leaves us in heart trauma.
 
But then there is a second way and that is just blatant acts of rebellion. There are ways our hearts are broken that we do to ourselves because of just choices we make, you know, like the choices in the Garden of Eden where we shake our fists and say, 'I'll do it my way. That's my choice. I know better than you know, God; I know better.' And many of us that have gone through those phases of our lives and those rebellious periods of time in our lives, we end up on the other side because God gets our attention, brings us back and we realize that every time we've rebelled—every time we've transgressed—every time we've shaken our fist at God, it's taken another piece of our heart, and the heart damage we have is incredible.
 
Jesus said, ""Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all of your soul, with all of your mind and with all of your strength,"" and the enemy sets out to destroy those things; if he can destroy our minds, if he can destroy our strengths, if he can destroy our hearts, and if he can destroy our souls, there is no way we can possibly love God to full capacity, so you are a target. You're a target; I'm a target.
 
In Proverbs 4:23 Solomon says (JR read it.) If I give you a verse to memorize this week, that's it. (JR repeated it.) Jesus said basically the same thing in Mark 7:21-23. (JR read it.) Jesus is saying, 'Guard your hearts,' because that's what controls what you do. You know we talk often in spiritual language about having a softened heart and not a hardened heart. We go all the way back to the Pharaoh—even God hardened Pharaoh's heart, and it didn't work out so good for Pharaoh to have a hardened heart.
 
I want to look briefly at some of the rest of that passage in Proverbs 4. (JR read Proverbs 4:1-4.) ""Take hold of my words with your heart . . . ."" In Verse 12 it says (JR read Verses 12 and 13.) The ""instruction of God is your life,"" he says. In Verse 20 it says (JR read Verses 20-23.) So what does the writer of Proverbs tell us? He tells us this: he says that your heart is the thing that controls your actions in life, and what he tells us down through there is that for our hearts to be right, we have to reach out and grab God's instruction—we have to grab God's Word. We have to take God's Word—it's not a matter of my opinion; it's not a matter of your opinion. If my opinion is not formulated under the instruction of God's Word, then it's always going to be folly. It's always going to be human wisdom; it's always going to be my own wisdom and that falls short. So what he tells us that is in order for our hearts to be right, we have to grab God's instruction and we have to grab God's Word and we have to take that and put it here (he pointed to his heart) and it's that which controls us. The writer of Psalm 119:11 says the same thing; he said 'Thy word will I hide in my heart that I might not sin against you.' That's the defense! The defense for a hardened heart is to take God's Word and to tuck it away in there.
 
Now I see an interesting play on this because I find in John 1 these words: ""In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God."" This whole idea of the Word is a person. In John 1:14 (JR read it.) So here's the thing. Y'all, I'm about done—pretty much and then we'll move into the rest of our service which is way more interactive with you today. The thing is this: it's not just taking the written Word of God and hiding it in our hearts, but it's taking the Word who became flesh and dwelt among us and hiding Him in our hearts. For those of you who have experienced brokenness, there is hope, and there are all kinds of brokenness: there is the verbal abuse that some of you experience—the verbal abuse that you experienced for the longest of times and it was a verbal manipulation which leads to emotional abuse and then it goes beyond that sometimes for some of you and it was physical abuse and the brokenness—the trail of brokenness that we have—some of your hearts have been absolutely smashed because of your relationship with family members. I mean, let's be honest; we live in a world—in a culture that has trashed the family and we've shed many a tear because of the brokenness of our families. We live in a world where our sons and our daughters have gone a different direction that we would have liked for them to go and it has broken our hearts. I can't think of anything more painful, honestly, as a father than to live out the life of the prodigal son—to see my kids live out the lives of a prodigal son, and some of you have experienced that. Some of you are experiencing that now. Some of you have experienced the prodigal son and you've experienced the coming home of the prodigal. We have people in here in different phases of life; we have some here today who will come today in this service or in the next service that wish they could go home and just have peace, but there is no peace! And the enemy wants war; he wants turmoil; he wants chaos for you because he wants to break your heart—he wants to break your spirit—he wants to break your soul—he wants to break your strength—he wants to break your mind, and he knows that if he breaks those things, you can never fulfill the Greatest Commandment to ""love the Lord they God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind and with all thy strength."" If it's broken, it just doesn't work right. The hope that we have is that Jesus is the Healer and He's the One who can put those things back together—though there may still be scars. You know some of us will always live with the battle scars of a life lived here on earth. I remember in basketball practice 12 or so years ago, taking a charge in practice—9 stitches right there (He pointed to under his nose); if the light hits it right when I look in the mirror, I can still see my scar on my lip given to me by a kid, but you know what?—that one is not a big deal compared to the ones we have to live with.
 
My basketball players—they will recover by middle of next week and then they'll be onto spring sports and they'll have good memories. Their hearts will still be broken a little bit that they weren't able to finish and be 20-0, but in the scope of the whole world, that broken heart is pretty trivial compared to experiences that people have with real life. One of the time-outs yesterday, with about 4 or 5 minutes left and we were down 8 to 10 points, my kids were fighting—they were trying so hard and during this time-out I was yelling at them—I had to yell—it wasn't negative yelling—I was yelling ""Keep fighting; keep fighting—it's worth it to keep fighting."" Then I broke into sermon mode; I really did. I started crying and I said, ""Listen, keep fighting; it's worth it because this isn't about basketball; this is about life. Life is hard and you got to fight. You have to keep going; you got to keep fighting."" And they went out and they kept fighting and I looked at my assistants and said, ""I'm crying as I broke into sermon mode.""
 
But it's so true; the enemy wants to destroy your heart, so guard it. Guard it; take care of it; don't let him have it. Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – God, thank you; God, you are good. Our hearts are broken—all of us—'for all have sinned and have fallen short of the glory of God,' and because of that we have broken hearts. God, I pray for restoration and I pray for renewal. Lord, I pray that we can be an encouragement to each other. I pray as we are sojourners along this thing we call life; Lord, I pray that we can encourage each other and we can help each other up and we can move each other along. Lord, I pray that we can be authentic; I pray that we wouldn't pretend. Lord, we are all in a state of brokenness that only you can repair. God, thank you, for what you've done for us in Jesus and it's in His Name that we pray. Amen.

"It's true that we are under siege; Satan wants to beat on us in any way he can. I'm excited whenever I see us try to counter that as people, whether it be individuals or collectively. And I'm excited that down the hall for the third Sunday is a group of men who are pursuing trying to figure out what it is that they can stand best against the enemy for themselves, for their families, and for God.
 
It was in 1959 that Vernon Howell was born in Houston, TX. His dad had run off so he never met or knew him so his mom raised him basically alone although she lived with a man who was an alcoholic, not just an alcoholic, but an abusive alcoholic, so he grew up in a terrible, terrible environment. He was bullied all through school; he was picked on and singled out. He dropped out of school his junior year. Time went on and at 22 years old he got a 15-year old girl pregnant—obviously that wasn't a good thing for his life. At the age of 29 he was acquitted for the attempted murder of George Roden. As Vernon Howell stood before the jury, he convinced them that he was just shooting at a tree and that he wasn't shooting at the guy that was ducked down behind the tree. Life had been a crazy adventure for Vernon Howell, but at the age of 34, on February 28, 1993, he became a household name. It wasn't Vernon Howell that you knew; he had changed his name over the course of years to David Koresh. On February 28, 1993, the ATF raided the compound that Koresh was running in Waco, TX. On that day, many of us remember, watching basically on live television 4 ATF agents died and 6 of the Davidians within the compound also died. That day led to a 51-day siege that again many of us remember watching on TV day after day after day the pictures of the Waco compound and all of the military equipment that surrounded it. Surrounding them by day, they would smash Davidian cars in order to mentally torment the people inside. By night they would flash lights on and off continually and they would blare all different kinds of music loudly with the intent of creating mental and physical duress. The whole purpose was to cut them off, to isolate them, and to lessen their resistance. On April 19, 1993, our U.S. Attorney General, Janet Reno, ordered the sending in of troops, to go and put teargas into the building. She was going on the information that the children inside were being abused, both mentally and physically—sexually—those things were found out later to be false, but under the best information she had, she ordered the teargas to be shot into the building. They had audio tapes that had been sent in inside milk cartons when they had given them milk as a gesture of keeping communication open, but inside those they had hidden microphones so as to hear what the Davidians were saying. They had recorded that the people inside were talking about spreading—about pouring out liquids and things so that when the compound went up, it would go up in flames and erupt quickly. We watched—America watched—as the compound went up in flames that day and 80+ people died, at least 22 being under the age of 18 years of age.
 
Siege—I don't believe that that siege by the U.S. Government was intended to end in death; I don't think that was the purpose. Other people may feel differently but I believe the siege was to try to get the thing resolved, but nevertheless, a siege is the surrounding, the cutting off, the isolation, and the lessening of resistance of people. That's the point of it. A lot of times that's the mental duress and/or the physical duress. Satan's tactics for you are that very thing—to engage you in other stuff that isolates you, that cuts you off, that lessens your resistance, so that he can have his way in your life.
 
When asked the question 'What is the greatest commandment?'--as Jesus was under siege by the Scribes, by the Pharisees, by the Sadducees, they tried to pin Him down and said, 'Of all the 613 laws in the Scriptures, which one is the most important? Which one is the greatest commandment?' to which Jesus said, 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' In Mark 12:30 Jesus says that's the greatest commandment. The greatest thing that mankind can do is to 'love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength,'—that's the greatest thing a person can do and if that's top priority on Jesus' list, doesn't it seem to reason that Satan would attack us in our hearts, in our souls, in our minds and in our strengths? Doesn't that seem logical that those would be areas of target because if the greatest thing we can do is to love the Lord with all of our hearts, souls, minds and strengths, doesn't he win victory if he hammers away at those areas and wins in those areas?
 
Today I want to talk about mind and strength; I want that to be our focus and we'll get to heart and soul next week. Our minds and our strengths are interconnected. Really, I think all 4 of these things are interconnected but our minds and strengths are so connected. My freshman basketball team—two weeks ago, we went to Zionsville and I knew it was going to be a difficult task. We won 2 games yesterday and at this point we stand on a season 17-0. We've had a great year and it's been a blast, but recently we went to Zionsville and I knew it was going to be tough because I had seen them play earlier; they have a 6'9"" kid and I don't have anyone even close to 6'9""—I had gone to see them play McCutcheon and I was thinking 'Oh, my goodness, 6'9""—I would just kick him in the knee. How am I supposed to coach against this?—stand on his feet so he can't jump—grab his jersey so he can't move,' but really as I watched, I realized it's not the 6'9"" guy that will be the problem—it's the 6'4"" and 6'5"" guys standing behind him who will really be the problem, because I don't have anyone close to 6'4"" or 6'5"" and if we give all our attention to the 6'9"" guy, guess what the 6'4"" and 6'5"" guys will do? They will do whatever they want! So it's like a coach's nightmare—these match-ups that don't match up very well. But the one thing my team has and it's out of 28 years of coaching freshman basketball, this is the fastest team I've ever had! We can really run, so what I told my guys was 'Make 6'9"" guy a track star! Let's make him a cross country runner. The 6'4"" and 6'5"" guys—they don't want to run either. So we're going to run, run, run, run—we're going to run.' That's our game—we run—they're a fun team to watch—they just run and run. I told them, 'you think we haven't run in a game before?—tonight, boys, we are going to run like crazy. So you have to wear them out; you have to wear them down,' and what I told them was, 'I don't know what you'll wear out first—I don't know if it will be their minds or their bodies, but as soon as we get one, we'll get the other.' That's what I told them. I said, 'As soon as we get one, we'll get the other.' And so we get to halftime, and we're down—we're down 5 or 6—it's not going so well. So I tell them at halftime, 'you just have to keep running; trust me, you have to keep running; keep running, keep running, keep running.' Two minutes to go in the 3rd quarter, we're down 10. The guys are running by the bench looking at me, saying, 'we're running, coach; we're running.' In a timeout I told them, 'Trust me, just keep running; just keep running. I don't know which will go first, their minds or their bodies, but once one goes, we got the other one. Once they break down mentally from mental fatigue, the physical follows, or if they get physically tired, the mental follows—it just will.'  And then it happened! We kept them running, and all of a sudden ""pass—steal—lay-up!"" You could see their frustration immediately—they had played basically perfectly to this point. They bring the ball up again and you could see it; one of their guys tried to do something he hadn't done the entire game—guess what?—mental breakdown.  Guess what?—""steal, lay-up."" Then another steal; another lay-up. With two minutes to go in the game, we get a steal and I think we were up 3 or 4 points at that time and we get another steal—one of my kids has it and he's coming right by the bench and I know what he's thinking and I am wanting really badly to yell ""Noooooooo; don't do it!"" but I didn't. I let him go and he goes down and just hammers a dunk. Now I was wanting to scream ""no"" because he had one dunk in his entire life up to this point and we really needed the basket but at the same time I thought 'he's never going to learn to do it if he doesn't do it.' So I didn't say anything and he just hammered it and as soon as he did, it was ""game over."" Zionsville guys shoulders' sagged; I mean their coach called 3 time-outs within about a 45 or 50-second span trying to stop the tidal wave, but once it starts coming—once the mental breakdown happens, or the physical, they both follow each other, and it was amazing to watch these guys who are all 5'7"", 5'8"", 5'9"", 5'10"" and their 6'9"" guy's tongue hanging out like a necktie coming down the floor as he can't keep up. Their coach didn't actually play him all that much because the coach had to get him out because he couldn't keep up so after the game I shake 6'9"" guy's hand and said, 'Gunner, nice job, you're going to be a good player; keep working.' He said, 'I don't know why Coach wouldn't play me.' I just winked at him and said, 'Keep working,' but I was thinking, 'because you're not a track star; that's why he didn't play you.'
 
The enemy will hammer and hammer and hammer and hammer on you until you break, and when it comes to the mental or physical, he knows that those things are so connected that once one goes, the other one goes. With that basketball game, I knew that once they made a couple bad passes they would get frustrated and lose concentration, and when they lose concentration on what they are supposed to be doing in their minds, we had them right where we wanted them. I also knew that if they got tired—so tired, maybe they are still mentally there, but so tired that they would throw something weak that they would normally throw crisp, we'll get it. And once we get it, the mental would start to go, and I know they are so connected together—that's the battle of coaching—not just in athletics, but in life. The battle of coaching in life is to keep the mental and the physical both healthy and both going the right direction and to keep them strong. The bottom line, and I don't even have to tell you this—you know this—Americans are worn out! Americans are worn out! We are physically and mentally exhausted! I read survey and study after study this week that up to 80% of Americans suffer daily with chronic fatigue and they don't even know it. We battle it every day just to stay awake and a lot of times we don't realize we're tired. You know the thing is what's hard in coaching a basketball game is as a coach you can see it slipping and you can tell them, but they don't get it; they don't understand. The 6'9"" guy doesn't realize he can't keep up; he's trying his best but he doesn't realize because of the fact that he gets tired, he can't keep up that they're playing 4 on 5 and it puts them at a huge disadvantage but he doesn't understand that. I'm not criticizing him; that's the human life. So often so many of us, we're tired, we're worn out and we don't even realize it. You know, what would America do if God came down this week and supernaturally zapped away all caffeine? Some of you right now are going, 'God forbid!' 'JR, get behind me, Satan.' Just think about that—why is there such caffeine overload in America? It's an indicator a lot of times—now let me say I love sweet tea, but caffeine really doesn't do anything to me. I'm the guy that can drink a gallon of sweet tea and then go to bed and sleep. For me, it's not a stimulant in the same way; but, my wife, if she drinks caffeine after 6 o'clock in the evening, she's awake at 2 a.m. It just impacts her differently. But a lot of Americans feed off of that, you know; we have to get up in the morning and in order to wake up we need the caffeine. Why is that? Because we wake up in the morning and we're still exhausted. We're still tired! And Satan knows that when he can hammer away and you are not at your best, physically and mentally, you cannot fulfill the Great Commandment the way God wants. But we often don't think about it that way, do we? We don't realize how important rest is in order to be able to love God with all of our hearts, with all of our souls, with all of our minds and with all of our strength. You see we think it's great to burn on fumes until we go up in flames.
 
Sports injuries today—I've heard doctors say it, and there has been a huge thing on this in probably the last 10 years—there are tons of sports injuries today in kids that are linked to overuse. You know when most of us were kids and we were involved in athletics and it was fall, we played football. We went out in the backyard and we played football and then when winter came, we played basketball. We would do different stuff and now it's different because the people who play basketball play from March to March. And if you happen to play baseball, they play from March to March and if you play football, you're doing football stuff from March to March. If you're a 3-sport athlete, it is off-the-charts crazy what we are doing to our children and we wonder why our kids' bodies are breaking down. I heard Damon Bailey in an interview later where he said, 'by the time I got to Indiana University, my legs were just gone,' and then after he graduated from there, he tried to go to the Pacers and had knee surgery after knee surgery after knee surgery and they asked him, 'what would you do differently?' And he said, 'If I were to go back and relive my basketball career,'—maybe he was the most storied basketball player in the State of Indiana history; you know we all watched him as a high school kid and as an 8th grade player, Coach Knight told his players at IU that there was no one on his team that was better than an 8th grader down in Heltonville, IN and we watched him take his Bedford North Lawrence team to the state finals 3 out of 4 years and watched him win a state final his senior year in front of 40,000 people at that time in the Hoosier Dome—I was sitting in there and it absolutely was one of the most unbelievable things, seeing that one kid play so well, but they asked him 'what would you do differently if you could go back?' And he answered, 'I would take time off.' That was the one thing in the particular interview I watched; that was the one thing: If you could go back and do anything differently in your basketball career?—and he said, talking about his teen-age years, ""I would have taken time off because all I did was play and now I can't even play.""
 
It's the same thing on a spiritual level. Satan will convince us that we are ""invincible,"" and that we can go and we can go and we can go and go and go and before you know it, he has us in his snare. When we are worn out, we are susceptible. In sports when you're tired and you quit playing hard, that's when you're most susceptible to injuries. In spiritual life when you're too fatigued to go hard and play right, you're more susceptible. When is it that you're susceptible? When is it that you get frustrated? When is it that you're tired?  I'll tell you some days are a killer for me. I am mentally and emotionally on--Sundays kill me, as much as I love it, it just tears me up. By 12:30 or so, out here on the couches, I'm spent—I mean, you guys ask me questions and I am tongue tied. I just am—just mentally spent, because by that time I've already been here since 5:30 a.m. so I've been here about 7 hours by the time we get to 12:30 and that time is all mental, emotional and spiritual preparation trying to hear God so that I can give you what I believe God is trying to say, and this is the killer for me on Sundays and it's kind of a joke in our family where we were talking about this just a couple of nights ago. When we get into the car, and I always try to talk Shanna into riding with her mother, because when I go out and get in the car, I usually just go down to McDonalds and go down there and sit and think about nothing. We'll go down there and it's kind of funny because it's usually just Leigh Ann, Shanna and I and we'll be sitting there and after about 5 minutes LA will go, 'Well, you're really exciting today,' (because I'm just kind of silently sitting there) but I always try to talk Shanna into riding with her mom because I know what's coming if she rides with me. I mean there was this one week—it was the first time we ever said anything about it—we got in my car here, pull out of this lot, and before we got to Casey's, I think Shanna had asked me 7 questions. And the questions my daughter asks are not—'Do you want to go to McDonalds? ""Yes,""—they are not yes or no questions. The questions that she asks take hours to answer even if I could answer them, and I say that as a credit to her because she comes to church on Sunday mornings and God works and probes her mind and her heart and she comes out of here with questions and that one day before we got to Casey's she was just firing question after question after question that if you could answer one of them and could write a book, you'd be a millionaire. So I finally just said, ""Just stooppp."" And she is looking at me with surprise on her face, 'Really, stop?'  I said, 'Don't say anything else to me; I just lost my mind.' It's a good thing she's a daddy's girl; it's a good thing we're pretty tight and it's a good thing she's big on forgiveness.
 
I'm just telling you that when you're tired and when you're worn out, that's when you are susceptible and you're susceptible to respond to people in ways that aren't right. I'm wanting to answer her questions; I just can't, probably because I'm not smart enough and I'm just done—I'm spent. So sometimes we say things in ways that we shouldn't. When you get tired; when you are in those moments—whether it's mental overload or physical—we've all been there. Think about that—when you are just so mentally exhausted from whatever physically your body, you just want to go out and run? Not most of the time—when you are so mentally exhausted, normally you just want to lay in a chair and veg and when you are so physically exhausted, that isn't the normal time you want to sit down and read, study, or stimulate your mind because it's so connected.
 
In Mark 6 we have a lesson about this kind of stuff from the life of Jesus.  Mark 6 starts with this whole idea of a prophet who is without honor in his hometown and Jesus is talking about how He is rejected in Nazareth, but then just a few verses later, starting in Verse 6 Jesus sends out the 12 and I referenced this last week from another one of the Gospels when Jesus sends out the 12 and He basically gave them instructions on how to avoid being taken by siege. In this Gospel of Mark, it doesn't talk about it but in Matthew that I referred to last week, He does. He said, 'Don't fear the one who can destroy just the body, but fear the one who can destroy both the soul and the body.' It was in this context of Jesus sending out the 12; (JR began reading Mark 6:7-13.) I'm telling you this was a mentally and physically taxing thing that He asked them to do. 'I'm asking you to leave your families; (not leave them as in divorce or leave them behind) but here for a time, I'm asking you to leave them and to go out and pair up and I want you to go about the work of a mission. I want you to go out and tell people about me; tell them the Messiah is here,' and He says, 'You're going to be rejected because when they don't accept you, shake the dust off your sandals and move on when you leave as a testimony against them.' He says there is going to be controversy, and He tells them in that other Gospel, 'Do not fear the one who can destroy just your body . . . .' Why would He tell them that? Because 'there are going to be some out there who are going to oppose you and want to kill you and maybe just like in Nazareth take you and throw you over the cliff' like they tried to do to Jesus. Can we not see how that could be mentally and physically exhausting? And at night, they didn't stay in the Holiday Inn Express with a hot tub downstairs next to the work-out room where you can go and chill. You know, a lot of times they probably just slept out on the ground or wherever. I know what some of y'all's idea of camping is; I'm sorry but that ain't camping like in the days of Jesus. It was having a blanket and a rock for a pillow and hopefully the fire burns long enough to keep you warm for a few hours of sleep.
 
Following this or during this time we find starting in Verses 14 through 29 that Jesus' cousin, John the Baptist was beheaded. He has been taken to prison, he has been wrongfully accused, and he has had his head cut off because of his faith in Jesus. Now think about this; you're out with your buddy—you and another are paired up out there trying to do the work of Jesus and you hear that John the Baptist just got his head cut off because of his faith in Jesus, what's the first thing you're going to think? Zip up the collar—protect the neck, because I might be next. Don't you think this is mentally and physically exhausting?  But Jesus says in this Commandment to 'love your Lord with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, with all your strength.' That's the greatest thing that we can do. So we get to Verse 30 of Mark 6; it says (JR read Verses 30-33.) He modeled ministry but He also modeled seclusion. How many times do we read in the Gospels that it says that He retreated from the people and went to rest?
 
Now a part of His rest was prayer. Part of His rest was drawing away from people to connect to God. That's the same thing that we need if we're going to live out the Greatest Commandment to love God with all of our hearts, with all of our souls, with all of our minds, and with all of our strength, you cannot do that if you are exhausted all of the time. We can't do that at full capacity. But you know when we try to rest what happens? Try to rest when you have a 2-year old! Sometimes it just doesn't work, does it? And when we finally sit down to rest, we think we're going to get some rest and then something happens—the phone rings—there's a knock at the door—life happens! But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't still do it. Look what happens: (JR re-read Verses 31-32.) Jesus knew that sometimes you have to go to extremes to get rest. (JR continued reading Verse 33.) Now picture this; He gets in a boat, sets out onto the Sea of Galilee, where the people see them and they are running around the lakeshore and when they get to the other side, there are the people waiting, but at least Jesus knew they would have time away in the boat.
 
Some people would say 'we just need quality, not quantity' but you know what?—we need both. Sometimes you have to settle for just quality and what you can get in the moment, but we need to schedule both quality and quantity rest time. We don't do any family or friends any good if we can't live out what God has called us to do, to 'love your God with all of your heart, with all of your strength, with all of your mind, with all of your soul'—with all those things; if we can't do that because we're tired, then we're not doing a good service to those around us.  Out of all the 10 Commandments, God said what? ""Remember Shabbat."" It's the only commandment He told us to remember. Let me rephrase that a little bit differently—remember to rest. Now I could go a long ways into what is that rest—what is that Sabbath rest? I think Jesus modeled that—I already told you that when Jesus went away to rest, He prayed. His rest included communion and connection with God. It's not just checking out and going to sleep necessarily, although that is important, but rest is two-fold. It's about shutting down our bodies and sleeping, but it's also about connecting with God. That's what Shabbat is; that's what true Sabbath rest is. God said ""Remember the Sabbath Day."" God has given you one day of the week to where, without any guilty conscience, you can take it and do nothing. There are many who would say, 'Whew, I would like to have some of that.' It's not 'I would like to have that;' it's that God said, 'Remember to do that.' God said, 'Remember to do that,' and JR says 'I don't think I need to do that,' so what did JR just say? JR says he is smarter than God. JR is uncomfortable with that, but isn't that what I say? If God says, 'Make sure you do this,' and I say, 'I don't need to,' is America good at taking Shabbat? Are we good at 'resting in God?' Look around; you tell me.
 
Jesus said this: ""Come to me all you who are weary, and I will give you rest."" He didn't say 'Go to bed, all you who are weary,' although I believe those are connected. He said, ""Come to me . . . ."" Anybody in here ever gone to sleep praying and you kind of feel guilty because it happens every night? I have had people over the years tell me that—'I try to pray before I go to bed and I feel so badly because I fall asleep. I feel like I'm betraying God somehow in that.' Anybody in here hold your child at night when they are young and they are talking to you and they fall asleep mid-sentence? Did you ground them? Were you mad? Were you offended or were you happy to cherish that moment? Think about it as a father or as a mother; what more could a Father want for His children all over the planet than to lie down every night and fall asleep talking to Him? Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – God, we are tired, as a country, as a people—as a culture, we are tired. We need rest—not just sleep that we need, but we need to rest in you. God I pray that we would understand that; I pray that we understand that we are under siege because Satan knows that as long as he can keep us busy and he's kind of helped us buy into this thought that the busier you are, the more holy you are. Really, that's not the Biblical pattern; it's good to be busy and it's good to work hard and those are all Scriptural things but it's also Scriptural to rest. So God I pray that you help us fill out and live out that Great Commandment to love you with all of our hearts, souls, minds, and strength, and help us to understand that in order to do that we need to be obedient in rest. God, I thank you that we find our rest in the Risen Savior, the One who conquered the grave, who showed the world that He is not subject to worldly things, but that His life is out of this world. God, I pray that we would find our rest in Jesus. Lord, thank you, and it is in His Name we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",2/5/2017,
"The American dream—it is something we all would like to have; the American dream, whatever it is that is our dream—you know, it's been sculpted and fashioned in different ways, but in some form or another it's the ownership of a home which would include a dog—that would include kids—that would include a fence, a white picket fence, and as time passes maybe it's like a really tall fence to keep our neighbors out. The American dream is fun; the American dream is fulfillment—the American dream is children's chores and homework being done; the American dream is no stress; the American dream is baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet or Ford (whatever you want) and IU.  The American dream can be boiled down, really if you get through all of the stuff, to security—to security—we just want to be secure. We want to be secure, because with security comes safety, and with safety comes peace, and that's what so many of us desire; we just want some security. We want some peace. There has been a lot of talk over the last several weeks and months and even in the last few days about peace and security, about building walls or not building walls, about letting people in or not letting people in and both sides of the argument on any of those has to do with our security, in some way, shape or form or the security of others. And Americans will argue it and fight it and there are good people on both sides of all of those issues that have good arguments on both sides of all of those issues but it's about security. Again, it's where we want to be as people and individuals and the way we frame it and what is our American dream and what does that mean and how can I have peace—how can we have peace?
 
The life of a follower of Jesus—we need to understand that Satan wants to lay siege to our security. He wants to lay siege to our security—to any security you have in your life, he wants to lay siege to that because security to us leads to peace and brings about a peace and God wants us to have a presence of peace in our lives but the enemy doesn't, so he will strip away anything he can that has to do with our security in order to ruffle our feathers so that he can bring about a lack of peace in our lives. From the beginning of the Bible to the end we find people who struggled with security. Adam was banished from the Garden, the place where God was present with him—Adam was banished, and all the way to the very end of the Bible in the book of Revelation we find the Apostle John where?—he was stuck on the island of Patmos, which was a slave island where he was a prisoner and there were people in between such as Daniel, the Great Prophet, who was uprooted from his family by the armies of Nebuchadnezzar and he was taken away into Babylon. As a young teenage boy, all of the security he would know in life was stripped away.
 
We have Job; I've talked about Job the last few weeks and it was interesting in my studies, not necessarily looking for anything, but found in Job 31:24-28 where Job made a comment about his own security. He said this to his friends: (JR read the passage.) Job says that if his faith—if his trust—if his security came from the great amounts of riches that he had amassed then he would be guilty of sin, because that's not where real security comes from. Because just like in the life of Job as we saw, that can all be stripped away in the snap of a finger and can be gone. Just ask those who were pilfered by Bernie Madoff—people who lost their entire savings, their entire retirement—their entire security in the blink of an eye. We, as people, we need to be like Job. We need to be locked into God—locked into God as our security, and that the security we have in life doesn't come from outside sources.
 
In Taiz, Yemen—it is Yemen's third largest city—they have been under a massive war for the last several years. They have been under siege and it has been brutal. I was reading about that city this week and it's a kind of civil/religious war; there is all kinds of stuff going on that the city has been decimated—the third largest city in that country has been decimated—totally decimated. There is a man named Qays that lives there. He said he is used to the danger; he is used to slipping through the alleys and going in via the back ways because there are snipers everywhere and they shoot everything that moves including dogs or cats or anything. It doesn't matter what side you're on—he said you just slip down through the alleys and stay really close to the walls and if you have family with you, you duck and try the best you can to be safe, but there is really no security. There are very few provisions because the snipers are so bad that no one can get in to bring relief. It's just a place filled with misery. One day not long ago as he was walking with his son and daughter down one of those alleys, he didn't hear the sound of the bullet until it had already gone through the chest of his son. (A picture of the 6-year old boy was shown on the screen at the back of the stage.) This is his 6-year old son; this is a picture of a 6-year old little boy who was walking with his father and sister, trying to get from Point A to Point B and his life was taken. Qays said this about the loss of his son: ""The sniper aimed at my son but he really shot me in the heart."" When the boy's mother found out, she ran to the place where he had fallen, where the blood was still on the ground and she fell to her knees and she wailed and wept.
 
Where do we find our security? Is it in our family? Is it in our children? Is it in our parents? Is it in our relationships? Where do we find our security?--in a place like Taiz, Yemen,--Qays says there is no security, that there is nowhere you can go and be safe. The enemy wants to lay siege to our security to lessen our resistance. The enemy wants to lay siege to our security to lessen our resistance so that our trust in the Father will wane. That's the desire—the desire of the snipers in Taiz, Yemen, is to do the same; it is to totally beat down the people to where they have no hope and that's pretty much the case with the news coming out of there—it's pretty much the case.
 
So just know this, friends, that the adversary who wants to steal, kill, and destroy, according to John 10—he wants to target your security. We've talked different areas—different things, over the last few weeks, but security is a big one. Security is a big one because with security like I said earlier, with security comes peace and we want peace; we want that lack of chaos in our lives. We just crave the dog inside that white picket fence playing with our kids, who have done their chores and homework. We want that peace but Satan knows that if he can just disrupt that, that he might lessen your resistance.
So where is it that you get your security? Where is it that you find your peace? Is it in the safety of your job?—is it in the walls of the school where you're with your friends?—is it your monthly, or every six months, or every four months or whenever you look at your statement to see what you have in your retirement fund so that you know you are okay? Where is it?
 
We spoke last week about David. I spoke about a friendship—about a relationship last week that Satan wants to hammer away at the relationships in our lives because if he can strip those away and if he can isolate us and make us lonely, he's at an advantage. You remember back in those days of Dick the Bruiser and wrestling?—not I'm not talking about today's wrestling—I'm talking about real wrestling back with Dick the Bruiser because it was real then, not fake like today. But remember when they would do the tag team thing where one would be fighting and getting pummeled and he would be trying to reach for his partner to tag and come to relieve him? Then they would finally get a tag and the other guy would come in and he would pulverize the other side and then they would go through the same thing.  If Satan can alienate you from being able to get a tag to get relief, from being able to get someone to come in to help you, he knows that your resistance is only so strong that you can only stand so long by yourself or at least that is what he supposes. We've seen those in the wrestling ring—they would get soooo close to getting a tag and then what happens?—someone would yank him and slide him back across the mat so there would be no hope of a tag-in and there would be no relief to come. Spiritually it is the same thing. If you draw security from your relationships, it's not a bad thing; I shared last week that we are created for relationships—God created us to have relationships, but just know that Satan is trying to drag you across the ring so you can't tag to where there is a connection.
 
We talked about David and Jonathan; Jonathan was the son of Saul who was the King and David had been anointed to be the King, but Satan had gotten inside of Saul and Saul had turned against David and wanted to kill him and David told Jonathan, the son of Saul; he told him 'He's going to kill me,' but Jonathan didn't think so. So they did a test and Saul threw a spear at his own son Jonathan in his anger about David so Jonathan said, 'Yeah, I guess he is going to kill you.' And it began a journey for David leaving the King's palace—leaving a place of safety and journey out into southern Israel into the Judean wilderness and into the Negev Desert and into some of the most barren places that they could ever find. David would go through the deep ravines and he would find literally a hole in the wall of a small cave and he would hide in there so that Saul couldn't find him because he had no security. He had a small band of men with him to try and protect him, but David had been taken away from his family and there was no more Jonathan. Though David had been anointed King, he was a King without a Kingdom. He was a King on the run. Life for David was not what he had pictured. Life for David was not the American-Israeli dream. When Samuel told him he was set forth to be King, I can't imagine that this was what his vision was. I can't imagine that he thought he was going to be running day after day after day for his life. That's not what a King does.
 
David penned these words in Psalm 142. He said: (JR read the chapter.) And he also says in the first 3 verses of Psalm 27, (JR read them.) Remember every time we read the word ""salvation"" in the Old Testament, it is the Hebrew word ""Yeshua"" which is the Greek word or the English translation for ""Jesus.""  David says 'Even though they try to besiege me, and war breaks out against me, I will be confident; I will be secure; I will be okay.'  What two different pictures we have in his life! One where he is confident no matter how difficult things get because everything will be okay and then the next picture shows him in desperation because the King of Israel is seeking the to-be King of Israel in order to kill him. David was human and he looked around and he saw the absence of security and he struggled, but I believe as we read through the Psalms that he always came back to that picture of 'No matter what happens, I'll be okay as long as I'm attached to my Maker. No matter how bad things get, no matter how much dust is on the horizon from the hooves of the horses of the ones who are coming to take my life, no matter how much of that I see, life is okay as long as I'm connected to God,' because life goes beyond this world.
 
One of the reasons I believe we struggle so much with security is because we have fastened ourselves to the wrong things. Our security will always be shaky when it is built upon the things of this world order. John the Apostle said 'Do not love the world or anything in the world. If you love the world or the things of this world, the love of the Father is not in you. The world and its desires pass away.' We cling so tightly to this world—we cling so hard, I mean we will fight like crazy to keep ahold of these things and what the Scriptures tell us is that 'there is life beyond this,' not that this life isn't important, because it is. Jesus was a Jew and the Jewish life shows they went to great pains to make sure that life in this world was cherished. So I'm not lessening or demeaning life on this side, but it's not the only life. We have to understand that in God's eyes and in the blink of His eyes, we may go from this side to the other side and for us and those left behind, that is a huge change, but for God it's all the same, because when He sees you now if you are in a relationship with Him and if you are connected to His Son, Jesus, you have afterlife. When does the Scripture say that eternal life begins? Jesus said in John 17:3 that 'eternal life begins the moment we come into a relationship with Him.' Eternal life doesn't begin after I die. According to Jesus, He says 'Eternal life is knowing God and His Son whom He sent.' So if you're in that relationship, you've already started on that journey of eternity. The only difference is that some of us tend to grasp and find our security in the things of the flesh on this side of it—on this side. That's not where your real security lies.
 
In Matthew 10 Jesus gives a talk about personal security. He takes His disciples and He's going to send them out. He's sending them out into the world; He's sending them out into Israel and He's telling them to go and to teach and to preach and along with that He gives them a talk on personal security. He tells them what to take, what not to take, all the provisions, all the stuff and what they are supposed to do, how they're supposed to react and at one point He says this: (JR read Matthew 10:28.) What He is saying is this: 'Don't be afraid of the adversary because all he can do is inflict pain on your physical security—that's it! He has limitations'--just like in the life of Job. We don't like that—we say if God really loves us, why didn't He take all that away?' and we forget that mankind chose that route. We forget to take personal responsibility and understand 'For the wages of sin is death,' that we chose a life of rebellion as mankind and that God by His Grace gives us an escape to a future because of the death of His Son.
He gives us the promise of security that we do not deserve. The Apostle Paul said this: He said, 'Your citizenship is in Heaven and not of this world.' It's an eternal thing; it's a futuristic thing. The Apostle Peter said it this way: He said, 'If we are people who are truly walking with Jesus, that in this world we are aliens and strangers that we walk around and we don't really fit.' And because we don't really fit, guess what?—our personal security might be a little bit of a struggle at times, in the world sense of security. Jesus said, 'If you love me, your life will be totally peaceful and you won't have any problems. And this is the way you know people love me because their lives are perfect and they don't have any problems.' No! Jesus said the exact opposite of that! He said, 'For those who follow me and love me, understand that the world will hate you because they hated me first.' Your security in this world—of this world order—will be disrupted because of your relationship with God, but your true security is fastened to a Man who was fastened to a Cross.  Your real security is that these momentary struggles are temporary. Again, that's what the Apostle Paul says, that the things that we struggle with now are temporary and we talked a couple weeks ago about the physical part of it and there are so many in here who are struggling on the physical side of it. We've had prayer requests—people who are dealing with cancer and from people who are dealing with different aspects of life that are so difficult and if that's where our hope is—if that's where our security comes from—from our physical perfection, from our physical health, then we are in trouble because in a moment that can be all erased, but that's not where our security comes from. Our security comes from trusting in the man who was fastened to a tree who died a criminal's death in my place and who on the 3rd day walked out of a tomb to show that this world order has no hold on Him, and it is in Him that I place my trust. It is in Him that I get my security. It's not in the absence of war; it's not in the absence of turmoil; it's not in the absence of a lack of money to pay bills—my security comes from knowing that He holds my eternity in His Hand through the relationship that I have with His Son, Jesus. And you can have that same thing! You can't earn it; you can't earn your own security because He has already earned that for you. You can't be good enough, because they are letting me in, and I'm not good enough. It's not about what you do; it's about what He's done. It's about who you trust. Will you trust Him today? Do you trust Him today with your security in the midst of your turmoil? Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – God, thank you; thank you for our struggles in this world because they refine us as people. We don't like 'em. I'm not thanking you because I like it; I'm thanking you because of what it does for me and for us as individuals. As the Apostle James says, 'It brings us to maturity.' Lord, I thank you for the opportunity we have to struggle in your name, and Lord, there have been so many who have been under siege over the last several months and there is more coming. Lord, I just pray that you speak into us and help us to understand that no matter how unsettled we get in this physical world, that this physical world on this side of it is not our destination. This is a temporary pit stop. God, I pray that we will trust in that and I pray that we will surrender ourselves to you and Lord, that we seek you in prayer and that we pray over our friends and that we pray over people we don't even know. God, there may be some in here today who need to place their faith in you for the first time and get security from you for the first time. Lord, I pray that if that's the case, there are people here today who are ready to die to themselves, to be buried in a tomb of the Mikvah of baptism, to be born again, to be raised to new life. Lord, only you know and it is by your Spirit that you probe our hearts. Lord, may we listen and may we respond; I pray again this morning for that roomful of men down there. Lord, I pray that same thing is happening this week and I pray that when they walk out of there, that it is the same impact where there are people ready to walk into a confessional. Lord, take us, mold us, make us into the people you have called us to be. These things we pray in Jesus' Name, Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",1/29/2017,
"John Pemberton had hold up in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He was born in the North but had joined the Confederacy. He had married a Southern woman and because of that he had joined the Confederacy and was now in charge of a large army of the South. He was in Vicksburg along the Mississippi River and was determined to hold on to that portion of the river so the South would continue to control that because it was so important for their future. He had already held off two large assaults from General Ulysses S. Grant who was determined to take Vicksburg. They went head to head and two different times John Pemberton was able to hold him off so U.S. Grant decided that he would just lay siege to the city, and so he did. This whole idea that we've talked about for the last two or three weeks—this whole idea of cutting off, of isolating, separating someone from the things they need began to happen; 46 days later, after General Grant had laid siege to the city, on July 4, 1863, John Pemberton surrendered the city. He surrendered and turned over 2,166 Southern Confederacy officers to the Union Army. He surrendered 27, 230 men, 172 cannons, and he surrendered 60,000 muskets and rifles. It was a huge, huge turning point in the Civil War as the North—the Union—got control of the Mississippi River and it happened because General Grant laid siege—he cut off everything. When John Pemberton surrendered, his men were trashed; I mean they were starving and in no condition to fight and actually Pemberton set lots of them free because he wanted people to see how emaciated they were—how bad they were; he hoped it would send a message to the rest of the South that the North was going to win.
 
Being under siege is painful; being under siege is for the purpose of destruction—it's for the purpose of annihilation. Last week we talked about how Satan seeks an opportune time—this we've gone back three or four weeks on that when Jesus fought the temptations from Satan head to head, that Satan left Him and left waiting for a more opportune time to come back and lay assault or try to lay siege, even to the life of Jesus.
 
Last week we talked about physical ailments and how sometimes Satan will try and attack our person; he will sometimes try and attack our physical bodies and we saw in the book of Job where that actually happened, where God will sometimes stand back and allow Satan that opportunity. Why?—we don't know. I would have loved to be able to stand here last week and talk about all the why's that God does things but the scriptures are really clear that man doesn't have the mind of God and God doesn't have the mind of man. His wisdom is way beyond that of ours and we don't understand the why's that He does everything but we do see there are times that God will step back and He allows us to go through things as His children. Sometimes we can be quick to say 'Well, that's not very fair; why would God stand back and allow His child to be hurt when He knows they're going to be hurt and when He knows there is going to be pain?' The same thing can be said about us as parents. When we put our kid on a bicycle for the first time and we know at some point they are going to probably crash; we know that. Well, then, why do we let them do it? Why do we allow that? Why do we extend those things to our kids? My point in that is sometimes we hold God to standards that we ourselves don't live by. We back God in the corner and say 'If God really loves us He wouldn't allow that,' but we really love our kids and we allow those things. I also said last week that all physical ailments—everything that we battle—isn't satanic in nature directly; it's not a direct assault the way Job took it, but it is a ""yes"" and ""no."" No, because not every physical ailment we undergo is directly from Satan but yes every physical ailment we go through is directly from Satan. When you track it back to Genesis 3 of the Bible in the Garden of Eden where mankind decided that we would shake our fist at God and go on our own, we put ourselves under a curse and that in itself is satanic. And because of that, we have brought disease into the world so every time I suffer some physical ailment, it's not that God said, 'Okay, I'm going to take my hands off JR and you can do anything you want to his physical body, except kill him,' like He allowed with Job, but it may be just through some of the natural causes, but my point in this today is this, as I want to jump into our next thing, is physical ailments are not always directly from Satan in that hands on thing, but he will certainly use them; he will certainly use them. If I contract some disease just through the natural course of life, it may not have been directly caused by Satan, but he's going to use it. He's going to use my situation to try to isolate me from family, to try to isolate me from friends, and try to isolate me from my trust in God. When we hear those words ""cancer"" or any of those dreadful words that we hear, immediately Satan tries to use that and even if he didn't cause it, he's going to try to use that to whisper in our ears that 'God doesn't really care about you; if God really cared about you, none of these things would happen.' So we have these voices that go through our minds.
 
As I talked about physical ailment last week and how he wants to lay us under siege in that, the Civil War is a picture of broken relationships.  Maybe no more clear a picture in America that can be painted of this thing of broken relationships and friendships than the Civil War—I mean that's what it was all about. And this week as I read and looked at stories it was absolutely astounding to me the stories I found. I came across the story of Wesley Culp and Jack Skelly who grew up together in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, until one of their jobs they were working at went South and Wesley Culp went with the job and he had lived there a little while and then things within America started to fall apart and so they end up on two different sides—kids who ran around on their farms together, growing up and exploring and living life together, end up on the same battlefields later in life.  We can read the stories of brothers who were split; families who were split—as a matter of fact, Wesley Culp's brother said that 'If Wesley ever showed his face back around their farm in Gettysburg, they would personally shoot him and take care of him.' That didn't end up happening, but at one point that was the statement that was made.
 
John Pemberton, who I spoke of earlier, was in control of Vicksburg and tried to keep it from falling was roommates and best friends at West Point with George Meade, who was one of the big players for the Union at Gettysburg. I think sometimes we forget that multiple people who were trained at West Point and were best friends ended up on two different sides of this battle.
 
Satan has amazing ways of isolating. Satan has amazing ways of laying siege and there is probably not a more pronounced way he could destroy our relationships with God than to destroy our human relationships because mankind has been created with the need for relationships. That's why Genesis 3 is so painful because the primary relationship that we need is the one with our Creator. We were designed to have a relationship with God and in Genesis 3 that exploded. It was severed; the umbilical cord was cut and we were unable to receive nourishment from the primary relationship we need. Because we were created for relationships we see that there in the Garden that God said 'Man should not be alone.' God made someone so that he would have companionship, so that He would have a partner so that there would be relationships because God knows that He created us for relationships. So one of the ways in which, and I believe one of the primary ways that Satan knows that he can destroy our relationship with God is to destroy our relationships.
 
In Ecclesiastes 4 Solomon, the writer of Ecclesiastes, knows and understands the critical nature of this relationship—this companionship we should have. He said, (JR read Chapter 4, starting in Verse 7- 12.) ""A cord of three strands is not easily broken."" Relationships are critical, Solomon says. Relationships help keep you warm when you're cold, and you can take that a lot further than just physical warmth. I mean how many times in life have we experienced coldness just in life and a friend walks along side to bring warmth and to give us hope, to say what?—'It's going to be okay.'
 
Therein is the problem! We want relationships but betrayal is as painful as anything we experience because of broken trust. In the life of relationships betrayal is the worst. We pre-date the Civil War and go back to the Revolutionary War and if I would tell you that I had a son and named him Benedict Arnold Moffatt, you would say 'You named him what?' You would walk away shaking your head thinking 'Why would you name your son Benedict Arnold Moffatt?' Because Benedict Arnold is known as what?—as a betrayer—one who sold out to the British—one who was willing to turn over people that he said that he loved and had actually at one point he had fought for. Betrayal is so painful because betrayal never comes from an enemy. Ponder that thought a little bit. Betrayal never comes from an enemy because if it's coming from an enemy, it's just an assault. Betrayal is that whole idea that you thought there was something but there's really not--if it's an enemy, you know there's nothing there so it's not a betrayal, but that's why someone like Benedict Arnold, if his names still resonates 200 + years later amongst Americans, you know maybe not with the same intensity that it did back in that day but can you imagine 20 years later if I had named my son Benedict Arnold Moffatt to all of those who I'm looking around and if you were in that group 20 years after in that time frame and you have family members who died in the Revolutionary War and gave your lives of your family and now I name my son that, it might ring a little differently and it might feel a little differently. Betrayal never comes from the enemy. And Satan wants to use betrayal. Satan wants to use that as one of the ways that he lays siege. He knows that if he can weave his way into relationships—into the lives of people who are close to us and can create some sort of betrayal, he knows it's a successful way to lay siege.
 
What happens when we experience betrayal? The natural human reaction when we experience betrayal is that we begin to isolate; we cut off friends. We start to cut off people. You don't have any idea how many people and you've probably met some, too, if you've had deep conversations with people and I have, through the course of what I do, have had a lot of these and it's amazing; it's astounding to me how many people over the years have told me, 'Yeah, I really don't trust people.' 'Why don't you trust people?' Sometimes the answer is 'I don't know; I'm not really sure.' Then we talk a little bit more and they are really sure; they just weren't cognizant of it; it's because someone at some point in time has been a Benedict Arnold. Most always it's because someone betrayed us, and when we are betrayed, it is an opportunity to lay siege because then when we have that lack of trust, we close ourselves off and we hold ourselves up in Vicksburg and we create our own siege in a sense, so I'm not going to let anyone else in, and that seems like a very protective thing on the outside. I can't get hurt if I isolate myself and protect myself from this; if I'm not in these relationships and I don't trust people then my trust isn't going to be broken, but the problem with that is God says for us to be healthy, He has created us with the need for relationships. So Satan, in a backdoor way, tricks us into thinking we can be healthy through isolation when in reality, God says 'You were created for relationships.'
 
It's hard; Job's friends in Job 16 accused him of being evil. Remember last week, his wife said what?—'Why are you still holding onto your dignity? Just curse God and die. What are you doing?' And in several chapters later his friends, who had sat there quietly for 7 days and in the end of Chapter 2 last week that I read, his friends came and sat with him for 7 days and didn't say a word and I talked about how they started out good and they started out being comforting but by Chapter 16 they were saying about the same things as his wife, 'Well there must be some hidden sin in your life or some hidden evil in your life,' and it's actually kind of funny because later Job talks to his friends and he accuses them and says, 'You guys are miserable comforters,'—that's what he called them. As good as they started out they get to the point where he calls them 'miserable comforters,' and then you get to Job 42 and there it says that 'God was angry with the friends.' God was angry with the friends because they misrepresented Him—not misrepresented Job, but misrepresented God. 
 
Now what is the point in all of this? The point is that for us, we need relationships. We were created for relationships. Satan will try to lay siege to our relationships; he will try to get us to isolate ourselves by getting people in our lives who will break our trust and through that whole thought of isolating ourselves and not having those deep relationships we think we're protecting ourselves when we're really hurting ourselves and so in order to have those relationships, it is important that we find people who are connected to God. Why do you think the Scriptures from the beginning to the end talk about not being unequally yoked with non-believers? I mean this can go really, really deep and I don't have time to take it really deep today but this goes to the very core of who we are. Satan wants to use people who masquerade as Christians. I literally have had and seen situations where a girl wants to get married but she doesn't want to marry this guy who is not a Christian. So he agrees to go get baptized so that he can marry the girl. I've seen these situations. Most of the ones I've seen haven't been local; they've been friends in other places. So guess what happens to the marriage eventually because it wasn't built on the right thing; it was built on a fabricated storyline as in 'I trust God,' but he didn't really trust God; he just wanted to marry the girl. The damage that is inflicted by those kinds of things—I did take a young lady—it's been a while now—to lunch in Noblesville a few years ago and I had known her for quite a while and I told her, 'I don't think you should go through with this.' I said, 'I've never had this conversation with anyone before, but I'm telling you, I just don't think you should go through with this.' She said, 'He will change.' Now after we have fast forwarded into the future today, that relationship was over years ago. It didn't hardly last any time at all and the devastation that takes place in people's lives and their broken trust because of that, this is why we have to be really sure that people who we are closest to are connected to God. Does that mean they're perfect? Does that mean things won't ever go wrong? No, it doesn't because Satan is waiting for a more opportune time for those people, too. God wants to align us with people in our lives who have common vision—it doesn't mean we should isolate ourselves from all the rest of the world because who would reach out to the rest of the world if we don't ever talk to them? But our closest most intimate friends, if we want to be in the safety of relationships the way God has designed it, should have like mindedness in who God is—in who God is and where we are going with Him. Does it mean that if you're in a relationship that is not like that, maybe it is a marriage relationship—does it mean there is no hope? No! Does it mean you should bail on that relationship because that's not the situation? No! I would never promote that. What I would promote at that point is that you be in fervent prayer with God bringing people together to be like minded and following Jesus, but knowing that Satan is going to try and use those things to divide. He just is; he's going to use those things to divide.
 
I was recently watching some TV show and I don't remember the name of it, but I was watching it with Leigh Ann and Zac—it was on the History Channel and it's about these people who are training for Navy Seals type stuff and they are challenging the people and eliminating some and it's really exciting as they show this really tough stuff they have to go through. I think when we were watching they had gotten down to about 5 and then they did this military exercise where they were to go out and they were assigned individually to go to each station where they were to do 50 of these things and then go to another station and do 50 of something else and continue on to the various stations to keep doing 50 more of other activities and they were told 'don't cheat; you are on your own honor to fulfill the program.' But they were being videoed and they didn't know it. One guy when he went to one station, instead of doing 50 of that particular exercise, he did only 48. And man, the conversation he had with the guy in charge was really brutal. He sat and sobbed and bawled and the whole idea was 'Those guys don't trust you anymore; you are the leader of these 5 and now they don't trust you anymore. You have broken that relationship; you have severed that; how could you ever go into battle or lead them anywhere if they don't know if you will be honorable?' And then he ended it with this; he said, 'Later this afternoon I'm taking you out and this time you're going to do 50; you're going to do them and then this will be water under the bridge and between you and me it will all be cleared up. I don't know how the others will feel but you're going to do them.' Later they show them laying there in the barracks and the man in charge comes in and says 'someone in here owes me 50 so let's go.' So the guy starts getting ready and the other guys don't really know what's going on so they start putting their gear on as well and the guy who was guilty said, 'Look, he's talking to me so this is about me and not about you,' but before it was over those other guys got in their full gear and they all did it with him. They all went through the pain and the struggle together. When I was sitting there watching it, to me it was a beautiful picture of relationships; it was a beautiful picture of restoration of guys that were willing to suffer for another person's fault. You could see the humility on the face of the guy who was guilty after it was over as he goes around and was thanking each of those guys; he was trying to emotionally hold it together and one by one, guys were hugging him saying 'Look man, don't worry about it; we're a team!'
 
That's the type of community; that's the type of bond God had put us in the world to have and to enjoy. And that's the type of bond that the Christian community should be in light of our service to Jesus. But rather than letting that guy go out there and the others bringing their guns out and shooting him as he did the exercises, which is often times the way the church community responds to people who fail, the picture of grace is to walk alongside him and to suffer--for something you're not responsible for, that's the picture of Jesus. This whole idea of relationships—it's hard because we can't control others. It's easy to sit and think 'Yeah, I'd have these relationships; the problem, though, isn't my desire to have these relationships; the problem is I can't control other people for them to have the same desire.'  That's the truth; it takes two or it takes three or whatever and we can't control other people, but we can determine what kind of friend we will be and we can model that. We don't have any control over what other people do but we do have control over the decisions that we make. 
 
In 1 Samuel 16 Samuel anoints David to be the next King of Israel. Samuel anoints David to be the next King of Israel while there is a king sitting on the throne. In 1 Samuel 17 we have the story of David and Goliath--where the king sitting on the throne won't go and fight the battle the way the king should as a leader and young David goes and fights the enemy. In 1 Samuel 18 we find that Saul, the sitting King, has a growing fear of David. In 1 Samuel 19 we find that Saul tries to kill David, the one who has been anointed. And we get to 1 Samuel 20 which has been taught for years and it should because it is one of the most beautiful friendship chapters of the Bible—the story of David and Jonathan—Jonathan, the son of the sitting king. Jonathan being the son of the sitting king should be the one who is heir to the throne and he has befriended David and they are friends—tight friends—but David is a little bit skeptical. He's a bit skeptical because he knows that Saul is trying to kill him but yet here is Jonathan who is befriending him so he thinks, 'Should I trust him?' Now, if you think about this, it is very valid because if you're David, you have been anointed to be King but here is Saul who is currently the King with his son, Jonathan, who is the one waiting in line to be King. If you have a relationship with Jonathan, it would be very easy to distrust him because he might just want to 'knock me off' because Samuel has anointed David to 'take my seat.' David tells Jonathan that 'this is dangerous territory,' and Jonathan says, 'No, I don't really think my dad wants to hurt you.' And David thinks, 'Yeah, he really does.' So they devise this plan and I encourage you to read this chapter this week and I'm going to now read some snippets of it, about 6 or 7 verses. They devise this plan on how Jonathan will discover whether or not his dad (Saul) was really trying to kill David so I'll start in 1 Samuel 20:28. (JR read Verses 28-29.) 'So David isn't here today, so he asked me if he could go and I told him it was fine.' In Verse 30 it says (JR read Verses 30-31.)  In other words he is laying that very seed of what I said. 'As long as David is here, you will never be the king. How can you not figure this out?' (JR then read the end of Verse 31-33.) That might be the understatement of several books of the Bible right there. His dad picks up a spear and throws it at his son because he is so enraged over this whole David thing but this story is beautiful; the beauty of this story is that Jonathan is so faithful to David. And there is a lot of symbolism in here where Jonathan intentionally gives up every claim to the throne he has—that the world would say that it's his, but Jonathan turns it over and gives it to his friend.
 
Relationships are critical; Satan is going to try to sabotage them; if things are good right now, just wait because he's waiting for a more opportune time, either for you or for that person you trust. He's waiting for a more opportune time so that he can get himself in the middle of a situation so that he can break trust in your life so that you isolate yourselves so that you don't extend forgiveness. There is an amazing thing that happened with Job. In Job 42 when I told you God was angry at Job's friends, God told Job to pray for them and when Job did, it says, ""Then God blessed Job."" It was only at the point where Job extended forgiveness to his friends and reached out to rebuild that relationship spiritually that God blessed Job with twice as much as he had before. You see the picture of relationships in this world is going to be the picture of brokenness. You can't avoid it; it's going to be the picture of brokenness and every one of us, no matter how close we are maybe even to the person we're sitting next to today—they may be the best friend we have in the world but there have been times where our feelings have been hurt, where things have been said and when we say things with the wrong attitude, with the wrong tone, with the wrong intent, with the wrong meaning, those words hurt people and that is broken trust. I'm not talking about going and having another relationship with somebody, you know the magnified broken trust within the marriage relationship, but it's impossible to live as humans today and not have brokenness within our relationships—the question is do we have Jesus as the center of our lives to where there is restoration in those relationships? In that show that I mentioned earlier, it could have been down to 4 guys, just like that! But those other guys reached out and said, 'Look, we will go through this with you.' How this show will end up in future episodes, I have no idea but at this moment, the relationship thing that was going on was really cool.
 
Pray for discernment; pray God gives you discernment on what is true and what isn't in your relationships. I had two high school girls come to me years ago when I was in youth ministry and they remain close friends of mine even to this day. They came to me and told me they were struggling with relationships—struggling to keep their faith—struggling to do the right thing because their friends were trying to lead them in wrong directions. So I was sitting and talking to these girls who were in tears and I told them it was about focusing on these friends and trying to introduce them to Jesus. This is like 30 minutes into the conversation and I'm talking to them about trying to introduce these friends to Jesus and they stopped me and said, 'No, wait a minute; we're talking about our Christian friends. They are the ones who are making it hard for us to live like Jesus.' It wasn't necessarily other kids that went to church with them; it was just kids that they knew in the community who professed Jesus who didn't live Jesus. For these two teenage girls it was really hard for them to wrap their minds around how these Christians were making it hard for them to live like Jesus. That can be a deal breaker for people. Pray for discernment! Jesus said 'Everyone who claims that we're hanging out aren't people I'm hanging out with. Everyone who claims my name isn't someone connected to my name.' And that whole thing about betrayal.  I don't believe that I will name my son Judas Iscariot Moffatt either. I realize Iscariot wasn't his last name; it was the place where he was from, but you understand the picture. If I were to introduce my son to you as Judas Iscariot Moffatt, you would be walking away thinking 'Why didn't he just name him Benedict Arnold?'
 
Betrayal is painful; the restoration of Jesus is beautiful!  Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Lord, we know that you desire relationships with us and I know the enemy desires to lay siege to cut off all the things we need in life in order to isolate us so that our defenses become low and so that we give up. God, there have been many times you've done that through some of the closest relationships with people that are in this room. People in this room have experienced this where it's some of the closest relationships they've had that have hurt them deeply. Lord, it has sometimes inflicted permanent damage in our lives and sometimes it has kept us from pursuing other relationships even a relationship with you. God I pray we will see those and we will work through them and I pray that we would understand that forgiveness comes through Jesus, that the reason He came, that the reason He gave His life on a cross—the reason He died is because of the brokenness of relationships. That is it; that is the reason—it is restoration. Lord, I pray for those of us who have a Civil War going on within our family, Lord, we can't control other people but we can control us. We can determine our steps and I pray we take the right steps and that you lead us in them. Lord, I pray that we would trust you even if it's hard.  I pray we would trust you no matter the result or the outcome of the situations. Lord, I thank you for Jesus being the example of one who came and trusted even though He knew the trust would be broken. Lord, heal our hearts and make us stronger through faith and trust in you. Lord, if there is anyone today who needs to take that step to trust you as Lord and Savior, I pray, Lord, today would be a day of restoration of relationships. It's these things we pray in Jesus' Name. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",1/22/2017,
"In 1343, there were tensions in the city of Tana between Italian Christians and Muslim Mongols and it became violent leading to the death of one Muslim. It led to the evacuation of the city's Italian Christians and they fled to a city called Kaffa where they were given sanctuary. When the Mongols eventually chased them down, the civilians in Kaffa refused to let them in; it was a fortified city—a walled city—and so the Mongols, being outside the city and the Italian Christians on the inside decided to lay siege. So from 1345 to 1346 the Mongol Army lay siege to the city of Kaffa waiting for the Italian Christians to come out. During that time the Mongol Army was inflicted with the disease of Black Death; it swept through their troops. Unsure of exactly how to handle this and wanting the people on the inside to suffer the same plight, they took the diseased dead bodies of their comrades and put them on catapults and they launched them into the middle of the city in hopes the disease would spread to the Italian Christians on the inside. This was the first that I could find recollection of biological warfare, so to speak. Launching rotting human corpses, and that was one of the things when I was reading was they would wait a lot of times until the corpses deteriorated into really bad conditions so that when they landed, ---- yeah! A vicious enemy—a ruthless enemy—the real enemy wasn't the Mongol Army—the real enemy is Satan. When I say the real enemy, he is the enemy of everyone; he is no friend of man; he is no friend of any man.
 
Satan has put us under siege; he has put us under siege and has surrounded us and has tried to cut us off from essential supplies. He is trying to isolate us in order to sever all of the arteries that would give us hope in order to lessen our resistance. Today I want to ask the question as to whether or not Satan and all of his craftiness can attack the body. And I don't mean the body as in the body of believers, but I mean the body as the physical fleshly body in which you reside. I want to ask the question: Can Satan attack our bodies? Is that one of the ways that he can lay siege to us? Can he come after us in that way? 
 
In Job 2—that's where we'll begin to answer this question. In Job 1 Satan approaches God and he asks to sift Job; he asks to attack Job and God says 'you can but you can't touch him;' throughout the course of Chapter 1 Job's property is demolished, his family is destroyed—all but his wife; Satan lays siege to him but in Job 1:22 it says (JR read it.)  Then in Job 2:1 it says (JR read Verses 1-2 then pausing to continue commenting.)  And we can add to that from the last couple of weeks 'looking for a more opportune time for some of us.' (JR then read Verses 3-13.)  Again, I ask the question: Is it possible for Satan to be able to attack my physical body? Is it possible for Satan to be able to attack your physical body? I believe scripturally it is absolutely possible! But I believe the correct answer to that is yes and no. Yes and no, in the sense that does all sickness mean that it is a satanic attack? Is all sickness a satanic attack? Well, yes and no! Yes and no! What do I mean by that? Let's look at John 9. In John 9 we have a story of Jesus. During His ministry it says: (JR read John 9:1-3.) In other words the blindness this guy is experiencing is kind of just a part of the normal cycle of life. There wasn't any sin—there wasn't anything directly attributed that caused this; we could go over to Chapter 11:1-4 and there is another same-type story. (JR read it.) 
 
Why do we suffer? Why do we suffer? Let me see the hands of anybody in here who has had some type of disease impact your life whether it's you or somebody that you know—family member or friend. It's pretty much to a person, isn't it? It's pretty much to a person. The body is a tool; it's a tool—it's a tent—it's what God gave us—it's a place that houses our soul; it is a vessel that is to be used to bring glory to God. All through Scripture it talks about how God wants us to use our bodies to bring glory and honor to Him, so why would we not suppose that Satan would want to attack that? Why wouldn't we just assume that Satan wants to attack our bodies? Jesus addressed this. He addressed it on multiple occasions when He said things like this: ""Don't fear the one who can destroy your body but not your soul."" I mean there are going to be attacks; we've talked about it. It's not because Satan hates us so much; it's because Satan hates God so much and because God sees you as precious, Satan sees you as a victim of the attack. No, I don't believe that every sickness that befalls a man is an intentional satanic attack like the book of Job. I don't believe that every single time we come under something that it's been because Satan has been petitioning God to take His grip and His protection off your lives so that he can attack you knowing that eventually you would break and that you would curse God. I don't believe every single time that's the case, but I believe that it's possible and often times that's the case. But the answer is yes also that every spiritual attack is satanic in nature; I believe that it is a yes and no—No, not every single thing I go through is directly from Satan coming to attack me, coming to strike me with boils so I would sit under a tree and moan to myself and take a piece of pottery and scrape the scabs off so that the pus spills out on the ground like Job did. But every affliction that we go through is a satanic attack because its origin is in Genesis 3. Its origin is in Genesis 3 where Satan convinced us to go it alone—where Satan convinced mankind that we could do better without His involvement—not Satan's involvement, but without God's involvement. It was at that time that mankind was deceived and we started a journey to which we suffer the consequences. And every one of us live in that world where consequences are suffered. When I asked 'Have you been affected by disease? Have you been affected by physical affliction?'—every one of our hands are going to go up and it's all rooted in that Genesis 3 encounter because 'of this sin, you shall surely die'—physically! Spiritually die—two totally different things, but we have to go back to the mindset and remember that God created Adam and Eve; He didn't create them to die, but He created them to live forever. That's why the redemption of mankind means God will redeem us so that we will be in a ""living forever"" state. Not every attack that we suffer physically is directly an assault personally from Satan to us, but every attack that we face is directly an assault from Satan to us. All of us have had to deal with the brokenness of physical sickness.
 
The top 10 causes of death in America—8 of them are disease. #1 = heart; #2 = cancer; #3 = respiratory. You get down the list a little ways and then you find one that climbs in which is ""accidents""—it's a non-medical thing in the sense of disease and then #10 is another one and it's suicide. And what they don't say in there, but I would assume, is that even sometimes suicide is done because of disease—things people are facing, but they don't want to face, so to some degree I would say 8 ½ of the top 10 reasons are the curse that mankind is under and accidents would fall into that, too. Death is a result of brokenness with God. It is an assault on who we are! 
 
And I look to the faith of Job. I look to the faith of Job as I try to wrestle through this whole question and there have been so many of you in here who I know a lot or even a little bit of your stories; some of you are just started out on these journeys in recent months and I see the roller coaster. I see that one day there is hope and the next day it is very, very gloomy. And we always want to have hope but then I look and I think 'What do we do during those times? Where is it that we turn? What is it that we grab? And do we grab anything?' I'm so blessed by some of the stories that I hear; it's hard and as difficult as it was, I was so blessed by Carl Schnaufer's story. And I mean the story that he spoke in his last months with the persistence of hope and faith and trust and the goodness of God. And I see Job. I hear those stories—those stories of hope and I see the story of Job and in the story of Job I see a man under siege. I see a man who is attacked; his family is destroyed—his kids are destroyed and I see the collapse of his home; his life is turned upside down. Satan goes before God again and says 'Oh, that man Job, he is a man of faith but he'll be faithful as long as you don't let me touch him, but as soon as you let me yank his finger nails off, it will be all different,' so God says, 'Alright, you can have your way; you can do whatever but you can't kill him.' So he just persists and goes down the road of torture. Satan goes down the road of torture, just making Job as physically miserable as he can possibly make him to which all Job does is praise God. So Satan himself lays Job under siege physically but that isn't working, so Satan does what?—he turns his wife against him. The one that Job is closest to and the best thing she can come up with is 'Why are you holding onto your dignity and your character? Why don't you just curse God and die?' And then I'll put some other words in there—'Obviously, God is mad at you and He doesn't love you. Obviously you have done something to offend Him—you know there are all kinds of things behind that so why don't you just curse God and die?' To which Job responds, (and this is a Moffatt paraphrase), 'Have you lost your mind? Should we not accept the bad from God if we accept the good?' Now, let me throw some more words in there. Job is saying, 'Who is it that we think we are? We chose to rebel; we chose Genesis 3; mankind chose to shake their fist at God and we would expect that we spit in His face and kick Him in the teeth we would expect that He would only give us good things?' Job is saying, 'Look, I'm a sinful man,'--though he was a righteous man declared by God, more righteous than anyone around, he was still a sinner; he wasn't the Savior. He wasn't the one who was going to hang on a cross because he was perfect. He was saying, 'I know what I deserve. And how can I pin God into that corner where I just accept good in the physical realm from Him?' I think Job saw further than this, too, though. I think he was beyond where we are because so often times we get so caught up in the physical—we are so stuck in the physical realm like 'this is all there is.' And I think that Job saw with God's eyes that God doesn't see time the way we see it; we see here; we see birth—we see life—we see death and what we see, it ends. Sometimes we live like that thinking that's all that there is. But God doesn't see us just as fleshly beings; He sees us for who we are and that is ""spirit beings"" because we are made in His image and God is Spirit; He is not flesh; He is Spirit and God knows for the one who trusts Him that life continues; even that blip—that moment our physical life on earth ends doesn't mean anything to God in a sense of us not existing. Satan used Job's wife to try to lay siege to him.  Initially Job's friends were good; they were right on target; they came and sat with Job and they wept with him but they didn't say a word for 7 days—they just sat and they cried and they mourned over his brokenness—this man had lost everything. In other words, what do you say? I have people that will often ask me 'I need to go down and see so-and-so, but I don't know what to say—what do you say?' What do you think you're going to say? Do you think they think you have magic words? They know you don't have magic words. It took me awhile to realize this because when you're the pastor, you're supposed to have magic words, right? At least that's what you think—you're supposed to be able to say something to make things better and I realized early on that there is nothing I can say that's going to make anything better. And out of the gate Job's friends were awesome; they just sat with him—they didn't say anything, but just sat with him and just loved him, but then time moved on. Time moved on and Satan used his friends to try to put him under siege because they, too, were just hammering him away; they hammered away on him with questions: 'Why would you keep your faith; why would you still praise God?'—same questions as his wife asked, but Job was persistent.  Job was persistent and he looked toward restoration; he looked toward redemption. His mindset was 'I may sit here with scabs all over my body for the rest of my life, but I will do so with dignity and I will do so with faith and when I pass from that time, it will instantly get better.' Yes, Job's wife and friends were used by Satan to surround, to cut off all essential supplies, to isolate him and to lessen his resistance so that he would, in fact, not trust God.
 
Now we still ask the question 'Why does God allow this? Why does God allow suffering?' That's a good question. That's a good question and if you could resolve that and you could put that into 200 pages, you'd have an instant best seller because mankind has wrestled with this for a long time. Why does God allow someone to be stricken with lung cancer and yet has never smoked a day in their life but someone who has smoked all their life for whatever reason, doesn't develop lung cancer. It's not fair! Why is it that someone has just a few drinks and for whatever reason genetically it was passed down that they become addicted to alcohol quickly? But others seem to not have that problem. It's not fair! Why is it that some are stricken with illnesses and then receive healing, whether it be through the medical world and treatments or through unexplainable healing?—like some of you sitting in here have had unexplained healing. Oh, I know we can explain it; I'm talking from a medical perspective unexplained. Why is it that God heals some and not others? All I can do is go back to those first 3 verses of John 9 and the first 4 verses of John 11. Those words that 'the work of God might be displayed in him and that God's Son be glorified.' Whatever path God lays out for my life I have to trust that it is so that God's work might be displayed for people to see and that God's Son might be glorified. If I contract a disease, and whether or not God heals me and allows people to see the power of God as a physician says 'I have no explanation for it,' or whether or not they see my dignity and faith just like Job had, even all the way to the point of death, like my friend Carl had, that God's Son might be glorified.
 
This week as I was thinking about this subject, I was thinking about someone who is in the process of being diagnosed with something that could very well be fatal; it's someone I've known longer, I think, than anybody in this room other than maybe Troy. I've known some of you for a long time. And I know that through this situation, as it evolves, God will be glorified because I know those roots of faith run deep.
 
The roots of Job—to be able to stand in the fire and proclaim the goodness of Jesus. As I've thought about that this week—these situations—I've thought it's maybe the greatest act of faith that God could ever place before us is the opportunity to give Him glory when things are not going well physically when there is a struggle for life. It doesn't mean that we're not human; it doesn't mean that we don't struggle; it doesn't mean that we're not angry. It doesn't mean that we're not confused; it doesn't mean that we're not grief-stricken, but in the midst of all of those moments, where do we turn? Do we turn and grab faith or do we curse God and die?
 
In the coming weeks we're going to incorporate into this series, ""Under Siege,"" in some way, shape, or form up here on these stage steps, we are just going to invite you to come and write prayer requests. This can happen during our services—anytime during the services, whether I'm talking or whether we're singing, whether we're taking communion, but when God lays something on your heart and you want to come and you want to write a prayer request, you can write that prayer request and place it in some kind of container we will have up here. Obviously these are public because at the same time during our services we want to invite you to come up and if you want to check those prayer requests and pray over them during our services, we want you to do that. You don't have to come to pray over the prayer request; you can come if you have personal things you want to pray about. I'm telling you now, if I am up here speaking and you have something you want to pray about, you can come up and get on your knees and you won't bother me. You'll get a whole lot more benefit out of you and Him talking than me talking and I'm not offended by that—I'm encouraged by that.
 
On February 12, which is a tentative date now, so elders, jot this down in the back of your minds, as we talked about it at our meeting on Monday night, but on February 12 we're going to do something we haven't done in a while; we're going to have our elders in here at some point during the services and we're going to just ask you to go and let them pray over you—just let them pray over you. As the spiritual leaders of our congregation, just let them pray over you--God knows what you need.
 
So what happens as a result of all of this brokenness?—the physical battles, the struggles that we have.  In 1 Peter 2:24, the Apostle Peter says this: (JR read it.) ""By His wounds, you have been healed."" When I read that this week, I was thinking you know the agony that we suffer as humans who have rebelled against God and gone through so much grief, it is through that same agony that God heals us through His Son. And in 1 Corinthians 15:50-55 it says: (JR read it.) And that would be the final conclusion to the life of a man like Job. ""Where, oh Death, is your victory? Where, oh Death, is your sting?"" You lose!  He wins!  Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – God, there is a lot about life that we don't understand and one of those is our battle in the physical realm. Lord, the battle in the physical realm often plays its way into the spiritual realm into our souls. Lord that would be Satan's goal to lay siege to us in the body so that our souls reject you. God I pray that you would help us have those roots that run deep like Job, that Lord, no matter what adversity we face, that we know that your Son, Jesus, faced even more. Lord, may we trust Him; may we trust Him in life and may we trust Him in death. Lord, I thank you so much for the victories I have been able to bear testimony in people's lives as they've struggled for physical life but gained so much spiritual ground. God, all those seeds from people's lives who have remained faithful and have been planted in others that have been left behind, Lord, I pray that you would water those seeds, so the day of Resurrection would be a beautiful harvest. God, I pray for those in here who struggle and some that are struggling now and those who will be struggling later on this year that don't know it yet. Lord, I pray that you prepare us and that you fix our eyes on Jesus, the Author and the Perfector of our faith and Lord that it be in Him that we trust. Lord, I pray that if there is anyone in here today who needs to turn to Jesus—who needs to surrender life to Him so that He can be the manager of our souls, Lord, I pray that today might be a day of salvation as we surrender. Lord, I pray that we might die in a watery grave and be born through water again a second time by your Spirit. These things we pray in Jesus' Name. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",1/15/2017,
"I'm starting a new series today called ""Under Siege,""—I don't know how long it will last, but we'll see how it evolves. I would love to hear your testimonies if you want to send them to me or to Heather about the attacks you have experienced and how God has brought you through them. I don't know that we'll use all of them; I don't know if we'll use any of them, but a lot of times it just helps motivate me and give me direction.
 
Around 600 B.C. on both sides of that, we'll go a little bit before and a little bit after, but Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon was in the process of building his kingdom and it was a kingdom that he built. I mean it was a fabulous kingdom—some would say he was a wicked man, so how fabulous could it be?—but it was fabulous because God, through a vision, defined Nebuchadnezzar and his Babylonian kingdom as the head of gold of a statue, and the representation of that as we learned in the kingdoms that followed is that Nebuchadnezzar achieved a status unknown to mankind, really within humanity apart from Jesus and His Kingdom. But Nebuchadnezzar was building his kingdom and there was nothing that was more the stamp of his kingdom than Babylon itself—not just the kingdom, but the city of Babylon. And I don't have time to go into it—I've done it in past messages describing how enormous this city was—how beautiful this city was—how on the edge this city was—how modern for its day this city was. It may be known for its Hanging Gardens or the Gardens of Nebuchadnezzar was one of the stamps on that, but it was a fortified city built right on the Euphrates River; its walls were enormous, so big in fact that they could drive chariots around the top of them. It was impenetrable; it was immovable and we find in Daniel 4 the story about how Nebuchadnezzar had gone up onto the rooftops and he looked out over the city and he was just blown away at his majesty! He was blown away at his greatness! He looked over the city and he just oozed about 'what a great and awesome place this is' and the fact that 'I've done it.' He thought he had done it and we find confrontation in that between him and God. This story doesn't evolve well for Nebuchadnezzar because of his pride—because of his pride God makes him lose his mind. But this is the type of thing that sometimes becomes issue for mankind—the things that we do, the things that we put our hands on, because it's really easy all of a sudden to look in the mirror and see how great we are rather than what God is able to do through us.
 
As Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom advanced in age, Nebuchadnezzar was eventually removed from power; he lost power and gave over to his son Evil-Merodach, who then gave over to his son, Nabonidus, who then gave power to his son, Belshazzar. So it was the great grandson of Nebuchadnezzar that I want to talk about today—Belshazzar. We could spend time turning over all kinds of stones and we could see how the pride of man is passed down generationally and how if I don't have my priorities right and I hand the baton to my son and my son hands it to his son and right on down the line.
 
Today we come to Daniel in Daniel 5 in the story of Belshazzar, but before we get to that, I want to tell you what's going on in the life of Babylon during this time. You see Cyrus, the King of the Persians, had already started his move against the Babylonian kingdom. Over the course of the last several years under the leadership of Darius, the Medes had started to make their move upon the Babylonian kingdom. The Medes and the Persians eventually joined forces; there were some big battles that had been waged; there were some large battles that were fought outside of the City of Babylon, out on the plains and Cyrus was putting his stake in the ground as Cyrus the Persian was winning battle after battle after battle after battle; this supremacy that Nebuchadnezzar had established with his nation of Babylon as symbolized in the great city of Babylon was losing its grip, and Cyrus was on the move and the Babylonians retreated. The Babylonians had retreated and basically had gotten themselves locked into the city of Babylon. They went to their fortified place of protection—the place where the walls could not be penetrated—the place where they had perfect security. Babylon was such a perfectly secure place that you could lay siege to the City of Babylon but it would not work because they had built it on the Euphrates River and because it was such a great river, they had water and because they had water, they had life. And then we come to Daniel 5.
 
With all of this going on outside the walls it said this: (JR read Daniel 5:1-2.) These are the articles that were captured by Nebuchadnezzar when Nebuchadnezzar went in 605 B.C. and 586 B.C. and destroyed the land of Israel and took the articles back to Babylon. (JR resumed reading Verses 3-4.) How much more could one spit in the face of God than to take those articles that had been deemed holy and set apart for specific use and turned them around to use them in the worship of false Babylonian moon gods. (JR continued reading Verses 5-6.) God seemed to be saying 'Enough is enough.' The pride and the arrogance of Nebuchadnezzar had made its way down to his son and was passed onto his grandson and is now taking up permanent residence in the heart of his great-grandson. Belshazzar sees what has happened and he calls out, 'Is there anyone in this kingdom that can tell me what these words mean? They are written in a language that I don't understand. Is there anyone who can tell me?' Then the queen mother comes and says, 'There is one and his name is Daniel. It's not a new thing for Daniel. Daniel is still here; he was taken captive some 70 years ago by your great grandfather.' She tells him to 'go find Daniel and he'll be able to tell you. He can give you the information that you need.' So Belshazzar calls Daniel and he says this in Verse 16. (JR read that verse.) And then Daniel answered the King and said, 'You can keep your gifts and stick 'em.' Now, wait a minute. That's not exactly what Daniel said. He actually said, (JR read Verse 17.) Now, in parentheses, that other way is the way I read it, because Daniel is taking a stand and he's saying, 'I'm not going there; you're not going to use me in bribery.' Then Daniel goes back and tells him the story of his great grandfather; he says (JR read Verses 19-21.) Then in Verse 22 he tells him, (JR read that verse.)  So Daniel said, 'I will tell you what the dream means,' and in Verses 26-28 he tells him this: (JR read Verses 26-30.) You see what Belshazzar did? He didn't know what was going on outside the walls. He had been under siege and had been driven into the City of Babylon. He hadn't been able to go and do as he pleased. His territory had shrunk and shrunk and shrunk and shrunk and what he didn't realize was that all the time he was holed up inside the walls of Babylon was that Cyrus, the Persian, had a plan, and on that very night, he executed his plan. You see, he had taken part of his army and they had dug a channel—a channel to re-route a river—to re-route the very river that sustained life inside the walls. Therefore, the river took another path and the water levels dropped and that night Belshazzar gave his life without a fight as the armies of the Persians and the Medes went under the walls, through the riverbed, into a city with people intoxicated through worship to their own pagan gods and judgment was executed.
 
I find this kind of funny in some aspects—the part that I find funny is that even though Daniel said, 'You can take your stuff and stick it,' Belshazzar still put the gold chain around Daniel's neck and still thinks he's in charge and puts Daniel in charge as 3rd highest power in his kingdom which lasted only a couple hours because the kingdom now doesn't exist. The kingdom has just been overthrown. If Belshazzar had had some wisdom, he would have made that move with Daniel long ago and asked him to be a part of the leadership to lead in a direction of wisdom.
 
Siege—under siege—what does it mean to be under siege? There are a lot of things that I put together but it means it's 'a military operation to surround a town, or to surround a building, or surround a certain thing cutting it off from essential supplies in order to create isolation from help.'--in order to create isolation from help and that is to lessen the resistance of defenders. And that is the strategy. The strategy is to surround, to cut off, to isolate and to lessen your courage and your fight if you're the one inside the city. As I've thought about that this week, we started this last week with saying that 2016 was the year of attack and I thought 1st service went really well last week and I thought 2nd service was spectacular. I just saw people's hearts that were breaking, tears that were being shed from fights, from wars and from battles.  Some of those battles, however, are self-inflicted—we need to understand that. We make decisions and we have to live with them. We make bad decisions—we have to live with them. Some of the battles—some of the fights—have nothing to do with us; it is totally out of our control. The ones that are totally out of our control we feel so helpless because we didn't have anything to do with them; the ones that we self-inflict, sometimes we can't hardly get out of it because we feel so much guilt. Satan is crafty! And what he would love to do is put you under siege. He would love to have a military operation and I believe that he is doing that. Last week when I talked about how when Jesus was tempted, when Satan left Jesus, it said that Jesus went away and Satan left him 'waiting for a more opportune time.' Make no mistake about it; Satan is waiting to circle your city; he is looking for a more opportune time to circle your city, to circle your house, to circle you individually so that he can by military operation, he can cut off your essential supplies. What we want to identify over the next few weeks is 'what are your essential supplies?' What are those things you have to have to live? You see, Belshazzar was under the figment of his imagination and thought that all he needed was the Euphrates River—all he needed was water because if he had water, he had sustainable life. But sometimes Satan uses those same delusions to us to make us believe that we are okay when we're really not. Belshazzar, as he sat there that night, he would have never dreamed what was going to happen and Daniel stood right in front of him and told him. 'Your kingdom is stripped from you. You're just a footnote in history.' He got caught looking at those fortified walls—nobody would get over those walls. Guess what? They didn't—they came under them and Belshazzar didn't put up a fight.
 
Satan wants to isolate us; he wants to cut off all of our essential needs and all those things that we need and sometimes it's diverting us to think that there are certain things that we don't need and we don't think we need the things that we really need. But I do believe that one of his biggest tools is the isolation; he wants to isolate us and it's amazing how he can isolate us in the midst of a large group. It's amazing how you can be sitting in a huge room and feel so lonely; there are people everywhere, but you feel so alone. It's amazing that I can have a Book of such hope but he can convince me that all is hopeless. He is crafty!
 
1 Peter 5:8 tells us ""Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour."" He is on the move and he is looking for you; he is looking for an opportune time to lay siege to you. You know I've done a lot of reading the last couple weeks about history's greatest sieges and I haven't read 1% of them. I was astounded; I never had any idea how many historic sieges there have been and I've been reading on them and just looking at everything from recent to way, way back—the oldest being in the Valley of Megiddo, the oldest recorded siege and to see the motivation from it and to see that sometimes those sieges took decades to finally break someone down; I've learned a lot from that. In a spiritual sense there are a lot of us that Satan probably started laying siege to back in the 1980's and he's been working at isolating us for 10, 20, 30 or 40 years—to isolate us—to cut us off from our essential supplies, and to put us in a position where we don't trust the Book of Promises. Let me re-phrase that; that we don't trust the God of the Book of Promises.
 
He attacks in different ways—in different times—in different places; he attacks our family lives. He lays siege to our families; he lays siege to our marriages—he lays siege to our values; he lays siege to us physically; he lays siege to our social structure. He lays siege to our children and that's the one I hate the most—he's laid siege to our children and sometimes uses the sieges he has laid in our lives—in the destruction of our lives and uses that to lay siege to our children. Spiritual war is fought on many different fronts—many different battlefields. If you were to look at military stuff and things that they use for battle would be very different if you were fighting in a desert setting or if you were fighting in a jungle. As simple as colors would be very different and the enemy is really good at camouflage. He's really good at masquerading and presenting himself as something that he's not. He's very strategic in that he knows that the best way to destroy our children is to destroy the parents, and he knows that!
 
It's not that much different in basketball. In basketball it is very simple—it's a simple game. But I've had games before where the other team has a great point guard. Everybody else on the team is kind of mediocre but they have a great guard that can handle the ball and can really get people where they need to be and because he can get them to handle the ball and get them where they need to be, he can get them the ball and they can be effective, even though they're not that great, but he's really good. He's really good and he makes everybody else better! As a coach, you know what I want to do? I want to cut the head off the beast. I'm going to send two guys—I'm going to send two defenders after that guard and make him give the ball to someone else—make someone else do it, because I know that guy can do it and I think sometimes that's Satan's strategy. Why does he go after leaders? Why does he wage war on the souls and the hearts of spiritual leaders?—because he knows that if there is some pastor who is leading some church of 20,000 people and things are going great—if he can hammer that 1 or 2 people, he can destroy multitudes of people at once. It shouldn't be that way but sometimes people place their faith in people instead of God, but even in spite of that, it has ripple effects.
 
I mean think about your spiritual mentor, whoever that is—if they would fall, how would that damage you? It just does—it's no different from destroying the parents. Satan takes no pity—no mercy; he revels in your hurt—he parties when you're pitiful. When you're lying in the bottom of the barrel and rolling around not knowing which way to go to even begin to try to climb out, he loves it.
 
I walked into Luke 4 last week and I want to walk into Luke 5 today. I'm just going to read a simple story and make a comment. Now this is just one chapter over from last week where he was preaching His first sermon and they wanted to throw Him over a cliff.  (JR began reading Luke 5:12-13.) You know what—there is not a thing in the Bible, in the New Testament, I don't think, that could lay someone under siege as effectively as leprosy. You want to talk about cutting off all avenues of hope; you want to talk about creating the biggest world of isolation and loneliness—that is leprosy! The only people you have to associate with are the people sitting next to you in the leper colony that are dying along with you that have no hope. What a hopeless world!  Oh, it's not even Babylon where you have a river coming under the city where you can get water and you can fish and you can get water and you can plant gardens as long as the people on the outside don't get in, you can maybe grow some food and it may take a while but you can eventually have something but they don't even have that hope—they're sitting in a leper colony and they have no hope—they have nothing but misery until Jesus comes along and when Jesus came along, there was at least one man who said, 'Lord, if you are willing, you can change my future. You can change it.' And Jesus said, 'I'm willing.' But you know what?—he had to get up off his heiny and he had to leave all those others that were sitting around him dying and he had to go to Jesus and he had to say, 'I need help.' If he just sits there, nothing changes; if he just sits there, nothing changes.
 
Faith is active! Trusting God is active! Does God always put everything back the way we want it in order to give us hope and for all our problems to go away?—No! That has never been the picture of the Bible. The picture of the Bible is hope and it's hope even beyond what we think of here in this temporary life--it is hope eternal. And that is what Jesus gives and those are the things we're going to be looking at in the coming weeks that Jesus restores hope. How is it that when Satan lays siege to certain aspects of our lives, how do we fight that? What do we do? Let's pray.
 
 
Closing Prayer – Lord, how do we fight that and what do we do? Sometimes our hurt is so deep; he has laid siege to our lives and the hurt, and the despair and the isolation is so deep. Lord, may we do what the leper did—may we get up and move toward you. Lord, may we move toward trusting you and making that statement 'Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean. You can change my future.' Lord, we must just assume that even though the leprosy was gone for this man, that he had other problems—other issues—other hurts that took place in his life, but Lord, we also know he had the promises that we have read in past weeks that he looks forward to a future where there is no more pain, no more crying, no more tears. Lord, may be trust you. We know the enemy is here to steal, to kill, and to destroy and he is relentless and he never gets tired of his assault and he wears us down and he wears us down and he wears us down until he gets us. But Lord, we know that the only way he will get us is if we don't run to you. So Lord that would be my hope; that would be my prayer that we get up, that we leave the leper colony and that we come to you and we pursue hope through you. God, I thank you for a new start; I thank you for new chances. I thank you for refining us through our pain and our trials and our struggles. Lord, I pray that we would never be discouraged enough to take eyes off of you. Lord, I pray for those in here who are hurting and struggling. I pray for people in that situation just like that email Heather read, a year ago they would have never dreamed what they were about to embark on. And Lord, there are others of us in here who are in that same situation; we have no idea what is coming in 2, 3 or 6 months from now but Lord, help us to never lose sight of the fact that you walk with us and that we just need to keep stride with you. Lord, if there is anyone in here today who needs to pursue a relationship of faith and trust with you, Lord, I pray that you would touch our hearts and that you would motivate our spirits that Lord, that we would take a step. Lord, if we need to go into the waters of immersion and die to our own self and be buried and be born again, Lord, I pray that today might be that day—it will be somebody's birthday. Lord Jesus, thank you for the hope we have in you and it's in your Name we pray. Amen.

",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",1/8/2017,
"Good morning! I'm glad we can both be here. (The attendance was down 1st service.) Well, you know that New Year's Day will be the ones that God appoints to be here with people being out, especially with kids and what have you.
 
I always struggle with New Year's Day—not from a personal standpoint, but from a preaching standpoint—especially when it falls on Sunday obviously because it really impacts who is here, but I also struggle with it because of the whole New Year's resolution thing. I probably mention this every year because that's what we do; that's who we are. But you know I don't think it is inherently wrong; I mean it's okay because it's a new start to a new year so our minds are geared to new starts in a new year and so we start to think about those things that we would like to change. One of the lists that I saw this week about New Year's resolutions starting with #10 (it was a top 10 list of basic things that people will resolute to do in this new year.) #10 is to improve a relationship; #9 is to spend less time on social media; (as I was reading I thought if you spend less time on social media that will probably help you improve the relationship) #8 is volunteer more or to give my time to a worthy cause; #7 is to travel; #6 is to eat healthier; (I read this while sitting at McDonald's—hey, it wasn't my resolution—it was just what I was reading); #5 is to be smarter with my money; #4 is to drink less alcohol; #3 is to learn a new skill; #2 is to quit smoking; and #1 is to lose weight and/or exercise more—they were kind of combined. It's kind of funny because that's the one that everybody kind of goes to every year that people think about. I was thinking about New Year's resolutions and the whole idea of how many people will break their New Year's resolution today in that their New Year's resolution was to go to church more and then they realize that today was New Year's Day and it fell on Sunday so thought 'I will start that next week on January 8.' As I was thinking about that, I was laughing because of how easy it is to break them. Right? I mean it's so easy even though we have good intentions, but it's so easy to be distracted. Noah Wallace told me something yesterday, as he doesn't believe in New Year's resolutions and we had been talking about that last night and he said, 'I just think it is ridiculous because I don't think they work.' What he said was really pretty profound; I'm paraphrasing it but basically what he said was 'If you know you need to change, you should just do it; it shouldn't take a special day of the year on the calendar to change because if it takes a day on the calendar, then you're not really convinced that you need to change, so you're really not going to do it.'  It's just a day. Now I'm kind of adding to what he said, but that's basically what he said. I stood there and I thought 'You know there's a lot of truth to that.'
 
And so today as we start a new year, I was trying to think about coming out of Christmas where Jesus obviously started on a new journey in this world through the birth of His mother and I was thinking about how it was that He started into other new starts and into other new beginnings so I went a few chapters over in the book of Luke from the Christmas story to Luke 4 and that's where I want to spend some time this morning.
Now we have jumped 30 years ahead as He is now about 30 years old as it tells us that He was roughly 30 years old when He started His ministry and when we get to Chapter 4 we find that He gets a new start—it's a new resolution, so to speak, but it's not a resolution like the way we make them. Typically we make new resolutions because what we've been doing isn't good; Jesus wasn't starting out with a new resolution resolving to do something because of anything that He was doing wrong or bad; it was just a new phase of life for Him. He had lived life as a carpenter's son in the town of Nazareth and now He is ready to embark on ministry. He goes to the Jordan River in the wilderness to be baptized by John the Baptist and after that He is led by the Spirit of God to be led into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan. All of this is within the scope of His purpose—this new purpose—this new start—this new mission, and His new mission—His new start was to give people a new start. It was to give people a new start, because things were really starting to shift for Him. I am going to start in Luke 4 with Verse 14. He has been gone away from His hometown. (JR began reading the passage pausing after Verse 15.) So as He walked through the Galilee on His way back, He had gone from Northern Israel to Southern Israel to the wilderness, to the Jordan River, gone through baptism, gone through temptation, and now He is on His way back as He comes up the Jordan River, travels around the west side of the Sea of Galilee and then up into the hills and the people are mesmerized at His teaching. (JR resumed reading with Verse 16 pausing after Verse 17.) Let me stop right there for just a second and go back to our yearly Torah cycle.  When we read the Torah for a year, we also had a Haftarah portion which was the prophets, so we see a picture here of Jesus going into the synagogues in the weekly portion being given to Him. (JR resumed repeating Verse 17 and continuing thru Verse 19.) When He read that, it almost kind of sounds like a New Year's resolution as it was ""to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor."" (JR resumed with Verse 20 ending with Verse 30.)  
 
The story of New Year's resolution, ""to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor""—the story of new beginnings—the story of a new start—the story of Jesus' ministry. The story of Jesus' ministry ends with His congregation on the first day wanting to throw Him off a cliff—an effective sermon.  I mean Day 1, out of the gates, they are ready to chuck Him over the hill.
 
As I was looking and praying over the story, I was thinking 'what is it that Jesus came to do?' What is it that Jesus came to do? We could go through the Scriptures and we could find the places where He said, 'I've come to seek and to save the lost,' and all the multiple things that He said, but in this particular passage here, He says these things in Verses 18 and 19. (JR repeated reading Luke 4:18-19, pausing after Verse 18a.) Jesus was sent and part of this New Year's resolution—this new mission—this new ministry start was to proclaim the good news to the poor. (JR continued with first of Verse 18b.) Now freedom for prisoners—the first thing that most people would think when we hear that phrase freedom for prisoners is people in prison, but as we study the life of Jesus, we see the scope of that is so much bigger. It's not about getting a Presidential pardon and being set free from behind bars but it's about being set free from the prison of ourselves and that sin nature and all the stuff and all the garbage that has so filled and contaminated our lives. Just think for a minute about your prisons. Think about loneliness; think about hurt; think about all those prisons and all those things that have impacted and affected the way we walk through life—all those prisons that impact the way we relate to people—the way we respond to people. Thing about a dog which has been mistreated; so often you can tell because when you go up to pet it, what does it do? It will cower down or it will rare back and you can tell a lot of times how a dog has been treated in life with what a dog has gone through by the way it responds to you. So often the people we run into in life, we get the overflow of that hurt, depending upon the timing of the conversations with them. It says Jesus came ""to set the prisoners free.""  People all over the world today will make resolutions—you know why?—because they are in prison!  It's those prisons that they are seeking refuge from. Think about all of those things I just read. Every single one of those things—the reason why people make them is because there is a prison there. There is something they are fighting—there is something they are wrestling. And it says that (JR continued reading ""He came to give recovery of sight to the blind."") We see that in His life with His ministry that He walked through that He physically did that. And these 2 verses restates the same thing: (""He comes to set the oppressed free."") Those who are so overwhelmed, He wants to show them there is light at the end of the tunnel and it's not that of a train. And in Verse 19 it says that (""He comes to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor."") He came to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor—He was telling them ""I am the Messiah."" They didn't understand it; they didn't understand it the way we understand it now; so much of life is easier to understand when you get on this side of it. You know when I was in my 20's there were things I didn't understand that I understand more clearly now because I'm on the other side of it. We get on this side of it and look back on the life of Jesus and we say 'Oh, it's obvious that He came because He was born and He was here to die upon a cross to fulfill the ultimate obligation of sin and then He went to the Father in Heaven and He will then come back and He will get us and He will restore all things.' But when you're living in that moment, it's not quite as clear and the Old Testament prophets aren't quite as clear and it seems a little more obscure. Jesus says He came ""to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor,"" and in order to gain the LORD's favor, there had to be sacrifice. There had to be someone and something to pay the price for the penalty of sin.
 
Now that was an excerpt that Jesus read out of Isaiah 61. If you want to know what Jesus will do when He comes back a second time, go and finish reading the rest of Isaiah 61 because that first part of Isaiah 61 He stops mid-sentence—literally in His reading—and He says ""Today, these things have been fulfilled within you.""  The rest of Isaiah 61 is a good study to have later where you can look to see what happens the next time Jesus comes.
 
So Jesus came for those things and as I looked down through this passage, I see that Jesus was well thought of, at least initially. It says (JR paraphrased Verse 22) 'All the people spoke well of Him and were amazed at His gracious words that came from His lips.' They were amazed; they were astonished; word had traveled. We see it in the other Gospels that He spoke and He taught with authority that other teachers didn't have. And we see that He spoke with a grace and a mercy and a love and a compassion that other teachers didn't have, so there was an authority of truth combined with grace and mercy and love and people were drawn to that but it didn't last. It seemed like it was well received and externally it was, but it wasn't so much internally. The second half of Verse 23 Jesus says to them, (JR read it.) Jesus knew that in their hearts, though they expressed things verbally, He knew that they didn't really deep down feel that way. He knew that deep down there was this thought lingering that of 'Okay, Jesus, we've heard that you've done things at these other places so now what are you going to do for me? You know, after all, you were my next door neighbor but you weren't next door neighbors to those other people that you helped in those other places, so what is it that you're going to do for me?' As I was studying and looking though that this week, I was thinking about how guilty sometimes we are as Christians. I don't even think it is consciously, but we get in that mode where we praise Jesus because of what He is going to do for us. We accept Him and we verbally acknowledge His existence because of what He's going to do for us or for what He has done for us. Now, that in its entirety isn't bad but if that is it exclusively, then it probably is. Because as I was thinking through it, we need to be praising Jesus for who He is, not for what He will give. I should be praising Jesus in spite of my circumstances, even if I don't feel that He has answered my prayers, because of who He is. We should honor Him and we should acknowledge Him, not based upon our current circumstances.  Our son or daughter asks us 'Can I go here or there,' and we answer 'No;' they ask 'Why?'—and we say?—because I said so. And they want further explanation and they're mad and they are irritated, and the reality is that if you honor your parents in a perfect world, you will accept their authority and you will accept their knowledge and you will accept their wisdom, and you will accept their reasoning; you will love and honor and respect them and cherish that because of who they are—not just because they said, ""yes."" Right? But so often, we give honor, praise and thanks, based upon ""condition."" You see, God loves us unconditionally—I mean His love is expressed to us unconditionally; Scriptures tell us in the book of Romans that God did not wait for us to become perfect, but in spite of our sin, He sent Jesus to die. He loves us unconditionally and didn't say, 'Okay, when you become good enough' or 'okay, when you check off all the list, then I will love you.' Jesus saw through it; He saw through the real feelings—light exposes darkness—He saw that on the exterior they were praising Him and acknowledging His teaching and that verbally, but on the inside it was about what they were going to get.
 
The third thing I saw in this passage is that when Jesus shows up; you know, we always ask Jesus to come and give us peace but when Jesus shows up, it's just not always peaceful. As a matter of fact, He said at His First Coming, during that time and during that ministry that He would divide and that this world, even in our own families, there will have to be lines drawn and people will have to choose their allegiance. We are going to have to choose whether we will align ourselves with Jesus or whether we align ourselves with the world. Even those who seem to know Jesus best may not always be on board with where Jesus is going. Hear that—even those who seem to know Jesus the best may not always be on board with where Jesus is going. When Jesus returned to Nazareth, these are the people He had grown up with and had spent 30 years in this little village—this small village that was essentially a family that located there and expanded. They knew everybody and everybody knew Him. These were the people who knew Him the best, yet they were not on board with Him. As a matter of fact, you go even closer than that where during His ministry, there were times that His brothers would come to them and they would kind of roll their eyes and say, ""Eh, He's crazy.' Even those who knew Him best were not always on board with where He was going, so I can't see that it would be any different in today's world that sometimes the people who seem to know Him best may not always be on board with where He is going. Why?—because we're people and people have agendas; people have agendas. We all do; some of those agendas are good and some of those agendas aren't good and when I say ""good"" and ""aren't good,"" some of those agendas align with God and some of my agendas probably don't align with God. And it is absolutely critical that we pray for discernment to be able to discern where God is going—where God is going in my own life, in my own family, in my own community, in my own church family; we need those eyes to be able to discern because sometimes the people who seem to be closest to Jesus may not be on board with where Jesus is actually headed. Their agendas from within would throw Jesus off a cliff in order to fulfill their own agendas.
 
This passage of Jesus' first recorded sermon in His hometown of Nazareth—as I looked at this, it took me back to the first portion of Luke 4. It took me back to the temptation in the wilderness; it took me back to Satan asking or stating to Him, 'If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread,' and Jesus responded saying, ""It is written that people do not live by bread alone. . . ."" It took me back to Satan telling Him from the mountain top to 'Look out into all the world and if you would bow down and worship me, I will give all this to you,' to which Jesus responded, 'Worship the LORD your God and serve Him only.' And then it took me back to Jesus being taken up onto the threshold of the Temple by Satan and him saying, 'If you are truly the Son of God, cast yourself off and He will command His Angels to catch you and protect you,' to which Jesus responded, 'Do not put the LORD your God to the testH
It ItAs .' But the verse that really struck me out of this whole thing was Verse 13 which says, ""When the devil had ended all this tempting, he left Jesus until a more opportune time."" He left Jesus until a more opportune time. I've actually preached on that before but again, it jumped off the pages at me that there is an opportune time in your life where Satan will attack and he is just waiting; he's waiting—he's waiting for your vulnerability. He's waiting for your weak moment; he's waiting for you to turn your head so he can come from the other side. He's waiting for an opportune time. That statement is followed by Him going home. Preaching to those who are closest to Him and them taking Him out to the edge of a cliff to toss Him off. Was that the opportune time that Satan thought that he might be able to slide in there? Because sometimes that's what he does; he'll take circumstances and those circumstances include people—it's people that he will often use as that opportune time. Paul tells us what?—that ""Bad company corrupts good character."" He doesn't say 'Bad company sometimes corrupts good character.' He says ""Bad company corrupts good character."" If you spend enough time around bad company, it will corrupt your character. That's what God says! Sometimes it's people; sometimes it's places; sometimes it's a combination of people and places. There are certain things that Jesus says and when this temptation comes, He says to what?—flee from location—flee the location—flee the people you are around—flee—get out of there. Sometimes our vulnerability is within the people we trust; sometimes the more opportune time will come within the people we trust, within the people that know us the best because they're not on board with where Jesus is headed.
2016 as I look back—as I HH
look back at 2016, both for me personally and as a leader of this church, I see 2016 as a year of attacks—it was a year of attacks. Our family at ACC has been decimated by hurt! And when I say that, I'm talking individually. There have been more people this past year go through terrible circumstances and I'm talking about numbers. It doesn't mean over the past years that people haven't gone through awful and traumatic things because that is just part of life and it happens and it stinks, but 2016, at least from what I've seen has been the ""year of the attack""—the year, for whatever reason, I believe Satan has said he has looked for a more opportune time and within the lives of lots of our people, he has said, 'This is the time.' And he has brought out the sledgehammer and he has pounded away and he's pounded and he's pounded and he's pounded and it seems like sometimes there is no hope and it seems like he is totally relentless, and he is, but as I also look back at this year because of many of the stories that I know and that I'm aware of, this lightbulb kind of went off in my mind, and it's something that I've actually mentioned quite frequently, but I wrote it down when I thought about it, driving down the road and yes, I was one of those writing as I was driving down the road, but what I wrote is ""attack is often caused by proximity to Jesus.' Attack is often caused by proximity to Jesus—the closer to Him—the more apt we are to getting hit. 
 
So as I look back on 2016 as 'the year of the attack,' it's not necessarily a negative thing because so often when we are attacked, it's because we're so close in proximity to where we need to be. Jesus said, 'They are going to hate you because of me,' that we are going to suffer because of Him. It's just a part of it; it's just part of life—it stinks, but sometimes the attacks that we suffer are a true measure of where we are in proximity to Jesus. Many of the people who have gone through attacks this last year are people who have grown in their faith more in the last year or year and a half than they have ever grown in their lives. And so Satan says what?—'this is an opportune time. They are a threat, so I need to attack.' But in the midst of attack, some of us are weary. In the midst of attack, some of us feel like 'Is it worth it?' In the midst of attack, some of us feel like throwing in the towel; in the midst of attack, some of us often mumble the question 'Is God real? Is He there? Does He really care?'
 
I read this statement by Jim Cymbala who is the preacher/pastor of the Brooklyn Tabernacle in Brooklyn, New York. He said this: ""God is attracted to weakness; He can't resist those who humbly and honestly admit how desperately they need Him."" I read that statement earlier this week and I was thinking about it and I was kind of reflecting on Bible stories of Jesus and man that is so true. Jesus was attracted to weakness. Jesus was attracted to those who were needy; Jesus was attracted to those who said, 'Lord, I believe, but help me in my unbelief; Lord, I am at the end; you are the only One; you are the only hope—the only One,' and we see that Jesus responded. We see that Jesus responded to that and so what I say this year as a church that this year in 2017 we might be what Paul says, 'Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come.' The old has gone and the new is here. If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. What I say is 'This year let's move through the year of attacks and let this be the year of a new creation and let's live in proximity to Jesus and let's claim desperately our need for Him.' And if you're not going through it right now, claim it for your friends. Claim it for those you don't even know. Walk in proximity to Jesus—claim His grace, and His mercy upon your life. Pray He will use you as an outlet to speak into people and to encourage people in their time of hurt and in their time of despair. And may 2017 be the Year of the Overcomer. May it be the year when we look back at Satan and say ""Pfft, forget you; our God is bigger than you. No matter what you want to throw, our God is bigger than you."" ""We will not bow down to that idol; even if you throw us in the fiery furnace, we will not bow because our God is bigger than you."" Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Abba, thank you for a tough year, really because we know the testing of our faith develops perseverance and perseverance brings maturity. We don't like it but we need it, so God I thank you. I don't want to be guilty of giving you thanks and praise and glory only in our prosperity; according to what we just read, we don't praise you because we expect you to give us good things, but Lord, we praise you because you are good. God, I pray that as we kick off this New Year that you would speak encouragement into us, Lord that we might be the light that shines and exposes the darkness just the way Jesus did in Nazareth. Light exposes darkness. The Scriptures tell us to do good deeds and to let our light shine before men. Lord, I pray that this might be a year where we focus on that even harder and if Satan wants to fight, so be it! Lord, may we be locked in to you and may we be totally dependent on you. In the Name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",1/1/2017,
"They asked for a warrior; He gave them a baby. What we talked about last week is we were looking through the Christmas promises from Gabriel to Mary. They asked for a warrior because of the conditions—because of the situation in Israel at the time, so they wanted someone that would come in and be a Great Deliverer; He gave them a baby—a baby lying in a manger, but it wasn't one who was going to come and provide for the needs of people the way they saw it at that time; He sent them a baby who was totally dependent upon a mother to feed Him and to take care of Him. He gave them what they needed and when they needed it. In our minds, we don't always get that. Last week we were talking about that a little bit, about this whole idea of their wanting a Deliverer but He gave them a sacrifice. They wanted someone who was going to come overthrow Rome, but He gave them someone who would submit Himself to a cross.
 
Today I want to re-read the portion of Scripture that we've been looking at when Gabriel came to Mary in Luke 1:26-38. (JR read it.) He will be called the Son of God. Last week the focus was, to a degree, they wanted a Deliverer—they wanted a King—they wanted a Warrior, but He sent them a baby, but He didn't just send them a baby; He sent them a child who would grow into a man.  It wasn't just a snapshot because in a snapshot sometimes we have of Christmas is just a babe in a manger, but really the snapshot of Christmas is a bigger picture when you look at the promises that Gabriel gave to Mary because they cover such a large scope. It's not just an event that happened when the angels appeared to the shepherds and we have this cute, sweet Christmas story. It goes much bigger than that. The first step of the journey is from this childhood, from being a baby to becoming a man. As parents we want our sons to obey; that's what we would love. I mean how much easier it would be when you start off life having children knowing that they're going to do everything you ask. Now I think some parents actually start out that way and then when the child is about 2, they realize that obedience doesn't always transpire. I mean I've literally met people that thought 'Well, it'll be different for me, because I have a real gift with kids.' Yeah, I get it. 'You have a real gift with kids, but the carnal sinful nature has a real gift at deterring kids, too.' You know, it's back to what I've said multiple, multiple times; we don't have to teach our kids to lie as it just comes naturally. We have to teach them to what?—to tell the truth. We have to teach them to tell the truth because lying comes naturally as that's what's woven in to the fiber of who we are. Life experiences have taught us as adults and there are a lot of things that we want to speak into our kids—into our sons—to prevent them from making the same mistakes that we have, because they haven't been where we are. They haven't learned some of these things because they know better. I mean, they know better than us. When I was 17 I knew better than my dad. I mean, I knew—especially teen-age boys tend to be wired; they think they know the better way and then when we get to my age, you look back and realize—'Eh, maybe I didn't know so much. Maybe there were a few things I could have learned.' They don't have the same experiences that we have.
A couple weeks ago I went to eat lunch after church with my friend Cade Henderson; I think Cade is in 3rd grade. We ate up at the Pizza Shack to talk about baptism and while we were sitting there Cade—I figured out really quickly that Cade measures everything in time by football; it's just what he does. He watches all these YouTube football-type things and at one point we were talking about how old I was and he responded with ""Wooowww!"" That wasn't really the response I was looking for, but he was like ""Wooowww! That means you were a kid when Dan Marino was throwing touchdowns for the Miami Dolphins.""  I wasn't really sure how to respond to that but I said, 'Yeah, well, Cade, actually I was.' All the way through the rest of our conversation, that's what he'd say, ""Wooowww! It's unbelievable."" A few minutes later—he couldn't get over this age thing—so we were sitting there and his sister, Chloe, was sitting with my daughter on the other side of the table; Shanna and Chloe are both freshmen in high school, so Chloe, Cade's older sister, is over there half the time remarking, ""Oh, Cade,"" doing the older sister thing. Finally Cade said, ""You know what? I just realized you are sooo old you were alive when Bernie Sanders was running for the Detroit Lions."" And I questioned, ""Bernie Sanders? I think you mean Barry Sanders."" At that point, Chloe was like ""Cade, just stop, please."" As he would go on and on, it was just a reminder to me that I've had life experiences that Cade hasn't had; he seemed to be astonished with my age and I guess my wisdom, too.
 
We want to be able to feed our children knowledge and wisdom and we hope that they will grab it and that they will run—that they will go—that they will walk right, but how many of us have had those sad moments when we realize that the war that the world sets out to oppose our kids is winning. It's hard when we're looking reality in the face and we know that there's a path that God has laid out that's the better way but then they choose differently. You see I believe that in the life of Jesus that He was fully human. I've shared before that the Gospels kind of paint this picture of Jesus in the following ways: the Gospel of Matthew was the Gospel that was written—it was a Jewish Gospel but it was written to prove the Kingship of Jesus. Everything in the Gospel of Matthew points to the fact that Jesus was to be the King of Israel; the book of Mark is the servant's Gospel saying He was a servant—Jesus did this and Jesus did that; the book of Luke starts with showing that Jesus was fully human. Luke, being a doctor, talks about things that the other Gospels sometimes leave out—some of those little snippets, and the genealogy in Luke traces Jesus all the way back to Adam to show that He was fully human, but in the Gospel of John the genealogy is that Jesus was the Word of God—the Word was with God and the Word was God; it shows the Divinity of Jesus. I believe that Jesus was fully human and because of that I believe that He was challenged with temptations, just the way the book of Hebrews says. I believe that even when Joseph and Mary tried to set Him in a direction that was positive, I believe that the temptations that He faced were real and that He could have chosen to oppose His Father—that He came to a crossroads many times although ultimately the big one that we see in Matthew 4 was that big collision when Satan himself comes to tempt Jesus. You see if Jesus wasn't fully human, and if He didn't have the capacity to walk away from the Father, then the temptation passages are meaningless. If Jesus didn't have the capacity to choose differently, then He wasn't really tempted because the temptation comes in when there is a reality that you've come to a fork in the road and you know the right way and you can choose a different way. But Jesus was on a mission. He left childhood and He became a man. He became a man and He was subject to temptation just like we are, but yet He was without sin just as the Scripture says. Jesus, we find as a Son that He would be called the Son of God—He took that calling so seriously that it motivated every move He made. The fact that He was the Son of God was the driving force in all the decisions that He made. He said things like this: He said, ""I have not come to do my own will, but the will of Him who sent me."" He said, ""I do nothing on my own, but only what the Father asks me to do."" Throughout His whole life—throughout His whole ministry, He continued to focus back on what was His calling as the Son of God—what God had called Him to do, and who God had called Him to be. We see that come to a climax in the Garden of Gethsemane. In the Garden of Gethsemane when human nature said 'I don't want to go through what I'm about to go through,' as He prayed before He was handed over to the Romans and to the Jewish leaders to be persecuted—to be beaten—to be nailed to a cross, He went to His Father and He said, 'Abba, I don't want to do this, but it's not about me; it's about you—not my will but your will.' How many sons would avoid traumatic collisions in life? If we could only humble ourselves to the truth—if we could submit ourselves to the Father. It doesn't mean bad things might not happen; I don't see the cross as a good thing in the life of a human being—oh, ultimately it was good for all of us but it wasn't something that most people are going to sign up for. We don't look at that and think, 'Hey, where are you going to go on vacation this year? Oh, I think I will go to Calvary and let them nail me to a cross.' It's not an event that any of us would cherish. Now, again, obviously it was good for all of us because we needed a sacrifice; they wanted a Redeemer—someone to set them free from the bondage of Rome but within that package God said, 'You need a sacrifice because you need a Redeemer a lot bigger than that. Your problems aren't just confined to Rome.'
                                                    
In Philippians 2:5-8, a familiar passage, the Apostle Paul said to the believers at Philippi (JR read it.) The Son of God was willing to submit—the Son of God being the very nature of God—Emmanuel—God with us—God among us—being God wrapped in human flesh—in the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God and the Word was God. He took on human flesh and He dwelt among us. Even in the midst of all of that, Jesus did not use His superior Deity when He was here; He was here as a Son. He was here to show the world what it means to submit to the Father, and because He was willing to do that, Paul writes here how He fulfills this very thing to a large degree of what Gabriel had said to Mary. If you go back and read the promises to Mary we will kind of conclude this next week or I guess next Saturday. (JR then read Philippians 2:9-10.) That's what a son does. A son brings glory to his father through submission and obedience. How many times maybe was I an embarrassment to my father because I wasn't submissive in my heart? How important is it for us? And if we don't have earthly fathers, and honestly, some of us don't have earthly fathers that are really cultivating a right direction for us, especially spiritually, how much even more so important is it that we look at God and say, 'Where is it that you would have us walk?'—and the submission we should have.
 
The term 'Son of Man' is the most frequent term that Jesus used about Himself. When He referred to Himself—think about this—this is Emmanuel, God among us—this is Jesus who once sat by the Father in Heaven who has now taken on human flesh and come to earth—you think of all the adjectives that He could have used to describe Himself; King of Glory, Creator of all things,--I mean He could have used all these different things describing who it is that He was but He chose most often 'Son of Man.' Son of Man—a term of humility, used 88 times in the New Testament—this title of humanity, but also this title of humanity and humility points to His glorious future. It is derived and originated, I believe, in Daniel 7:13-14. The Prophet Daniel is speaking to Belshazzar, the grandson of Nebuchadnezzar—Belshazzar had had this dream and it was a dream kind of like his grandfather's dream; it was a dream speaking of kingdoms that were to come and at the end of that Daniel says this: (JR read it.) This picture in the book of Daniel was the same vision that God gave to Mary through Gabriel that she would have a son and He would be human flesh but because He lived the true meaning of what it was to be a son and to honor His Father and God was going to bring Him great glory.
 
One of the most famous passages read especially from the Old Testament this time of year is from the Prophet Isaiah in Isaiah 9:6-7. I wish I really could spend time in Verses 1-5 and in those Verses 8 and following but I don't have time. (He read Verses 6-7 pausing after the beginning of Verse 6.)  So Mary was the one who was going to give birth but the child wasn't a gift exclusively to her and her family; this gift was to be worldwide. (JR finished reading the passage.) The same thing that Gabriel told to Mary was something he had told years earlier to Daniel, something that God had told years earlier to Isaiah and the Old Testament prophets had spoken about this and I cannot even imagine what Mary was thinking when Gabriel started to speak these words to her that 'You are going to have a child and He is going to be called the Son of the Most High God that one day He will reign on David's throne and one day He will take over David's kingdom and one day He will give peace to all the world'—that one she had read about and heard from her forefathers and the prophets and now God has spoken to her and said, 'That child will be in your womb.'
 
In Psalm 2 it starts with the rebellion of man. (JR read Verses 1-3.) And following the rebellion of man comes the rebuke of God. (JR continued reading Verses 4-6.) Followed by the rebuke of God is the revealing of the Messiah. (JR read Verses 7-9.) Then comes the reconciliation of man. (JR finished the passage by reading Verses 10-12.)  
 
""Kiss the Son or He will be angry and you and your ways will be destroyed."" What does it mean by ""kiss the Son?"" Judas did that! Judas kissed the Son!  Is it just a physical smooch that we're talking about or is it something beyond that? The wording and the intent here is this whole idea of kissing the Son is accepting Him for who He is. It's the embracing of Him and who He is—the essence of and the very core of who He is. You see this is where every man comes to; we come to a point where we are at the crossroads. Jesus came to a point where He was at the crossroads and He had to choose between right and wrong and He chose to submit Himself to the will of His Father. We, too, as people come to this crossroads and our crossroads is ultimately 'What do we do with Jesus?' You see my fear is there are too many people who keep Jesus in a manger. There are too many people who this holiday season will view Jesus as this baby who gave us a great holiday—remember the kid I was talking to last week who said, 'I don't know where we're going but we're going to a lot of places and I'll get a lot of stuff and that's good.' The problem is too much of our culture have left Him as a babe in swaddling clothes and we've been slow to see the big picture—the big picture we see because we get hung up in time. We get hung up in time because the promises of God through Gabriel to Mary give us this picture of not only a babe—not only a child—not only a Son who submitted Himself to the point of death on the cross but also of the Great Warrior who is to come—a Great Warrior who is to come and though He didn't come bringing judgment at His First Coming—He was very gracious; He will bring grace at His 2nd Coming, too, but at His 2nd Coming, He will bring judgment. Jesus will come back to judge the nations and the question is: 'Have you kissed the Son?—have you embraced the Son?—have you accepted Him for who He is?'
 
The very last statement there in Psalm 2 'where His wrath can flare up in a moment, blessed (or fully satisfied) are all who take refuge in Him.' 'Fully satisfied are all who take refuge in Him.' This whole picture that we have as Jesus is the Son of Man—that the Glorious King takes root out of 2 Samuel 7 where God made a promise to King David. He made a promise to King David that the kings would come and they would continue to come from his family and that this was God's plan. I said that Matthew was the Gospel that shows the Kingship of Jesus. I also made mention that genealogy in John is to show the Divinity of Jesus; the genealogy of Luke is to show the humanity of Jesus; the genealogy of the book of Matthew traces Jesus' lineage through David to show that Jesus is the rightful King.
 
So I ask you this Christmas—this holiday season—what do you do with Jesus? Are you ready and have you fully kissed the Son? Have you embraced Him and accepted Him for all that He is as a babe, as the Son of God, and as a Glorious King? Jesus said this: ""The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve and give His life as a ransom for many."" THE GREATEST CHRISTMAS GIFT THAT ANYONE HAS EVER GIVEN IS JESUS GIVING HIS LIFE FOR ME. THERE IS NOTHING THAT ANYONE CAN EVER GIVE THAT COULD SURPASS THAT GIFT. That through my relationship—that through trust in Him, I have restored my relationship with my Heavenly Father.  ""Kiss the Son.""  Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Abba, thank you that we can come in and that we can sing Christmas carols. God, I enjoy the purity of just coming in and singing and just hearing voices and Lord, the way we started our service today just to hear voices call out to you and proclaim who it is that you are was such a cool thing. God, I pray that as we look at the promises that you gave to Mary that we wouldn't forget how human Jesus was. He was given as a baby but He was given as a baby so that He could become a man so that He could give His life. What a great example, God; what a great example of submission and obedience and Lord, may we learn from that. Lord, I pray today that if there is anyone here who has not ""kissed"" Jesus, who has not embraced Him and accepted Him for who He truly is, Lord, I pray that today might be a day of salvation. Today it was a little bit iffy as to whether or not people would be able to get here with the cold and icy weather but God, you have given each of us the chance to be here today and I pray, Lord that your voice does not fall on rocky soil. God it really has zero to do with me. Lord, I pray that if there is anything that I've spoken that has been consistent with your truth, Lord, that it finds fertile soil on our hearts, Lord, that you change us. God, I thank you for the opportunity to be here and I thank you for the opportunity we have been given to and the chance you've given us to submit and Lord, for those of us in here who are fathers what our sons need to see from us is submission; that's what they need to see. They need to see us bend a knee so wherever it is that we are, I pray that you take us on that next step. In the Name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",12/18/2016,
"Is there anyone here this morning that wishes life could be a little more simple? I don't even really need to ask for hands to be raised on that because I already pretty much know the answer to that question because I live in the world and because I do I hear people talking and I know how complex life can be—how complex life is—how we have made it that way. It seems funny to me that so many of us desire a simpler life, but by the things we do and by the things we get involved in we continue to make life more complex—that we add layers that need to be tended to. I have found as I have walked through life, looked around and tried to notice some things, I've noticed that it seems as many people get older, often times they try to simplify life. It may be downsizing a home, or just making life adjustments trying to make life more simple and I think a lot of that has to do with the wisdom of years lived and as we live longer we realize that some of the things maybe that we have thought of being so important aren't quite as important as we thought they were and so our focus and our objectives kind of shift. I think complexity is a difficult thing and it is a difficult thing when it comes to relationships. When we talk about relationships, how many times do we hear or read when somebody says on social media something that says ""dating status,"" and they respond with ""it's complicated."" Why is it complicated? Because we have so many layers and the people we are around have so many layers and complexity can be challenging to relationships and I find it interesting of one of the statements that I've always been drawn to in Scripture is ""Be still and know that I am God."" Don't add multiple layers of complexity and know that I am God, but ""be still . . . .""  I think that obviously God is way more complex a Being that we could ever understand, but God is also, through His complexity, made Himself so simple to us, and it's an amazing thing.
 
I like simple; I've always liked simple. I was trying to think this week why it is that I've always liked simple so much and I came to the conclusion that it's because I'm not too smart, I think, and because I'm really not that smart, it's too hard for me to figure out all the complex stuff and so I've just always kind of liked simple. I'm not that smart but I am smart enough to know that simplicity is easier—that simple is easier. I'll use the example of basketball again; I talk with my basketball players that you can listen to a guy like Coach Knight for an hour and maybe not understand anything he said if he wants to make it very complex. Basketball or sports in general can be a very sophisticated thing because of the complexity of defenses that people will throw at you and the way that they do them and the way that you have to try to maneuver yourself around offensively to do things, but I tell my kids all the time that we've made basketball too difficult—that we've made it too complex because it's really not a hard game—it's really pretty simple. This is basketball in its shell—defend and rebound. Defend your man and rebound. Take care of the ball and get good shots—that's it! I mean basketball can be so complex but it boils down to that; everything that happens within basketball boils down to that—defend and rebound when they shoot. Take care of the ball; don't let them take care of the ball and get good shots. Life sometimes we've made so complex but it doesn't necessarily need to be—we've lost the simplicity at its core.
 
My Uncle Rex was absolutely a brilliant man—actually, he was my great uncle. His first degree was from Butler University and then earned another from George Washington University and then a third from Harvard. He was born in 1910 and passed away a few years ago. Upon graduation he got into the world and was in WWII and he did some different things upon his return from WWII. He became a chief engineer at RCA and in his time at RCA, he invented some of the things that you have enjoyed in your life. He was one of the ones that invented some of the first tubes in the color television; he had the patents on those. He did things and made parts for the first satellites that went up into space—I mean, this guy was sheer genius—I mean talking off the charts smart. I remember when we were kids we would be with them at Christmas and other times and he was almost hard to have a conversation with because you wouldn't really understand what he was talking about, but for him, it was all about his humor. I think he enjoyed talking about things in a way that we were all like ""huh?"" You know like the early bobble heads; we were just kind of nodding our heads like we understood but we really didn't. But I remember the summer after he retired, he left RCA and went back and lived in Mitchell, IN and built a house on our family property about a half mile up the hill from my grandmother and the construction he wanted to build the house himself cause that's kind of who he was so he starts the process of building the house himself, which he has never done before, and he's going to build this house with all high school teenage labor basically. I was down staying with my grandma for a couple of weeks during the summer and it was during the time that he was in this house-building process and at the time I was only in middle school, so you can imagine me with hammer and nails—I'm not sure I would even trust myself with some of that stuff even now, but he gets me in with this crew of high school guys and I remember one day we're up there and my aunt and my Uncle Rex were living in this trailer right next to the house they were building and in this trailer, because he's an engineer, half of the trailer is his work area where he can lay out all of his stuff and makes his plans so each morning we would go up there and Uncle Rex would come out and he would have his hard hat on, which always just cracked me up, because I'm thinking, 'I really hope we don't need hard hats for protection,'—you think my 50-year old mind would go weird places; my 13-year old mind was in a lot weirder places. But I would think of all these reasons why my Uncle Rex might need the hard hat during this day, but I remember one day we were out there and he gathers us around and the framing of the house had gone up and we were getting ready to have the rafters—the trusses—delivered, and so he's telling us what his plan is for these when they deliver these trusses, how we were going to install these up on the house and as he's talking to this group of probably 5 teenage boys and then me tagging along, he begins to kind of explain to them and I remember my Cousin David, who was about 5 years older than me—him at one point saying, 'Hey, Uncle Rex, this seems like this is not that difficult of a process because it seems like if they unload the trusses right here at the end of the house, we should be able to lay 3 ladders up against the end of the house—extension ladders—and just lay them up and then just slide the trusses up the ladders and slide them down the roof and then stand them into place.' My Uncle Rex just kind of looked at him and nodded his head and then continued to speak engineering to us for a while and he went inside and one of the other guys there translated and said 'This is what we're going to do.' So we spent the rest of the day doing all these things. Pretty soon the truss delivery comes and they unload all them there and my Uncle Rex comes out and it's the end of the day; we're not going to be able to do any of these today but my Uncle Rex comes out and he calls us over to these tables and he has all these papers rolled up—you know, these plans, and he unrolls them out on the table and he starts explaining them to us and says, 'Now tomorrow morning we're going to start on these trusses and this is what we're going to do.' He takes about 30 minutes and he shows us these diagrams and everything that he has drawn up as to how we're going to do this and when he was done, I was kind of standing there thinking, 'We're going to take 3 ladders and we're going to put them up on the end of the house where we will slide the trusses up and then we're going to slide them down and then stand them up,' and I remember standing there thinking 'Yeah, I think I've heard this before,' and we go home and we'll see him in the morning, and I remember my Cousin David walking up and kind of chuckled and looked at me and said, 'I think I said that a little while ago.' But my Uncle couldn't wrap his mind around the simplicity of that idea. He had to think the entire thing through. I have never forgotten that; I just thought that was like the funniest thing in my mind at that age that you would have to spend all day going through all this complex stuff in order to do something so simple. Now, I'm certainly not cracking on him, because he was smarter in his little fingernail than I will ever be but I also know that at the end of that day I was thinking, 'I hope I don't ever get there when I get smart.' I hoped that I could always keep simple things simple and keep them simple.
 
The complexity of life—sometimes we do—we get all wound up in the stuff that really doesn't need to be so difficult. The complexity of Christmas—the complexity of Christmas—sometimes for us in our families, it can be like herding cats. You got so much stuff going on. I asked a little kid this past week over at the high school. He was there kind of hanging around; his older siblings were doing things and he was just hanging around so I had a conversation with this young guy asking him, 'So what are you doing for Christmas?' 'Well, we're going to this place and we're going to this other place, and then we're going to another place and that place,' and finally he looked at me and said, 'You know, I really don't know where we're going. I just go wherever they tell me, but I like it because I get a lot of stuff.' It was so funny because in his mind the complexity of Christmas, and to my knowledge, this family are not believers so I was more curious to some degree as to what he thought and what Christmas was like for him. For him it just boiled down to going to a lot of people's houses and getting a lot of stuff.
 
The complexity of Christmas; a child's Christmas list can be pretty complex. Sometimes you have to sort your way through it. Anybody remember going through the magazines and circling everything you wanted? We don't have magazines anymore but back in the day when they actually had catalogs and magazines—Shanna, I'll explain to you later what that was. We'd go through every page and circle stuff that we wanted on it. Someone would have to go through it and flip every page so they wouldn't miss anything that if we were to ask about it, they would have least had knowledge of what we'd talked about. The complexity of Christmas; sometimes the complexity of Christmas to our children can be confusing. We tell them that we give them gifts because 'we love you.' We give these things because 'we love you,' but they also hear 'he's making a list and checking it twice and he's gonna find out who's naughty or nice.' It's about coal or candy if you've been good, and at the same time we tell them 'these gifts are because we love you,' but at the same time they hear the message that it's not really a gift; it's a wage—you have to earn it. The complexity is what we've made it. I think as adults when we get to the other side of it, we understand all that but I'm not sure young minds are always able to differentiate that. What about those kids that are good and have been good all year but they still get coal—what's coal in their mind? It's because they don't really have anything else.
 
In America kids tend to collect more and more and more and more and Christmas even in my lifetime has gone so consumerism driven—I mean over the top. Consumers have been sold a bill of goods that this is what Christmas is and real Christmas is over-indulgence. And real Christmas is you have to buy more and more and more because your kids want more and more and more and more. I would ask the question about whether this in hindsight has really been good for us as a nation and as a people. We've created an appetite within our kids that is more and more and more and more and consumerism is really good at it because they heap guilt on us; they're good at heaping guilt on us if we don't overload every sensory that they have, then we're really not good parents. But then again, I ask the question, 'Has this been good for us?' Because I look around the world now and I see in our American culture—an entitlement culture. I see people who believe they should have because it's owed to them and this is what it's supposed to be and 'this is what is mine.'
 
In earlier times, it seemed to be simple. I did some research on it and earlier times, the origin of Christmas, people tended to exchange gifts that was more in line with the 'things that were needed'—not that you didn't give ""fun"" things—I don't mean that, but today it's 'don't give me a package of socks,' even if I don't have any socks, don't give me socks for Christmas. Give me a new phone. You know in cultures—they have really changed in this. Kids collect more and more and more and more of what they want, but not necessarily what they need. Even in spiritual things, we can find this wrestling match—219 boxes for Operation Christmas Child were sent from the Arcadia Christian Church—that's quite spectacular, I think. That's a pretty cool thing, especially if you're the one who doesn't have to load them all up and tow them around. What an awesome thing—219 boxes—what an awesome testimony, but if you did any of those, you feel that same wrestling match because on the list, so much of what is on the list, is stuff that they need. But to us, when we're buying that stuff, that doesn't seem very fun. And we're so conditioned that it has to be fun and we get torn with this idea 'I got to get all of this in this little box?' At the same time, in my mind I'm thinking, 'we want to get the things that are fun but what if that's at the exclusion of the things they really need?' The fun doesn't really matter if you never get to brush your teeth. You know our minds have been so tainted and so cluttered with complexity that even in those times when we do good things for people and I believe God blesses that immensely, sometimes it's still a wrestling match and not exactly the best way to go about that because of the complexity of life and the way we've made even Christmas complex.
 
Sometimes with God it's easy to sit and look around and say that God hasn't provided—that God hasn't provided for all of my needs. I would just have to say that for the majority of my experience with Americans and you know the primary experience I've had just talking with people has been here in the Midwest, but this whole idea of God hasn't really provided is more based upon not the fact that God hasn't provided but based upon the fact that we get too caught up in looking around at whatever everybody else has. We get too caught up looking around at what everybody else has and comparing ourselves to where everybody else is positionally and then for some reason we take that next step, even if we don't say it verbally in our hearts, we kind of blame God. Again, part of that is our consumeristic culture—they have conditioned us to think that way. I believe Satan has trained us to take us away from really a trust relationship with God and normally it's in little steps.
 
In James 4:1-4 Jesus' brother, James, says this: (JR read the passage.) I was thinking about that this week and I was thinking of how in this passage it says in our relationship with God we ask Him for things but don't receive and one of the reasons we don't receive is because we ask with the wrong motives and the motives that James talks about here are about us. You know somehow we have gotten it in our minds that God is the genie in the sky—that we just rub the lamp and presto—He'll give you the new car or give you the new house or give you the new cell phone that you want. You name it and God is supposed to be there and He's supposed to grant us our wishes and He's supposed to pop out and say 'I grant you 3 wishes' so we tell Him our first two and then we say what everybody would say with that 3rd wish which is 'I wish that these wishes would continue with no limit,' and I think one of the things is what we have to check is as Americans, what are our desires? When we approach God and we ask God for things—we're at this time of Christmas, so we make our lists and like I said, I think our lists tend to get shorter as we get older because we realize it's not really that important as we thought but we make our lists with God, what is our motivation in that? What is our motivation in that? Do I really approach God with the mindset of 'God just give me what I need,' rather than declaring to Him everything I need, 'Just give me—provide me with what I need?' You know it's amazing to me how many Christians in America live in utter despair it seems, if you talk to them and just constantly they don't have this and they don't have that. There are so many things that they don't have—so many needs we hear in America that are not met. But then you go to a place like Haiti and the joy that oozes out of people in a 3rd world country—I'm talking about Christians; I'm talking about people who have been infused with the Spirit of God and they're in places where they have nothing. You go into their homes and they offer you the only chair that they have; they sit on the ground and you sit in the chair. They make something—food—to share with you when their family may only eat 3 times in a week and they share what they have with joy. I often find myself wondering where that joy comes from. Why is it that people living in those conditions can be so delightful and so happy and so excited to share what they have with you and to share conversation with you even if it is through an interpreter and people in America tend to still not have enough? I'm as guilty as anyone; I mean it's just who we are. We have been conditioned this way, friends, and all I'm saying is I'm not sure it's a good thing.
 
It's not bad to approach God with things that we want; He's our Father—that's what we do. Jesus did that, but Jesus was also willing in His desires and in what He wanted, He was willing to submit to God's will at what was best for Him and not just for Him personally but what was best for everybody around Him. You know what if we were to train the next 2 or 3 generations of American children to be satisfied with what we have instead of craving more—instead of craving more and more and more and more. I was talking about this with some friends the other day of how many times we've all seen it probably. We've gone to great lengths to buy things for that young 2-year old in the family and he's finally old enough that he can rip open the gift and we get him all these gifts and the family is all there and excited because he's got this one and this one and this one and when it's all done, he sits in the box with a bow on his head playing with the wrapping paper because at that age he is perfectly content to be in that box—what a cool thing! 'Look, I can disappear in this box.' He doesn't care about the extravagance of all the toys and all the stuff, but we train him to think that's what he needs.
 
I just think it's sad. I think it's sad that we've become a people who have lost what it means to be content in all situations. I honestly don't say that as a criticism as much as I do an observation. And I do because I am getting older and probably because things that seemed important to me 20 years ago aren't as important to me now. As life evolves for me I see life passing and I look back and I see the importance of God and the way He interacts in our lives and being grateful to Him for giving me what I need. You see, Leigh Ann and I understand what it means to have the gift of a child. I'm not saying no one else in here does; I'm saying Leigh Ann and I understand that. Three years of infertility and praying and praying that God would fulfill the desires of our hearts, we understand what it means to be given a gift that we had no control over and learning to be content in that and learning to understand that God does fulfill the desires of our hearts and it's not always in the way we anticipate it happening but that He does. I've also come to the realization that sometimes God keeps us in the place where we are because it keeps us in a position to need Him. Sometimes when we walk through this life and we feel like there are things we need that He's not providing, if we had all that stuff, we wouldn't need Him so much and because that's constantly there and we're constantly drawn to a relationship with Him that He will be the one who provides those things incrementally as we need it. I find that the rich man doesn't often need God because He has everything or so he thinks he has everything until he comes to the end and he realizes he doesn't have everything because he doesn't have the power through money to sustain life. Eventually that catches up with us all.
 
In the time of Miriam (Mary) what did Israel desire? What was it that Israel wanted? Israel wanted a deliverer. We've talked about that the last few weeks. Israel wanted and desired a deliverer. They wanted someone who could stand up to that crazy Herod; they wanted someone who could stand up to Herod the Great and stand for them. What Israel wanted was someone who could stand up even beyond Herod and stand up to Caesar—and to stand up to Rome because Rome was there as occupiers of their land and although Rome had given them pretty much a great freedom to express their Jewishness the way they wanted, Rome was still Rome and Rome was in charge and Israel didn't like it. They wanted a deliverer.
 
In Luke 1:30-31 the Angel Gabriel said to Mary: (JR read it.)  God gave them socks! They wanted a warrior; God gives them a baby. They wanted one who would take care of them; He gives them one who needs to be taken care of. But in this picture, God gave them what they wanted, too, but here we are again in fast-food America—I want it now, America. God gave them in that babe in swaddling clothes--He gave them a Redeemer—He gave them a Deliverer—He gave them One who would way surpass Herod the Great or any Caesar that ever lived—it's just the timeframe. You see that's where a lot of time we bog down, I think, because we don't like to wait. We don't like to have to give God the permission to allow circumstances in life to unfold the way He sees fit; we think we know the time schedule and when everything should happen and we're quick to say 'God, it says right here in the daytime or next Friday this is what's supposed to be going on.' We think we have it all scheduled but sometime we're clueless in the scheduling. A few weeks ago I said something to Josiah Wallace and he said, 'Are you going to come to school and have lunch with me?' I said, 'Sure.' He's a little fellow and I asked him 'When do you want to do it?' He thought for a minute and then said, 'Um—Tuesday,' like he was checking his plan book or something. He didn't know if Tuesday was a good day or not, but that's probably the first thing that popped into his mind; I liked the simplicity but at the same time, I thought 'he has no idea.' He is scheduling his life away and had no idea if Tuesday's a good day or not. And we adults are the same way; we force feed our schedules to God and think 'I need this now.' 'You know God, it's on my list.' But you know, real faith is the surrender of that stuff. Real faith is trusting God in doing what He says He will do. ""Seek first His Kingdom,"" and He will provide all the stuff we need. But in reality, we look for Him to provide the stuff we need and then we seek His Kingdom.
 
What gift could we give to God this year? You know last week I talked about the best gift you can give your family is to find favor with God. What's the best gift that we can give on another realm? Can we surrender? Can we surrender our wish list, not that we don't have it, but that we surrender it and say 'Lord, these are my desires, but you go down through the list that fit me best—that's what I want.' You see, Israel, they struggled with that. He gave them what they wanted even though they didn't know it because it wasn't in the right time that He would reveal Himself as the One who would stand as King. His First Coming He came as a sacrifice; He left to go back to Heaven but He left His Spirit. Oh, He will come and He will come back and He will make His Kingdom permanent but again, that's on His time frame. Are we willing to surrender that?
 
Friends, I give you these thoughts this morning as encouragement to you'' You know you've heard that thing about 'keep the main thing the main thing,' but I always think 'What's the main thing?' It's a nice slogan but what is the main thing? To me today's main thing in this message is again, surrendering to God—our wants, our desires, our needs—surrendering, saying 'God, you lead and I will follow.' See, we've been trying to lead and let Him follow for a long time and I look where we are and it doesn't seem to be jiving. So maybe, just maybe this Christmas we give God the steering wheel back and us get in the backseat and let Him drive for a while and see how that turns out. Let's pray.
Closing Prayer – God, we wanted a king and you gave a baby; we wanted a deliverer and you gave a sacrificial lamb and Lord, we didn't understand that through that sacrificial lamb that you would deliver. Lord, help us to not be so smart that we think we know everything. Lord, help us to submit to your plan according to your calendar. Lord, I pray for parents and grandparents in here and that whole manipulation thing that our consumer-oriented culture has done to us that this whole idea of parents feeling guilty if they don't pile on more and more and more stuff. Lord, I know it's hard because our kids are going to go to school and the other kids will be talking about all the massive amount of stuff they got and we don't want our kids to be hurt or left out or made fun of and Lord, even if it isn't a conscious guilt sometimes that is a thing that drives us deeply and I pray, Lord, that we would have the strength and the knowledge and the wisdom to be a generation that starts to teach our culture back to contentment rather than more and more and more. Lord, there is nothing wrong with gifts; even the wise men brought gifts to Jesus, but when the gifts are the driving force, it's probably a lack of priority. So God, I just pray that you would help us to be content with you and that through Christmas you would teach us back to you and teach us back to your Son who would give His life as a sacrifice. God, I thank you that through Jesus you provided the way to a restored relationship with you. I thank you that through trust in Him, Lord, that you can fix our spiritual woes. Lord, I pray that if there is anyone in here today who needs to surrender and who needs to come to trust Jesus, Lord, I pray that today might be a day of salvation. Lord, thank you and it's in Jesus' Name we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",12/11/2016,
"I did a search this week on the subject of ""fear""—fear and being afraid and I looked at a lot of different things. I found a thing from ""Time"" magazine that gave the top 10 internet searches that included ""fear of"" and those top 10 searches recorded by ""Time"" magazine were these: #10 was the fear of being alone; #9 was the fear of success; #8 was the fear of God; (and when I read that I immediately thought how that should be #1, but at least it did make the top 10 in a pretty secular world in which we live.­) #7 was the fear of love; #6 was the fear of driving; #5 was the fear of spiders; #4 was the fear of death; #3 was the fear of the dark; #2 was the fear of intimacy; and #1, which kind of struck me as funny, but the #1 searched thing, according to ""Time"" magazine during the period that they wrote this article was the fear of flying. The reason it struck me as funny is really, no one is scared of flying—it's the falling part—it's the unexpected descent that we're really scared of, I think. But you think about the fears, and as I thought about it this week, the list of ""fears"" is endless—literally!  It's endless! We have the fear of being seen as ""weak,"" the fear of ""losing status,"" the fear of ""not getting our own way,"" the fear of the ""unknown;"" we have the fear of ""losing,"" the fear of ""other or different races or religions or beliefs,"" the fear of ""rejection,"" the fear of ""losing a loved one,"" and sometimes in connection with that, the fear of ""holidays or celebration because of the loss of a loved one,""—one of the articles that I read said that women's biggest fear, across the board, is the fear of ""walking alone on a city street at night."" In the same article men's biggest fear was a ""traffic violation,"" which I thought was rather funny and probably didn't do a whole lot for the research in my mind if that was their biggest fear. There was the fear of ""yearly doctors' visits and check-ups,"" the fear of what we talked about before when the pilot comes over the airplane speaker and gives the warning of ""turbulence ahead,"" and in the same article 6% of people had a real fear of ""answering the telephone if it has no caller ID on it.""  Listed was a fear of ""clowns,"" a fear of ""commitment,"" a fear of the ""dentist,"" a fear of ""needles,"" a fear of ""speaking in public,"" and in one of the articles I read, the wrath that is feared by most is 57% fear the ""wrath of God,"" more than any other person--15% fear the ""wrath of their spouse,"" 11% the ""wrath of their parents,"" 7% the ""wrath of their boss,""—as far as fear of ""foreign powers"" goes, ISIS was 38% the highest that people have a fear of, 29% of people fear ""China,"" 19% of people fear ""Russia,"" and 2% of people fear ""WikiLeaks.""
 
Fear is real and it hits each of us differently—different times—different places—different ways. We could be asked the question the thing that we fear the most and we could answer it, but a month later, that might be different and we might give a different answer then, depending upon life's circumstances at that time.
 
""When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom, she took some and she ate it."" (JR continued reading Genesis 3:6-10.)  Adam said ""I was afraid""--the beginning of fear—the beginning of fear. The beginning of fear is rooted in our brokenness with God. I truly believe that before that moment, there was no such thing in the world as ""fear."" But it's when we decided—it's when mankind decided to walk apart from God that we inherited our brokenness, our broken state, our state of rebellion--the mindset of shaking our fist at God and saying ""I will do it my way in my time,"" the world changed. All the fear that we know—all the fear that we have—all the anger and the rage—the deception—the isolation—the vindictiveness—ultimately death—all of the things that we fear are rooted in our brokenness. It is rooted in man's desire to walk alone apart from God. The theme of the Bible, and you can find it pretty much in every book from Genesis to Revelation, ""I am the God of your father, Abraham; do not be afraid."" Oh, it is said in different ways at different times to different people, but the theme of the Bible is ""I am the God of your father, Abraham; do not be afraid."" Adam, in the beginning, was afraid because he heard the steps of God and he knew he stood in brokenness and because he stood in brokenness, he had the fear of seeing God.
 
Psalm 27:1 (JR read it.) The word ""salvation"" is Yeshua, so it says ""The Lord is my light and my Yeshua—whom shall I fear?"" Psalm 56:3-4 says this: (JR read it.)  The theme of the Bible is that we have fear instilled within us; it's a part of our nature now; it's a part of who we are and it hits people differently at different time in different ways, but fear is a part of who we are and from Genesis through Revelation God is trying to communicate to us that 'I have come to take away your fear by repairing our relationship.' The cure to fear is not counting to 10; the cure to fear is not going out and taking a long walk and meditating, though the prayer could help. The cure to fear is a restored relationship with God.
 
In Joshua 1, Joshua at the end of Torah, (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy)—when we left the Torah a few weeks ago, we left a Nation sitting on one side of the Jordan River ready to cross it and take new territory, ready to go to a place that had been promised to them decades before, but it was not going to be their fearless leader, Moses, who wasn't really fearless, but people probably saw him as fearless; they probably admired him and thought he was brave (which he was brave) but he wasn't ""fearless,"" because he had fears just like the rest of us—the difference is that as he walked closely with God, he was able to overcome his fears, but now Moses is not going to be the one, the man of courage and the one they have looked up to and admired and the one that they followed, the one who has brought a Nation out of bondage and who has led them through 40 difficult years but now as they get ready to go into the land, Moses is not going to be a part of it but it's going to be handed off to a young man named Joshua, or Yeshua. And in the first chapter of Joshua he is told over and over and over by God to ""be strong and courageous,"" ""do not be afraid,"" ""do not lose courage because the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go."" ""Be strong and courageous,"" ""be strong and courageous,"" ""do not fear,""—why does God keep telling him over and over and over to ""be strong and courageous,"" ""do not be afraid,"" and ""do not fear,""—why?--because Joshua was afraid. If someone is not afraid, then there is no reason to tell him to not be afraid. If someone's not going to be afraid at some point, there is no reason to tell him not to be afraid. But Joshua was like the rest of us; he inherited a sin nature and along with that comes the fear of snakes, and spiders, and heights, and death and isolation and loneliness and all of those things. Joshua was going to be leading people in a way much the same as Abraham's father had done. Abraham, in the book of Hebrews 11 is revered because he was a man of faith who followed and chased God and was obedient to God even though he didn't know where he was going. God said, ""Go,""—Abraham said ""Where?"" and God said, ""Trust me."" God said, ""Go,""—you said ""Where?"" and God said, ""Trust me,"" but that's not really the answer we like. When God says, ""Go,"" and we say ""Where?"" we want to hear Him say ""Tipton,"" or ""Noblesville,"" or ""To the mall,""—we want a definite destination—that's what we want, but God just says ""Go."" God says ""Go as I lead you,"" ""Go as I nudge you,"" but we have a fear of that—why do we have a fear of that? Because we live in brokenness. Now I want you to think for a minute—if we totally, fully, fully, trust the One who sends us, even if we don't know where we're going, are we fearful? Meditate on that a little bit this week. If we fully, fully trust the One who sends us, there is no fear in going even if we don't know where the destination is. WE FEAR BECAUSE WE FAIL!  We fear because our humanity sometimes doesn't allow us to trust God to the extent that we need to.
 
In Luke 1:26-30 (JR started reading, pausing after Verse 28.) Last week we discussed why Mary? Why was Mary chosen? And ultimately it was because of the humility of her life that she had surrendered herself to God and last week I asked the question ""Why not Mary?"" and ""Why not you?"" ""Why not me?"" Why do we always assume that God is going to use someone else? How about us laying our lives out at the feet of God and saying ""God, why not me?"" (JR then resumed reading the passage with Verse 29.) He said, ""Do not be afraid,"" to Mary. ""You have found favor with God.""
 
The key to overcoming fear in our lives, no matter what that fear happens to be, is a restored relationship with God. ""Mary, do not be afraid; you have found favor with God."" Friends, the greatest Christmas gift that you could ever give yourself or your family is to find favor with God—to find favor with God because as you find favor with God, your fears will fall to the side. Your fears will fall to the side. How many of us have fears that we inherited? To be quite honest, and there are a lot of us in here that do and don't even realize it. If your parent freaked out every time they saw a spider—why is it that I see family members patting their loved ones saying ""I'm sorry?"" If you as a child saw people around you freak out every time they saw a spider, guess what happens kind of naturally? We inherit those same things. That's very simplistic, but it can be a lot deeper too in our psyche. There can be some very complex things. If you have grown up in a household where there is a fear of trust, and there is no trust because there is a fear of trust, because of getting hurt, you grow up learning to what?—to not trust! You grow up learning to not trust and then when it comes to the words of Jesus, ""Do not let your hearts be troubled; trust in God and trust also in me,"" guess what happens? You won't do that. 'I don't trust.' It's not always on a conscious level, but we just learn that. The greatest gift you can give your family is to find favor with God. How do we find favor with God? We find favor with God through surrender. We find favor with God through surrender. God offered His Son as the gift to the world and the only way I can accept the Son is accepting me for who I am and that's that I am a sinner and that I fall short and that I deserve to go to hell. It is through surrender; it's through humility that we find favor with God, but as long as we shake our fists and say ""I will do it my way in my time,"" fear will continue to boil.  Now I'm not naive enough to think that this side of Heaven that all fear will be stripped away. We will continue to struggle with it, but you can overcome.
 
Your Christmas gift this year, I challenge you to give, won't be found in any store. It will be found in that quiet moment between you and the God of all creation and how you handle yourself with Him.
 
Thursday night Shanna and I went to see the movie ""Hacksaw Ridge."" I have been wanting to see it and then I had people tell me 'You really should go see it.' It's the story of Desmond Doss who was in WWII—the Battle of Okinawa—he was a conscientious objector who wanted to serve but he didn't want to carry a gun—he didn't want to fight—he just wanted to help. And as I watched that movie, if you've seen ""Saving Private Ryan,"" it's very similar in nature, and as I watched that movie, I was reminded of the evil of mankind. I was just flabbergasted with what men will do to each other and the evil presence that is in this world. But I was also reminded of a loving Savior who walked out of Heaven into all of this hate—into all of this anger—into all of this rage and was willing to give His life on a tree.  Just like Desmond Doss was willing to go and to serve and to risk his life on behalf of other soldiers. He was willing to risk not knowing what was going to happen to him.  Jesus came knowing; He came knowing that He was going to be nailed to a cross so that right there on that cross with Him, all of the fears that we have could be nailed because of restored relationships. Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Abba, we live in a hate-filled world; it's not absent of your love but sometimes it feels like it because it just feels like the enemy is winning. And Lord, we are a people who fear, and this wasn't the original place I was going to go in today's message, but God, the more I looked at it, the more I heard, I believe, your Voice—the Christmas promise to Mary that started with ""Do not be afraid; do not fear because God has found favor with you."" Lord, if one day as we all will unless Jesus returns beforehand—as we all someday will surrender our physical bodies, Lord, what a blessing that it might be written on our tombstones—each of us—that we ""have found favor with God."" Lord, help us to understand that all the fear—all of the struggle that we have in life is rooted around fear; Lord, you are in control of that and it's the restored relationship with you where we can gain freedom. Lord, I pray for those in here who have been held captive far too long and I pray that we might understand it's not a battle of our fear of reptiles; it's not a battle of our fear of heights or public speaking; it's a battle of reconnection with You. God, I pray that we might choose You the way that You have chosen us. Lord, I pray that if there is anyone in here today who is outside of a relationship with You, Lord that we might understand that Christmas begins here. It begins with a relationship; it begins finding favor. Lord, thank you for loving us and thank you for giving us second, third, fourth, and fifth chances. Thank you for this salvation that Yeshua, we find in You—that Jesus, we find in You. God bless the rest of our time here this morning and if there is anyone in here who needs to make a decision/commitment to have today be a day of surrender, Lord, I pray that we might wave a white flag in the Name of Jesus, Amen.

"The world is at war; it's not something most of us would choose—most of us would rather have peace but war is something that is part of the world in which we chose to live when we shook our fists at God and said 'We'll do things on our own; we'll do it our own way.' Since that time in Genesis 3, the world has struggled. We have struggled with relationships; we've struggled with peace—we've struggled with all kinds of things. It's just part of the world in which we live on this side of the return of Jesus and we do appreciate those who have stood on our behalf and on behalf of our families.
 
In the wake of the assassination of Julius Caesar, the Roman Kingdom was reeling; we talked about this last week. In the wake of Julius Caesar's assassination, the Roman Kingdom was reeling in despair, confusion and unrest. People were struggling—now the Roman Kingdom was big—it was broad; there were other little sub-kingdoms. In Judea, Herod the Great led the people of a Nation—the Israelites—which was not by their choice. It wasn't by their choice but he was their leader—their leader by appointment and it was in the midst of this unrest that God started to cultivate His answer. It was in the midst of this unrest that He would ultimately appear to Mary and to tell her that through her life the world was going to change and that something that she would bring forth things were going to be different. During that time the Israelites struggled. They struggled because they were under foreign occupation, but they were used to this. They were very familiar with this struggle in life. They were a people who were born in a foreign country; they were a people who were born in Egypt. They were a people who had wandered and lived as refugees and who had walked in the wilderness for years. They were a people who had finally settled in their land, but instead of finding peace, they were a people who had been ravaged by war over and over and over. They were a people who had been taken captive and taken captive into other countries and now at this time—at the time of young Miriam (Mary) they were a country occupied by the Romans. They were worn; they were weary; they were disillusioned and they were struggling—they were in need of restoration. They were in need of redemption; they were in need of a Savior. They were in need of a new way.
 
Last week as I introduced this Christmas Promises sermon series, I said that this world in which they lived under Herod the Great, or last week I was talking he was the not-so-great, crazy king Herod. It's much like us today really and I talked about that last week and this past week has made our current situation evident as to where we are as a country—where we are as a people. We are a people in turmoil; we are a people in confusion; we are a people who are struggling and we are a people in need of restoration—we are a people in need of redemption. The question is: what will happen?—not with the Nation of Israel, but what will happen with the United States? What will happen? Where will we go? Those questions remain to be answered, but there is no doubt that we are a nation in turmoil. We are a nation dazed and confused.
 
While the smoke was still rising from the City of Jerusalem; they had been invaded by the Babylonians led by King Nebuchadnezzar. It had been a process over several years—the deconstruction of Israel, the Southern Kingdom. The Northern Kingdom some 150 years ago had been taken into captivity by the Assyrians and now the Southern Kingdom of Judah, and with the smoke still rising from Jerusalem in Lamentations 4:11-13, the Prophet Jeremiah, as he laments the destruction of the City of Jerusalem says this: (JR read the passage.) Now don't in any way, shape or form claim that we, as the United States, stand representative of Jerusalem or Israel. But we are a nation, who has a vast amount of people, who claim to be followers of Jesus. We are a nation, who from our origins and our foundations claimed a relationship with God to some degree. We were built on Christian principles. Our laws are built upon Biblical principles. It's really kind of shocking when you go through our laws and read them—I did this a few years ago with an attorney friend and tried to compare some of our laws today with Biblical laws. We have that model, but the Nation of Israel goes up in smoke and God says it was 'because of the sins of the prophets and the priests.' It was because of the sins of the prophets and the priests. And it would be easy for us—it would be easy for me—well, I guess it wouldn't be so easy for me to say this, but it would be easy for us as a people to point to the Nation and say 'the prophets and the priests—they were the leaders; they were the ones in charge; the spiritual leaders are the ones at fault.' It wouldn't be so easy for me because I stand in that role now, but I will tell you this. I will tell you that when you get to the times of the apostles that Peter said, 'We as followers of Jesus are a kingdom of priests and priestesses.' If you are a follower of Jesus, you have a responsibility. If you claim the Name of Jesus and if you claim it as a Bible follower, then your proclamation is that you are an ambassador of Him and that you stand as representative for Him and because of that it is really important that we speak as Jesus would have us to speak and say things that Jesus would have us to say and not say things as He would have us not to say.
 
The smoke was still rising from Jerusalem as Jeremiah lamented the downfall of a people, because the people were lost. They had lost their connection to God. Notice it wasn't the secular Israelites that He pointed the finger at; He pointed it at the ones who were in a position and who were supposed to be walking with God. He pointed at them as the cause for the downfall of their nation.
 
Friends, we have a responsibility. In today's world we are called to be peacemakers. We are called by Jesus to be peacemakers, but in today's world we can't hardly be a peacemaker. I had someone talk to me about that this week and I said, 'I can't hardly even be a peacemaker because anything I say makes somebody mad.' I was thinking about that and why is it that anything I say trying to make peace makes somebody mad? Part of it is because we live in a social media spiritual world of the Photoshop Gospel. Alright? We live in a social media spiritual world of the Photoshop Gospel and what I mean by that is oh, you can say the old terminology of 'cut and paste' but that is the Gospel in which we tend to live; we cut and paste; we Photoshop the parts of Scripture we want; Photoshop them and we put them in our lives and use them as a Billy club to beat people with them all at the same time leaving out other relevant information because it doesn't fit our own agenda. That is a scary place to be, friends. You see this has been something I've trumpeted for decades now. We are either Bible believing Christians, which means Genesis to Revelation or we're not. We need to be really careful with our Photoshop agenda that might be shaped by a Biblical world view or it might not. It might be shaped by society. It might be shaped by a cultural push. I believe what our Nation needs right now is to look 'in house' for healing. And when I say 'in house' I'm not talking about 'in house' within our nation; I'm talking about within the body of believers. If our nation is going to experience true healing, and true restoration, I believe it has to start within the church—within the body of believers, because we are the ones who have grace that's been extended to us and we are the ones who have access to what it means to be truly redeemed. The bottom line: if the Kingdom of priests don't get it, the likelihood of the rest of our Nation getting it is very slim. Let me say this as bluntly as I can say it. If you voted for Hillary Clinton, you are bad. If you voted for Donald Trump, you are bad. If I took my vote last week like I said I wanted to do and wrote in the Name of Jesus as my write-in vote, I am bad. The Scriptures are clear: 'There is no one good; not one.' It doesn't make any difference who you voted for or if you didn't vote at all, the Scriptures are clear: you are bad! Now I'm going to tell you that is not politically correct. There are some preachers who will avoid that statement at all costs because we live in a 'feel good' society, but I will tell you the Scriptures are clear: 'All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.' You are a sinner and thus, you are bad. Bad people can do good things. It doesn't mean that you don't do any good things because sometimes God can work through us to do good things, but in our core—in our nature, we are bad—'there is no one good, no not one.' I bring that out because I've read all week that if I voted this way or if I voted that way, I'm bad and then I'm this and I'm that because I voted a certain way—but you know what? I acknowledge that—I agree. I am a sinner! I am bad! And so is the person I voted for. He or she is bad, too. We live in a country that is dying because we don't either listen or accept the truth. And it's not just as a country, but I believe that spiritually within the church and this is not just one-sided. I see it if it's red, blue, green, purple, yellow—I see people Photo shopping their agenda all over the place on both sides, throwing darts, throwing bombs, throwing nuclear weapons, throwing all kinds of things out there thus creating all kinds of chaos and almost every single one of them I could refute Biblically and these are being thrown out there by people who profess to be followers of Jesus. We are creating more chaos by Photoshop Christianity Evangelism. Some may not like it that I address this kind of thing, but you know what?—frankly, I don't care. I really don't. I don't, and I'm sorry if that sounds mean—I don't mean it to sound mean—I'm just being honest. We need people in this world to make an honest assessment of where we are. Look at the world we are handing to our children. Look at the spiritual world that we're handing to our children. We're teaching our children to go through the Scriptures, pick out selective verses to use in order to prove our agenda, where it might be in line with the heart of Jesus or it might not. The thing that really bothers me is that it doesn't really seem to matter. We just pick and choose. 
 
There is no one good—not one of us—so now what do we do? What are we left with? It's easy to point that out—at least I think it is. I mean I know my own faults. We may even stand before people and say 'No, I am good,' but then we hide a lot of things in our closet so that no one will see them—well, why do we hide them? Because they show we're not good. We say, 'I've nothing to hide,' but if we come up front and we pull people out of the paths of your life that maybe you didn't know that we knew and they appear that they will have a 'tell-all,' then all of a sudden, we start sweating a little bit. So where does that leave us?
 
This is a joyful service; look around at all of these bad people. There's no one good in here! Only by the grace of God can I do anything good. He's going to make me good someday. Someday He's going to win this war and man it is a war in the heart of ole JR; it is a war. If He wins this war, He is King!
 
In Micah 6:1-7 we find these words. (JR read the passage.) And that 6th verse is the question we need to ask. What can I bring to God? I am a bad person; there is no one good—no not one. My sin stands between me and God. I stand opposed to Him; I stand as His enemy—I stand as a rebel—what can I possibly bring? Yes, I know there is Jesus and I know the transformation that He is able to give me; I struggle with it because why is it if He brings that transformation now and if this New Testament has fully renovated me and changed me, why is it that I struggle so much with doing what's right? Because I'm still a work in progress. What is it that I can bring to satisfy the anger of God? What is it that I can bring? I will agree to teach children's Sunday school for one year, and that will appease the frustration of God. That's how shallow we are. I believe that—I don't think we intentionally try to be that shallow, but we tend to fall into this thinking that we appease the anger of God by the things that we do. But it will never be the things that we do that satisfies the anger of God; it can only come through the death of His Son who can cleanse us of our sin. But in the midst of this question, while God is saying, 'Look back—I brought you up out of Egypt,'—what Egypt has He brought you out of? We all have our own personal Egypts. The life of the story of Israel is very transferrable to our individual lives in the way that they went through the processes of rebellion and being lost and being saved and then struggling again only to climb back out of the pit to struggle again.
 
The Prophet Micah says this in Verse 8 of that last passage. (JR read that verse.) If worship—our worship—what is it that God requires of us—what is it that God desires from us?  First it is to act justly—it's to act justly—to bring justice, and I believe that's what a lot of the world thinks they're doing on spiritualized social media. But really again, is it really bringing Jesus justice? Or is it cut and paste, or Photoshop—take a snippet here and take a snippet there? You know in coaching, do you know one of the things that absolutely drives me crazy?—it's when I get a referee that does not know the rules. I understand missed calls as that's life, you know he thought it was a foul—I didn't think so, but when referees don't know the rules—they are standing there with the whistle and with the shirt that looks like they should be in jail and they're the ones putting me in jail with decisions from that whistle and they are wrong because they don't even know the rules. You know my frustration is how do I teach my players? What do you teach them? If this referee is arbitrarily going to call this and make up his own rules as he goes along and okay, then I go back to practice and I teach this is the way we're going to do this and then the next referee actually knows the rules—do you understand where I'm at with that?
Well, it's frustrating and we as believers have often, I believe, left the world in frustration because we have people from the right and the left shouting different messages of cut and paste, Photoshop Gospel, little bitty snippets here, little bitty snippets there all the while we ignore the elephant in the room which is the hypocrisy that exists on both sides and we endorse it.
 
Let me ask you a question. If you were to go back and look at the last two months of what you have posted on social media—if Jesus was sitting with you, every time you hit ""post"" or ""send,""—if He was sitting with you, would that have happened? Because a big part of what He would be saying is 'What is your motive?' You know if anybody ever had the right to come in wielding a club and beating people half to death because they were right, it was Him. So, my friends, if you are going to use ""act justly"" thing to wield a club, at least read the rule book, because it's very frustrating to the people in the game when they get different referees calling different things because of different rules.
 
""Act justly,"" followed by what? ""Love mercy."" Act justly but love mercy. What is mercy? Mercy is me refraining from pouring out vengeance upon one who deserves it. Oh, wait a minute. That's kind of counter culture to the argument I just made about acting justly and wielding that club. It doesn't mean that we don't tell the truth. There are times when justice and passion is justified. Jesus went into the Temple; He saw what they were doing to the Temple and He did what?—He started throwing tables and chickens and whatever else was in sight. Maybe not chickens! Maybe pigeons and doves. But here's the thing. How many times comparatively throughout the life of Jesus did He show that kind of passion and justice and club wielding compared to the times that He said, 'Who has condemned you?' to which she responded, 'No one,' and then He replied 'Neither do I.' Which way do we see Jesus reveal Himself more? Now the other side of that is Jesus this passionate love-God who came down from Heaven and didn't acknowledge that people were sinners and didn't acknowledge that people made mistakes and didn't draw lines in the sand? Absolutely not! To those same people, He would say, 'Neither do I condemn you, but go and leave your life of sin'—quit living like that. But it's an attitude—it's the way that we do it. Act justly, love mercy—how do you do that? You walk humbly. You walk humbly—before and with God, you walk humbly. Now, if you hadn't noticed, in this last election, there was enough arrogance on all sides to fill up many centuries. My honest prayer this week—not that God listens to me more than anybody else—but my honest prayer this week, and I prayed it last week in here—God, bring us the person who will bring us to our knees. It might not be exactly the way I said it but that's where we are; we need as a people to be brought to our knees. Our salvation isn't dependent on one nation under God in the sense of being this one nation the United States; our salvation and our redemption is about us being ""under God."" I don't care what your nationality is.  Friends, that's just an honest assessment of where I believe that we are. And you know what? I said last week 'we need to vote,' but more than voting, we need to what?—we need to pray. A lot more than posting on social media, we need to pray. A lot more than arguing with people at the lunch table, we need to pray. I think out of all this time, I made one political post and it was in response to a question someone asked me. It doesn't make me any better than anybody else; I just know that I'm so passionate, I'm not sure I can control myself, so it's better for me not to walk through that door than to have to try to restrain myself once I'm in the room.
 
But there is hope! And the hope is Christmas Promises. Next week we'll be doing Thanksgiving; next Sunday we'll be doing our ""praise and share"" time—our typical Thanksgiving Service and I pray that it will be awesome, as always—that you all come in and you evaluate the last year of life and how God has blessed you and that you come in and be willing to share your hearts in that like we have for 15 years, and in the following weeks leading up to Christmas we'll be getting more in detail into these promises that God made through Gabriel to Miriam, to Mary, that there is hope and there is good.
 
Yesterday I was wanting to take a nap and Shanna came to my room and said, ""Dad, we need to go do some shopping—tomorrow's the day—Operation Christmas Child, so we have to get that stuff done."" You know I'm sweating over how many shoeboxes she has stored away in her closet, so I answered ""Well, give me a little while."" So last night we headed down and as soon as we pull into the driveway of Walmart—pulling into the parking spot, Shanna said, ""Look, Dad, he goes to our church."" So I get out and saw it was Randy Crook. I started laughing and said to him, ""We're just here doing our early Christmas child shopping,"" and he opens his bag and that's what he was doing. To be honest with you, it made my night. I thought, 'Here's one of our elders who is out shopping. His kids are grown and have left the house and he's out shopping.' We go in the store and see one more person in there that I know; it's also another man from Arcadia Christian Church. He is toting his cart and I'm looking in there and see crayons and coloring books and I kind of laughed and we stood there and talked. He came back around a little while later and found me again and he's carrying a stuffed bear and says, ""I have to get out of here."" Of course, Shanna's got the cart going up and down every aisle and you know what?—I thought that's where we need to be as a people. We need to be a people who are willing to give what we have and we have something really special. It is the hope we have because of what Jesus did and because of what God the Father gave up. He gave it all!  Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Father, thank you; I thank you that we have such a giving congregation. I look up here at the front and see all these shoeboxes. I think last year it was 173 or something like that that was sent out just from this church by people who care. God, I pray that you help us to prioritize and I pray that you help us to look back and evaluate and see what the condition of the world is that we are living in. Help us to make decisions based upon knowledge—knowledge of the Scriptures. Help us to show restraint in times when we really need to keep our mouths shut because we would be more divisive if we say this or if we say that. Help us to have boldness in those times that we need to speak up. God help us; give us discernment and help us to be more like Jesus. The world needs to see a lot less of Hillary Clinton—a lot less Donald Trump, and a lot less other people and they need to see a lot more of the authentic Jesus—not our Photoshop Jesus, but the Jesus of the Bible. Lord, that's more than just a statement; that's also an attitude and a spirit. Lord, we are bad! We are bad; we are sinners. Lord, we thank you for the grace you have given us through Jesus so that we might stand before you in His righteousness. Lord, if there is anyone in here today who needs to repent, who needs to turn back to you, who needs to find a friend to pray with, who needs to surrender their lives to you, who needs to enter the water of baptism; Lord, whatever it is, I pray today would be a day of renewal. In the Name of Jesus we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",11/13/2016,
"What a great day and weekend it was and I hope that you were able to be here to be a part of that and I think those pictures captured a lot—really, a lot, as God, I believe, spoke into the lives of those who attended. I thank so many people who had so many different parts in making last weekend the success it was. It was a big deal. I know some came on Sunday morning to worship and leave but it's a little more complicated than that; a lot of people put in a lot of hours and I really appreciate Heather—this was really her dream. She told me a year ago this was something she really wanted to do and I appreciate her really sticking to it and I remember telling her at that time, 'Well, you're doing it.' I told her I would help her but it was her thing and she did and she did a great job with it. So I hope you will give her some encouragement in that also.
 
Today, Highway 67 starts for this month and I'm excited about that and honestly I almost didn't prepare a message for today because I didn't think we would actually be here today. This past week when the Cubs won the World Series, I thought it was all over. I mean the way that this thing unfolded with the Cubs manager, Joe Madden, kind of playing the role of the anti-Christ for a while and some of the decisions he was making—Cubs fans losing their minds and then, even as it got to that point, I realized that this team had been assembled by Theo Epstein, a Jewish man, so I assumed he would be able to assemble a team that would save the day. It was just a very interesting week, obviously for those who are Cubs fans. Anybody in here remember the last Cubs World Series? Given your age I thought maybe a couple of you do. (Here there was laughter.) How about the story of the guy who drove from North Carolina to sit in the cemetery in Greenwood and listened to the game on the radio at the grave of his father? Isn't it funny how different things can take people to the connection in life that is of vital importance to relationships?
 
Relationships! And that is what God has called us here for. He has called us here for relationships going back all the way to the time of Moses and the giving of the Torah; it was about relationships. It was about God descending from the heavens onto Mt. Sinai to communicate to the Jewish people and to the world that He wanted a relationship—that He desired a relationship—the relationship had been broken back in Genesis 3 because of man's rebellion. We left off at the end of the Torah with the death of Moses; Moses dies—he goes up into the mountains and is buried by God and the next thing we have is Joshua with the handed off baton—it's a big baton handed to Joshua and it's his turn now to carry it and lead the people into the Promised Land and through the conquest of the land as a military general.
 
The times of Joshua was followed by the times of the judges—some 350 year period or so where Israel was led by a different host of judges—where Israel went through repentance and rebellion and all of the stuff over and over and over through a continual cycle. Eventually at the end of the judges God gave them their first king because that was their demand; it was them that wanted a king and they wanted one now because they wanted to be like all the other nations who had a king and so from the tribe of Benjamin Saul was appointed King of Israel. It was a disaster. He was followed by King David who was God's chosen and David was followed by his son, Solomon. Solomon then had two who followed him; Jeroboam and Rehoboam. They split the kingdom; they divided the people and I tell you God has built us for relationships and those relationships are best lived out when they're intact and not divided and not split. The kingdom split creating all kinds of problems. The 10 northern tribes became Israel or the Northern Kingdom led by Jeroboam. The Southern Kingdom, led by Rehoboam took on the name of Judah because the tribe of Judah was there—it consisted of Judah and Benjamin and basically the tribe of Levi. In 722 B.C. the Northern Kingdom was taken captive by the Assyrians in the north. Judah withstood that and they remained. In 605 B.C. there were actually three different deportations of the Southern Kingdom when they were defeated by King Nebuchadnezzar—605, 597, 586 B.C.--the Southern Kingdom of Judah was taken captive into the land of Babylon. Some 70 years later after the Babylonians had ended their kingdom it was during the times of the Medes and Persians divided a split kingdom; they defeated the Babylonians. It was during that time that the tribe of Judah and the people of Judah in the Southern Kingdom made their way back to Jerusalem led by Nehemiah, Ezra, and Zerubbabel among others. Nehemiah came back to rebuild the walls. Ezra came back to reinstitute the Temple worship and Zerubbabel came back to rebuild the Temple.
 
As that time weans out, the Bible moves into a time of 400 years of silence. It doesn't mean that there wasn't anything happening; there was a lot happening in the world—it just means that during that time God doesn't really speak about much from Malachi to Matthew. He doesn't really tell us much about what is going on in the world. During that time there was the transition from the Medo Persian Empire to Alexander the Great and the Grecian Empire. The Grecian Empire upon the death of Alexander the Great was divided into 4 separate kingdoms and it was out of one of those kingdoms that Rome was invited to Israel by the Jewish people to come and free them from the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes, one of the Grecian rulers. So the Romans came and they were occupying the territory—the Romans were there!
 
Some 1400 to 1500 years after the death of Moses we have the stories of Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony and Cleopatra and Octavian among others. And it was out of this period of time that Rome was thrown into confusion. Upon the assassination of Julius Caesar the Nation of Rome was hit with a paralysis—with confusion; there was a lot of uncertainty about what was going to happen. And a little ways away from Rome at the other end of the Mediterranean in Judea a young man climbed into leadership. He was pretty much fully established by the age of 36; he was a ruthless fighter and because he was a ruthless fighter, he was known as an excellent warrior. He was a cunning negotiator; he was a subtle diplomat—he was an opportunist. In 25 B.C. Herod, who we would know as Herod the Great—not because he was a great man, but in the world's eyes, he did accomplish some great things. If you go to Israel today, there are still tons of remnants of Herod the Great. He was a ""master architect."" He built things to last and it is crazy stuff that he built that you can go there even today and see. And in 25 B.C. he began his architectural venture of the City of Caesarea by the Sea—a man-made port that you go today and you can walk around in that city and it's just fascinating to see the Amphitheater that he built there and all the things that he built—it's just astounding.  I mean the things we build now—we build Market Square Arena and 25 years later it is gone. You know these things he built and are still there—it's crazy. The aqueducts that he built to bring water to these cities that some of them would go 25, 30 and 40 miles; I mean they are mammoth, huge things; it is tremendous architecture. He built the City of Caesarea by the Sea because it was important for his Judea; it was important for his territory to have a place where ships could land because if ships could land, he could establish Israel as a place that was full-fledged, bought into Caesar worship because he would have people coming from Rome all of the time and he would become an extension of Rome and the worship of Caesar and the Roman gods but it collided with monotheistic Judaism because the Jews weren't of this system and it was a collision. It was a collision from the onset. It was a struggle as they constantly clashed over worship. Most of the clashes between the Jewish people and Herod the Great had to do with worship. They had to do with the spiritual thought of 'who is God and who will we give ourselves to.'
 
In 20 B.C. 5 years after embarking on the starting of the building of the City of Caesarea by the Sea, Herod started to build and work on the thing that we would know as the Herodian Temple, the Temple that was in existence during the days of Jesus. Herod was constantly doing things like this and the reason that he did it was because he wanted to try to endear himself to the Jewish people. He was a briber; he was constantly trying to think of ways that he could endear himself to them even though they had a deep seeded hatred toward him. When they would go through drought, he would import grain from Egypt in order to feed the people, not because he cared about the people so much, but because they were there and they existed and he wanted to win them to his side, but it didn't work. They were constantly in battle with each other. Herod the Great ruled with an iron fist. Herod the Great was crazy! I mean he was a bonafide nut ball. If you read the stories about him, he did some of the most absurd things. He killed his favorite wife because after he died he didn't want anybody else to have her so he killed her. He killed his sons; he killed his children. Actually, he was so hated within the Nation of Israel that he had ordered that upon his death that on that day all of the popular priests and rabbis throughout the land were to be executed and put to death because he knew that on his day of death would be a day of celebration in Israel and he could not stand that thought so he decided that if he killed the beloved sages, rabbis, and priests, they will mourn and then his day of death there would be mourning. This man was nuts! The Jewish people constantly battled against him.  One of the biggest reasons why I think they battled against him was because Herod by birth was an Idumean; that word—that name doesn't necessarily mean anything to us but when we break it down to what it is—all you have to do is go to your Bibles or to a Bible dictionary and it will tell you an Idumean is an Edomite and an Edomite is a descendant of Esau. The Jewish people were descendants of Jacob and Jacob and Esau had split. Esau had given away and sold his birthright; he had relinquished his position as the older son and now what the Jewish people see is a descendant of Esau who had given up his birthright coming in and usurping authority. So needless to say, Herod was not embraced by the people—he was crazy! The Jewish people there today—the tour guides—will talk about him as Herod the Craze; that's what they call him—Herod the Craze—he was a nut! He was so crazy that he would even order the killing of children—of baby boys under the ages of 2 in the City of Bethlehem in order to extinguish any chance that there might be one born a rightful King of the Jews. Herod ordered that those children be murdered, Satanically speaking, in the hopes—you know when you get out of the human part of it and go to the schemes of Satan where Satan is trying to destroy the Messiah. He's trying to destroy the one that is going to be sent to defeat him.
 
So it's in those thoughts that we turn to Luke 1. From now through the next 7 or 8 weeks or however long it is, we are going to be looking at Christmas Promises. We will start looking at them today. What are some of the things that God did through this event, through this birth, of His Son? We are going to start with a little bit of a different story, and it's all part of the story. When we talk about Christmas promises, we immediately think about Jesus but we're not really going to get to Jesus today because Luke starts in a little different place. (JR read Luke 1:1-4.) Now who is this guy writing Luke? Luke is the author of the book of Acts. Luke was there and he was around and he was aware of stuff and Luke felt like—have you ever thought about this?—that the importance of one man—what he does for you? Luke was thinking of you; he was thinking of me. He was in this world of Herod the Great; he was in this world of clashing and fighting and spiritual oppression and emotional and physical oppression and all the stuff that came along with it and in this Jesus shows up, risks His life, dies on a cross, was resurrected from the tomb, ascends to the Father, and Luke says 'I have been so exposed to this that I decided to get eyewitnesses and decided to study through this and I have carefully investigated everything from the beginning.' He says, 'So that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.' Everyone who reads this Gospel down the road—he investigated, he checked so that you might have certainty—certainty of the stories and what had happened. (JR then read Verse 5.) There in that verse we go back to the Torah—who were these people? They are both descendants of Aaron which means they are from the tribe of Levi. As descendants of Aaron, they are among the priestly family so Zechariah is there serving in the Temple as he is of the priesthood. (JR read Verse 6.) We learn that verse that it's not the ""hearers"" of the Word that are blessed; but the ""doers.""  How many people will fill churches of today all over the place and hear the Word but yet later today or tomorrow or the rest of this week will forget it and just live the way they want? Then next Sunday they will come punch in their God-time card again and we see the blessings here to Zechariah and to Elizabeth because they were 'blameless.' They observed and they followed God's commands. (JR read Verse 7.)  Pretty much any time in the Bible that you see those words that 'she couldn't conceive' or 'she was barren,' you need to let your ears perk up, because any time that God intervenes with humanity to give them a child that is out of the ordinary and we'll find later in this chapter that Miriam (Mary), though she is not barren, God intervenes in her life in a special way, too, and when God does that, He has a special purpose for that child. (JR read Verses 8-10.) So what the priest would do is when he served that day, he would Mikvah and would come in to the baptistery pools where outside they would wash and come in and at some point they would go through and cast lots on who was going to take care of the altar of incense. If you were in the Tabernacle last week—now the Tabernacle at ACC was a smaller version—what we're looking at here is the Temple and this is the Herodian Temple—the massive Temple, that Herod had built, and so everything is way over-sized from what we had last weekend but the positioning of things was still the same. And if you were in the Tabernacle last weekend you went in and on the right was the Table of Showbread and on the left was the Menorah and in front of you would see the curtain and behind the curtain is the Holy of Holies and right in front of the curtain was the altar of incense. Now for a priest, this was a huge blessing, to draw a lot to go in and to tend to the altar of incense because it was the closest that you could possibly get to the Holy of Holies in your service to God. It was just a place of honor! And in their minds it was one of those things of a desire to be close to God. Oh, I'm sure there was a little bit of nerves that went along with that but at the same time, it was a great honor. And so Zechariah is chosen to do this; he's going in within an arm's length of the Temple Veil. (JR read Verse 11.) I am not sure he was probably anticipating that when he walked in there. But all of a sudden Zechariah comes up and God is going to intervene in his life. God is going to intervene in his life and I can't touch on this enough. Why is God intervening in his life and as the story unfolds it is a positive intervention. It goes back to he and his wife being obedient to Torah—to God's instruction. Blessing follows obedience! We see it in our home lives; we've talked about it in here often. Children that are living in a period of blessing have been obedient; children that are under the persecution of time-out haven't been.  Parents, when you have a child that you can trust, it's a lot easier to give your blessing when you know they are walking in righteousness—when they are doing the right things.          It's easier to extend your blessing. The Scriptures talk over and over about this kind of thing—the whole idea of walking in righteousness. Now, don't misunderstand this. It doesn't mean that if you walk in righteousness, that you are a God chaser and totally devoted to Him, to live out His instructions for your life—it doesn't mean that you're not going to have any problems. It doesn't mean that there is not going to be disease in your family at some point. What it means is that the blessing of God is in your life.
 
I ask people all the time when we go through pre-marital counseling, often I'll ask them the question, ""Do you want a good marriage or do you want a blessed marriage?""  Most of the time they just look at me, not really sure how to answer that. The truth is there is a really big difference. There is a big difference between a good marriage and a blessed marriage. Everybody wants a good marriage. I've never had one couple, when I've asked that question, say 'You know, we've talked about it and we really don't want a good marriage. You know, we would really like to struggle and fight and not get along; that's what we're hoping for.' That's not what people say! Everybody wants a good marriage, but not everyone wants a blessed marriage. A blessed marriage is the next level; a blessed marriage is two people individually who are committed to God who are chasing God. I always put the diagram in the form of a triangle. The guy and the girl are at the bottom points of the triangle and I put God at the top. In a blessed marriage individually as we are chasing God, what happens to us? (JR showed with his hand and fingers the two individuals going up towards the top point of the triangle.) If they don't, what happens to us? (His fingers then went down.) It's a very visual thing and it's very true and without exception, every single relationship (in 30 years of ministry) and not just marriage relationships, but every single relationship issue I've ever had to deal with has to do with that—every single one—without exception. When people are being drawn to God, they don't come see me; they just don't.       The reason they do is because one or the other or both are running a different direction and they get further and further and further apart and relationally they begin to break down.
 
Zechariah had intervention from God because he pursued God and his wife was in the same situation. She was a God-pursuer. (JR read Verses 11-13.) Now it says that they were along in years. If they were both along in years, do you think this was his prayer that morning? I was thinking about that this week. He probably wasn't praying that this morning. These are prayers of the past that God has heard and has tucked away to give the answer in the right time. I doubt that he was praying that this morning and if he was and she heard him, she might have punched him. 'No, not now; we're past that and beyond that.' But Gabriel says that the prayers are to be answered and heard. (JR read Verses 14-15.) He was a Nazarite! God had given him a Nazarite vow from the womb—this goes back to the Torah. These things were all rooted in the Torah. God is telling him—the angel is telling him—that he is to be a Nazarite from the very beginning which means he is never to touch any kind of fermented drink—you know he might be the only guy in history that never had a haircut—ever, because under a Nazarite vow, he couldn't do that and he was declared Nazarite from birth so by the time he offers his head up on a platter, he might not have been a guy that some of us would invite into our homes because he was a little unruly looking, which is kind of ridiculous that we're so shallow that we base everything on the visual. But some of these Bible people; I don't say ""characters"" because that, to me, that term is ""fictional."" These Bible people don't fit the mold of walking into our churches a lot of times as far as the visual appeal. As he grows up John would have been thought about in society as a rebel—some would say 'hell on wheels,'—he's lost his mind; he fights against authority but the truth for John the Baptist was that he lived by a higher authority and he was dedicated to a higher authority. (JR read Verses 16-17.) What an enormous task! God has singled out this individual to be the forerunner to the Messiah. He is the one who is to walk through the hills of Judea, in the Judean wilderness crying out REPENT FOR THE KINGDOM OF GOD IS NEAR. He is the herald of God; he is the one that is blowing the trumpet telling the people that the Messiah that you've been waiting for 1400 years, from the day that Moses stood on the plains of Moab and gave the book of Deuteronomy as he encouraged the people before they go into the land, John the Baptist went right back to that place on the riverside and said REPENT, THE TIME HAS COME! We've waited for what seems like forever—1400 or 1500 years seems like forever, but God says that 'a day is like 1,000 years and 1,000 years is like a day' so at most, it's been a day and a half. God is not caught up in time the way we are. And here is this one that is going to be born of Zechariah and Elizabeth, who is going to be the herald of the king. (JR read Verse 18.) There and again I doubt this was his prayer that morning. But you have to be careful what you ask for. (JR read Verses 19-20.) He asked for a sign; Gabriel gives him a sign. Your wife sees this sign as a blessing. 'You shall be silent until the time the birth comes about.' (JR read Verses 21-24.) I'm thinking she is embarrassed because she is older—I don't know if that's the reason why. I had a friend actually, a few years ago, who told me she was pregnant and I said, 'Oh, that's awesome' to which she responded 'No, no it's not; it's really not; I already have 3 and this one—no.' I remember with her that was the visual I had this week.
 
(JR read Verse 25.) The Christmas promises begin with the story of John the Baptist. The promises of Christmas—the promises of deliverance—the promise of what God wants to do in the world—what God has committed to do in this story and let me show how clearly they begin in this story. The name Zechariah, which is the name of my son, (he's Zachary, but same name) means ""God has remembered."" God has remembered! The name Elizabeth means ""the oath of God."" The two people of this story—Zechariah and Elizabeth—their names when you put them together, means ""God has remembered the oath of God."" God has remembered the promise of God. God has remembered his commitment that He made to the world, and this is where the Christmas story starts. We know ultimately the Christmas story is fulfilled in the birth of John's cousin—Yeshua--Jesus of Nazareth, but those are promises we are going to get to in the weeks to come and I will tell you this. I encourage you with this: God gives promises and He remembers. God hears prayers and He remembers. You may have prayed for something for 10 years and haven't addressed the subject for the last 5 because it is kind of 'out of sight; out of mind,' and you left that time frame in your life, but God hears and I believe this with a passion because I've experienced it in my life, but God wants to fulfill His promises through Jesus, even in my life and in your life. That's His desire. But in order for that to come into total fruition, it takes you and me submitting and surrendering ourselves to that Yeshua—to that Jesus—to lay down the rebel arms—all the arms we've taken up—all the guns and knives we use to fight against God—it takes us laying those down.
 
I'll be honest with you. This week is kind of going to be a weird week. I'm telling y'all, if you didn't realize what I was saying when I started this, we are living in America in the days of Herod the Great. We just are. Politicians are not the solution for us. They just aren't! They are all fallible. And our country has gotten to a place where power is so important we will steal, kill, lie and do whatever it takes—whatever it takes—to remain in power. And it's a sad state! It's a sad state we're in. And I do think you should vote Tuesday, but way beyond voting, I think you should pray because your prayers will have a much greater impact on this country than your vote. They just will! Remember when I said sometimes couples don't commit to having a blessed marriage? Even though intellectually they may know they are believers, but they don't commit to pursue God for whatever reason. That's where America is—that's where the church is. We have got to commit to pursue God; we don't need to commit to pursue a political purpose. We need to commit to pursue the King of Kings—the Lord of Lords and pray His intervention in our lives and no matter who gets elected or whatever office in whatever state in whatever place this week, it doesn't matter to me, because God is in control. Let's pray.
 
 
Closing Prayer – God, we pray for the forgiveness of our country. We are living in perilous times; we are living in a time where we have gone places in America that we've never gone before as to what we would do to retain power. Lord, it's a sad state and it's a sad time—personally, for me, Lord, as I have no idea-— don't want to vote for anybody. I mean I want to vote because I feel like it's my responsibility as an American. Lord, I'd like to vote for you. Lord, I pray that you will teach us as a Nation and that you will convict us and I pray that we will have confidence that your will will be done and if we need to be brought low in order to be brought back to you, then so be it. Lord, I pray for revival and I pray that revival starts here in this room—in our churches—here, not us pointing at the TV and blaming other people but God, that it would start right here. Lord, may we trust you; may we turn to Jesus; may be accept Him as Savior and Lord, if there is anyone in here today who needs to accept Him as Savior, Lord, I pray that today would be a day of salvation. In the Name of Jesus, Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",11/6/2016,
"Today concludes the last of a year-long sermon series. I remember once it took JR a year to get through the book of John in a Bible study, so we have improved by going through 5 books in a year. Who knows what will occur in the coming year. What a great study; what a great opportunity and if you missed any of those, one more final announcement is just this week we were able to get all of our sermons on ITunes, so if you are an ITunes user or a podcast person, you can go to ITunes and search for Arcadia Christian Church and you will find every sermon of this past year's series there and you will be able to download those and look back on all the messages.
 
It's no coincidence that it is Tabernacle season; it is no coincidence that this Judaic Torah one-year reading cycle that pre-dates Jesus—there is no coincidence that it ends and begins at the Tabernacle season and we are getting ready to celebrate that here with this congregation next week. Sukkot is a holiday which is all about celebrating two things: it is about the fact that we celebrate God's dwelling with us and it's about the fact that we celebrate God's protecting us in the wilderness. So in Judaism for 7 days the tradition was to go out of your house, build a tent, and stay out in your tent; in 2017 it's RV's and 5th wheels but the idea was to go out into the tent and dwell, thus getting out of your house where you were safe and secure in order to deal with the elements, because what you're doing is you're replicating the time when the Israelites were in the wilderness where they didn't have fortified walls and big cities or great armies—they were vulnerable; they roamed for 40 years in the wilderness and all they had was God and He provided them food and He provided light and He provided water; there was a cloud by day and fire by night. His presence was enough and so Tabernacles is a time to reflect and rely on the fact that God is enough and that He is our Provider and that God dwells with us and really in the final Torah portion here—in the final section—if you have your Bibles, turn to Deuteronomy 33 and 34, that's exactly what Moses is going to end with his people.
 
In Deuteronomy 33 Moses is going to bless them—it's all about the blessings and we are going to break it into two sections where Chapter 33 is the blessing where Moses is literally going to stand at the foot of the mountain and the Nation of Israel is going to congregate there and Moses is going to spell out blessings to the entire nation and then he's going to bless each individual tribe, 12 tribes minus one—there is one that's left out so that's something you can go study on your own and maybe dig a little bit about. So here Moses is going to bless them and we're not going to look much at the blessings for the individual tribes; we'll skip that for one simple reason—we don't have time. It's great study—it's deep—it is prophetic; but he goes through each tribe and he prays and he blesses each group in their uniqueness but what we are going to look at in the blessings is what he says to them as a whole because I believe and I believe Scripture is clear that we are also heirs to those same promises and those same blessings.
 
The 2nd section, Deuteronomy 34, Moses climbs the mountain and he dies and that's significant because they are congregated within just a few miles of the Promised Land of which they are about to go enter and take. They are about to go redeem; they are about to move back home but Moses isn't going to go—he isn't going to get to go. But in spite of that, what we're going to talk about in Chapter 34 is how Moses finishes strong. He is a strong finisher! And it's amazing to me considering what we've studied in the past few weeks and what Moses has gone through, including his fears and his failures that he is able to finish strong.
 
Let's look at Chapter 33. This is what it says in Verse 1. (Matt read it.) I want to stop there because this is the first time in all the Bible—it's the first time in the Torah that ""the man of God"" is ever pronounced on anyone—not Abraham—not Noah—not Isaac—not Jacob--not Joseph, no one has been called a man of God. And everything I found pointed to the fact that what the literal Hebrew there is that he is a man who truly knew God. What an awesome statement in his final moments. This man of God is about to pronounce on the Israelites, before his death, blessings. (Matt read Verses 2-5.) And he jumps right into the blessings of the tribes. Now, what I want to take from this here is a couple of things. First of all, he opens up with reminding them that God came to be with them. He refers back to the past when God showed up on Mt. Sinai, when they heard God's voice and when it first started roaring—now they saw signs of Him in the exodus out of Egypt, I mean parting the Red Sea is a pretty big sign, but there was a moment on Mt. Sinai when God spoke and they heard His Voice. You know I had a professor in college once that said, ''Imagine God talking to people? We're sinners; we mess up—we're feeble minded and we argue with the TV over a Colts game, and the Almighty God is trying to reason with us and He's trying to talk to us and explain to us who He is and where He is in our lives."" So this professor said, ""God trying to talk to us and teach us is probably like us getting in a time machine and going back to the Stone Age time and trying to explain to a Stone Age person how a lightbulb works.""  I mean, can you imagine that for a minute? We would go back in time and try to explain, so what would you do? Well, you would look at the surroundings and you would probably say, 'Okay, well, there are some vines, so imagine these vines going from tree to tree and they dive into your cave and there is power going through them—okay, look at the sun and you see that sun up there in the sky and try to get some of that power into your cave'—hey, if you can do better than that, I've been trying all week and can't figure it out, but in reality here is this perfect God looking down on people who keep messing up—messing up, and He's trying to convey—it's magical how He is able to speak in Matt Wallace terms to where I can understand. But that's exactly what He's going to do here and that is exactly what Moses is reminding the people about—God came down and He spoke to you, and 'in spite of your failures, and in spite of the fact that we are an uneducated group of slaves, God is with us and He spoke to us' and He brought His Holy Ones with Him.  And then he begins to bless!
 
Now before we get back into these blessings, there are 3 blessings I want to look at. Before we do, I want you to skip down to Verse 29. Verse 29 is an important verse, so we're going to skip the blessings and go back and forth. In this verse—this is an important verse to wrestle with as we think of these blessings. (Matt read Verse 29a.) If there's one thing we've learned in Torah, it is that Israel is different—the people of Israel are different. ""Who is like you, oh Israel, a people saved by the Lord?"" What an awesome statement. Who is like them? What does that mean? Who is Israel? And Moses has gotten them to the foot of the mountain and they are congregated there and he is reminding them that 'there is no one like you on this earth as God has chosen you—think about what He has delivered you from. You are saved—not being saved—not hoping to be saved—you're blessed—you're saved.'
 
You know, we also, as we look at these blessings have the ability to tie in—what does that mean? One of my favorite verses in Torah is in Deuteronomy 4:5 and I'm just going to read this and I want you to listen. (Matt read Verses 5-7.) You see, the idea of the Israeli nation was to be the light of the world so that when people would see Israel, they would see them connected to their God in a way to be connected to the blessings of God that they would live in such a way with these teachings that all the people—all the neighboring communities would look at them and say 'Wow, who is like them? They are different and the God they actually talk to responds.' And why does He respond? Because they are connected—because He is real.  You know the question in our culture today is do people look at us that way? Can people look at the church? Is the church in America or in the world so focused on blending in and connecting and making sure we are so a part of the culture today that we're losing the identity of 'Wow, they're different—there is just something about those people?'  'Who is like you, oh Israel, saved by the Lord?' You know Jesus said similar things in the Upper Room. In the Upper Room after 3 years—it wasn't 4 years, but it was 3 years with God, and He is about to leave them. They are in that Upper Room and He's blessing them and praying over them and He has washed their feet and is celebrating Passover with them, and He says to them, 'I'm about to leave and where I'm going you can't go but I'm not truly leaving you because I'm going to send my Spirit to dwell in you to empower you, to teach you,' so that's God being able to communicate with His people and He says this in John 17:3. (Matt read it.) You see the whole gist of this—the whole gist of Torah and the whole gist of these blessings is this: God is with you.
 
Let's look back at Deuteronomy 33:3. Here are 2 blessings that are pretty dominant. (Matt read Verse 3.) God loves you and you are in His Hand. You see that's God being able to speak in terms that I can understand. I can picture that; I can picture parents for the first time picking up their newborn baby and holding it and cradling it in their hands. I can picture a mom or dad clutching their kids' hands walking through a crowd. I can picture a grandparent picking up a grandbaby and holding it in their hands, and God says here through Moses 'It is you I love.' What does it mean to be saved? To be saved means to be in the Hands of God.  Isn't that a cool picture? You're in the Hands of God. Look what else it says. (Matt read Verse 4.) You know, one of the things I often struggle with and I know many have is 'How do you hear the Voice of God?' Do you ever struggle with that? Is God speaking to me?
A few weeks ago, the staff went over to Dayton, OH and we went to Stony Brook Christian Church. That night before church we met with the pastor and we had dinner. He was talking about his sermon the next morning was going to be on that—hearing the call of God. That has always been something in my mind that I've wrestled with. He said, 'As I've been going through this, there is this couple who has been kind of struggling with whether or not to go into the mission field, and they are wrestling with Africa and just not sure if God wants them to go there or not,' and he said, 'these are normal people, by the way—good people,' and he said that 'after it had rained and they walked out to get into their car, and there in their driveway was a huge water mark in the perfect form of Africa.' Well, I'm sitting there and I'm thinking 'Oh, here we go,' because in my mind what I was thinking was—well on one hand, I was thinking, right! But on the other hand, I'm kind of ticked because I've always wanted the African moment—God, give me Africa in the driveway and then I'll know you want me to go, right?' Now, I was pleased to hear the pastor at the table say, 'Man, I am freaked; I never had an African moment and don't know what that means,' and he shared that again on Sunday morning. We wrestle with hearing God's Voice but let's go back to this blessing. (Matt repeated reading Verse 3.)  You see the challenges we have? I know it's a challenge that I have with hearing God's Voice because before you receive the instruction, what do you have to do? You have to bow! You have to get at His feet. Because what we want is we want God's Voice to coincide with what our mind has already set out that we think is the way things should go—right? I want this job; I want this life—I'm supposed to be a MLB pitcher, and I need God's Voice to tell me that. But whatever the situation is, we want God's Voice to coincide with the things that it's heard and what Moses says is 'Remember, you're in His Hand, but to hear His Voice you have to humble yourself and you have to bow and put Him in the proper place.' And just maybe some of us who struggle and feel like we've never heard God's Voice, saying 'Oh, I've read the Bible and I've heard sermons; I've been to church my whole life,' but maybe, just maybe, what we haven't actually done is that we haven't actually ever truly bowed in submission and allowed God's Word to be heard because He has spoken to us—it's right here! And they are His words; 'at His feet, He gives us instruction.'
 
Do you remember the story in the New Testament about Mary and Martha? Martha was roaming around the kitchen and she was working and serving the disciples and busy ministering to them—she's like a good children's ministry worker here at church, just running around keeping kids in the room and meanwhile Mary is at the foot of Jesus on the couch, pouring some perfume on His Feet, listening to His stories. And Martha is ticked. 'What are you doing in there? We have work to do; there is ministry to be done; you needn't be bothering Him—we have people to serve,' and Jesus recognized the situation and as the story goes, Mary was right where she needed to be. Sometimes we need to get down at the feet of Jesus—at the feet of God—and say 'Speak to me,' and then open up His Word, His Torah, His instruction.
 
Moses began to bless all the tribes and he comes back again at the end of the chapter and he re-blesses them again as an entire nation—a Nation that is in His Hand—they are to be at His Feet and in Verse 27, maybe the coolest one of all, it says (Matt read Verse 27a.) Again, these are words that I can understand in a visual that I can see. You see, Moses probably needed to hear that one as much as anybody because there are going to be moments in life and in the journey—remember the context as the Israelites are about to enter the Promised Land and take it and even though you are on the brink of your home, there will be moments when you need to take refuge and your God will provide that refuge. Remember, He dwells with you. 'Don't be afraid because underneath are His everlasting arms.' Why are His everlasting arms underneath you? Because you will trip and you will fall.
 
One commentary that I read of a Jewish rabbi said, 'This is all about the decent of a mountain experience.' We all have those mountain top experiences where things are good; people are listening—my kids are actually listening to me. My job is going well; my projects are successful; I'm being promoted—things are good and I seem to have some realm of influence—I'm involved in ministry and things are really, really, good, but then there are those moments, when all of a sudden, it doesn't seem like anyone is listening to me. It seems like everything I touch breaks; my relationships seem to be crumbling. There could be a lot of circumstances that are failing. I'm not on the mountain peak anymore; it's those times when I have to recognize that underneath me are those everlasting arms.
 
""Israel, you are blessed; who is like you?"" What does it mean to know God? What does it mean to be blessed? It means to know that you are in His Hands. It means to know that at His Feet you will find His Voice and it means that when you fail, His everlasting arms are there to catch you. Those blessings to that nation at that time rang true to them and they ring true to us—that through Jesus, we are adopted heirs and we are adopted into the promises and the blessings and it's because of those blessings I believe that Moses in Chapter 34, even in spite of not being able to go into the Promised Land, is able to remain strong. You know when you have those blessings and you can lean on them, you are able to finish strong and that's exactly what Moses did.
 
Look at Chapter 34:1. (Matt read Verses 1-3.) This is a very special piece of property, and Moses gets to see it. He is on the brink of it down just north of Edom on the plains of Moab and is on top of this mountain and he's seeing it and God said to him in Verse 4 (Matt read it.)  What a blow! He got to see it; he's up there and he's looking and for over 40 years this has been the journey—for over 40 years of blood, sweat and tears in the desert and now he gets to see it but doesn't get to go in. I think it's important to note that even in that situation, he finished strong, and in Verse 5 it says this (Matt read it.) Notice who buried him—it says the Lord buried him. (Matt continued -reading Verses 6-7.) Moses finished well! Moses finished strong—physically and spiritually! His finishing strong is a big deal.
 
Finishing strong is a big deal—if you are tied to athletics at all, you know this. In junior high I was awful at finishing strong. I ran cross country, and thank goodness, this was probably the problem. When I would line up at the start line for about the first quarter of the race people could see you. So when that guy shot that starting gun, I was among the leaders; I was out in front, man; I was running, and I'll never forget it—I hit that woods and me and my buddy who was out in front; we would look at each other and it was always a question to see who would be the first one to say it—'Are you ready to walk now?' And then we'd walk—it was a speed walk—kind a. And I can still hear my mom—she probably doesn't remember this—say, 'Hey, when you went into that woods, you were first, but you came out of the woods and you were kind of in the back.' Finishing strong can be hard. Middle schoolers are exceptionally good at not finishing strong; when I was a teacher, it was amazing. Middle schoolers—especially boys, they would do their homework and do it perfectly and it was done, it was there and in the folder, but you know what they often wouldn't do?—they often wouldn't turn it in. It's a zero in the gradebook and I heard, 'Well, I did it.' 'You got to finish strong; you got to turn the assignment in.' It's not just middle schoolers; that's why they call it ""senioritis."" Ask any senior how hard it is to finish strong, and those of you who remember that year, it's a tough one, and after having been in education for many, many years now, I've seen countless kids go 11 ½ to 11 ¾ with greatness, but something happens in that senior year that just makes it tough to finish. I've seen kids, oh you know, they just kind of do what I did in the woods—they kind of walk and limp to the finish line, but there are others that things go really well but all of a sudden off the charts they go off in another direction. And not only do they not finish well, but they barely finish and they are heading in another direction.
 
You know what God is looking for is the person like a marathon runner when they hit the wall in that last quarter of the race—they say the really good ones that are really strong and are champions are the ones that when their bodies tell them to quit, but their body is able to keep pushing on, they know the voice in their head that says 'quit' is a lie and that it's not true. 'My body can keep going' so they keep running; it's that player in the 4th quarter that can finish and his opponent can't; it's that guy in the 9th inning; it's the person at the end of the season or at the end of his career and whether it's a relationship or an athletic event or school or whatever, we need to finish strong. The problem is we often don't, because of fear—because of doubt—because of the voices that we often hear louder than the Voice of God. We move away from the Feet of God and we are influenced by the voices of the world that tell us all kinds of things—that tell us that we're not good enough—that tell us that we are failures, that we keep messing up, that tell us that our circumstances are too hard and that there aren't enough people around to go through it with us so we struggle to finish. I don't know what your situation is at this moment in time, but regardless of what it is, God wants us to be strong finishers. Moses was a strong finisher; now I mean I'm sure he faced these same struggles, right? Moses was a murderer and then He was a fugitive and then He went out and herded His sheep on the side of a mountain for several years—imagine those nights—lonely nights with just him and his sheep. What was going through his mind? I'll bet he never dreamed he would ever finish strong. And even though he had his God-experience and saw God in ways that no one else has ever seen Him, it was still a rocky road—no pun intended—as he struck the rock, God said 'You're not going in. You're not going into the Promised Land.' Moses pressed on; he finished well; he prayed and he blessed his nation and he stood at the top of that mountain and he looked over and saw the people on one side and the land on the other and here is what I want you to hear. While his failures did impact where he finished, they certainly didn't impact how. And on this side of Heaven, more times than not, we probably won't finish where we'd hoped. When you think of all your hopes and dreams on this earth, it is true that our circumstances are that we live in a sinful world but it doesn't mean that in the midst of our circumstances that have been created for us or that we've created that we can't still finish well and I challenge you this week—today—to read Hebrews 11. That chapter is just a laundry list of people who finished well. It starts in the beginning and it just goes through the Bible—especially the Old Testament people who just finished well. Listen to what it says about Abraham, Moses, Joseph, all the prophets—it says this about them in Hebrews 11:13-16. (Matt read the passage.) You can read in this chapter these people on earth by our standards didn't finish well; some of them were persecuted, martyred, but they did by faith in front of each incident of these people's lives—it said, 'by faith, Abraham; by faith Moses,--what did they have faith in? They had faith in the fact that their God was in their midst and that their God had them by His Hand; they had faith in the voice they heard when they bowed at His Feet; they had faith that when they would fall and struggle that the Everlasting Arms were stretched out underneath to catch them and to prop them back up. By faith they were able to journey to the end and so is Moses, to be able to say the very words the Apostle Paul said at the end of his life. ""I have fought the good fight; I have kept the faith; I have finished the race. Now there is in store for me a crown."" You see the big picture here?—the big picture in this? It is that God is in our midst—He is in our midst and He wants us not to quit. He has blessed you and He wants you not to quit—to keep running—to keep moving forward—to keep charging ahead—to keep being a dad—to keep being a husband—to keep being a friend—to keep searching His Voice—to keep reaching out, no matter what happens because you are in His Hands and His arms are underneath you. 
 
I want to end with this. It's a fascinating prophecy. Moses died on Mount Nebo which is in the southeast of the land of Edom. Moses did not go in. Days and weeks later Joshua is going to take charge and lead them into the land—read the next book. Moses is gone and Joshua takes charge. Moses wasn't able to take them to the final destination, but Isaiah, years after Moses, but Isaiah 63, years after Moses, but years before Jesus prophesied this and I want you to hear these words. (Matt read Isaiah 63:1.) Who are you, oh Israel, a people saved by God. That's the big question. Saved? Because while Moses stopped on Mt. Nebo, there will come a day when Jesus will go right through it and He's going to declare victory and the questions that we have are ""Are you in His Hands? Do you feel that grip? Do you hear His Voice? Do you trust those Everlasting Arms?"" If you are struggling with those things and if you are looking to say for the first time, 'I want to be saved; I want to be in those Hands; I want to bow at His feet and I want to be washed in baptism,' we're going to give you that opportunity today. I will pray and I pray you will respond and you will find Him at His Feet and that you will find His Voice and trust His Arms. Let's pray.
 
 
 
 
 
Closing Prayer – God, I thank you for your Hands; I thank you for your Voice. Forgive us when we try to interpret that Voice without first coming to you in reverence. I thank you for your Everlasting Arms that are always there. Help us to trust as we journey and at all the different points of the journey, we all have different struggles and we all have different fears. I pray that as we close this study of the Torah that we would proclaim the blessings of Israel—that we would hold to them because as we do we will finish strong. In Jesus' Name, we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",10/23/2016,
"Werner and Hannelie Groenewald—he was pastoring a church in 2002 in South Africa and he had been doing that for several years. They were living very comfortably; she was serving as a doctor in a trauma unit—life for them was really good. They felt like they were serving God and doing what He wanted them to do. In 2002, Werner took a trip from where they lived in South Africa to Afghanistan to serve for a couple of weeks on a mission. He came back and started to talk to his wife about how awesome this was and later in that same year (2002) the two of them packed up and took off for a 2 or 3 week mission trip to Pakistan and also to Afghanistan. Now, if you remember this was in 2003, right in the aftermath of 9/11 and how crazy things were in that part of the world—not that they're not crazy now, but it was a new craziness—at least for us in our involvement there. By April of 2003, which was just a handful of months later, they had begun the process of moving to Kabul. They moved with their two children, Jean Pierre, who at the time was a 5-year old boy, and their daughter, Rode, who was 3. Now if you can even begin to wrap your mind around that—I was sitting and reading this story and I cannot even fathom what would be going through my mind as I am in Pakistan and Afghanistan and feeling the probing in my heart that God is calling me to move my—not just to move me—but to move my family including my 5 year old boy and my 3-year old daughter into a place that was so so struggling, to say the least. In the story that I read Hannelie said that ""My spiritual journey really started in Afghanistan. It was in Afghanistan that God really began to grip my life,"" and to that point she had been a secular version of a Christian, a nominal Christian at best; she had attended church regularly—obviously her husband was a pastor and he probably frowned upon it if she didn't attend. She had attended church and lived as a Christian but that pretty much ended there. She didn't feel like God had ever really gripped her life and that she had ever really surrendered her daily living to Jesus. Life in Afghanistan was hard; it was extremely difficult, especially when you have children. The first thing she struggled with was education—it was important and it wasn't as if it was the end of their education and you kind of finish things up; it was at the very beginning of the process with a 5 and a 3-year old, so she began the process of the whole homeschool thing because of the language barriers and all the things that were met with that. Life was hard because of a lack of friends and a lack of relationships. Life was extremely hard for little Rode to know that she is going to grow up in a place where women are basically locked away and where they don't have the freedom to come out and do things. Over the next few years it was hard but she talked about how God had really met them where they lived. Even though they thought they would live forever together in South Africa, when they got to Afghanistan she found that Jesus had already been there. He had already been there and He had prepared a life for them; He had prepared a place for them.
 
Our Torah portion today is Deuteronomy 31:1-30. We are down to the final 3 weeks of the Torah; it is hard for me to believe that we've spent an entire year walking through this. I have to testify to you that it has been the greatest year of my life as far as learning and I was sitting and reflecting this past weekend with a friend over in Dayton when we were on our staff getaway; it was a preacher friend of mine and he was asking me having taught through this and he asked ""What have you found that you've learned?"" and I answered ""New Testament."" That's the thing that has been most surprising to me is how much I have really learned about the New Testament and what God was talking to us about and living out God's Torah—God's instruction in life. So here we get to Deuteronomy 31; it is Vayelech and it is different from most of the other portions because it is simply one chapter. Vayelech means 'And He Went' and it is found in this first sentence and I'm going to read the first 8 verses for us today. (JR read Deuteronomy 31:1-8.) Over and over and over in these first 8 verses we find that Moses gives—the rabbis believe that this is the beginning of a new day and it's the last day of Moses' earthly life. And the events of the next 2 or 3 chapters are the last day that Moses lived on earth.  It begins with this process of Moses realizing that he is 120 and he is not crossing the Jordan and that his time has come. The time has come for him to pass the baton of leadership to the next man up, to the next one in line, to the next one appointed to be a leader of this family of these tribes of people. Over and over in these first 8 verses he says those same words that he gave direction to Phinehas to speak: ""Do not be afraid; take courage."" I speak of Phinehas because he was the one several weeks ago when I spoke on that and I shared a story about one of our middle school boys a few weeks later who after hearing the story of Phinehas of how Moses had told him to go with the 120,000 soldiers to battle and he was to go as the priest of the army and as he walked with that army, his role was to tell the people, to tell the soldiers to 'not be afraid; to take courage; do not fear; do not panic'—the role of Phinehas in that moment was to keep the Israeli soldiers focused on God and not the enemy—focused on God—focused on the sender, and not the enemy. And how often do we get distracted in life—how often we get involved in the daily struggle—the daily turmoil—the daily battle—the daily grind to just get through another day and the temptation to come to focus on the problems, rather than on the problem-solver. And it may not be that God will solve all our problems because 'In this world you will have struggle,' but He told us 'I have overcome the world.' He will be the problem-solver—it just may not always be here. He may not always take away our struggles here. The Apostle Paul prayed over and over and over that God would take away the thorn from his flesh; he doesn't specify what that is but there was a struggle he had in life and he prayed over and over for God to take that away and God responded with what?—""My grace is sufficient for you."" 'Rest in Me; my grace is sufficient for you.' Now that's not the answer we like. You know in fast-food America we like our things solved now. We want it solved at the drive-thru—when we pull up through the drive-thru, we want our hunger solved and don't even want to pull up to the next window to wait because they're still cooking it. We want them to know ahead of time what I want and be cooking and preparing it so that it will be ready and still here's the thing; if they give it to us and it's not hot, then we're mad. Right? So we want them to be mind readers and solve all of our problems but that's not necessarily the way God operates. God is the problem solver but He may not solve all of our problems here because He tells us in James 1 that our struggles help us develop perseverance and perseverance gives us maturity that we need to walk through life. If everything is easy we don't mature the same way. My basketball players get mad when I make them run at the end of practice for conditioning. I remind them 'You've got other friends; I'm not here to be your friend; I'm here to make you better.' Sometimes to get better, it hurts. Sometimes to get better, it's a struggle. Sometimes to get better you have to figure out how to put one foot in front of the other and just keep on going.
 
Yesterday our HH Girls' Soccer team, of which my daughter Shanna is a member, lost in the sectional finals. She said something right along with that same thing to me last night. I don't think she realized that was what she was saying, but she was talking about how painful it is because there were seniors that just played their last game—a team that will never be together that way to play again because next year's team will be different because the seniors will be gone and new ones coming in or maybe somebody moves away or transfers to so it will just be different. And the pain after the game when you've been around the season just got to her and she was hurting and Shanna told me afterwards when we were going to eat last night—just the two of us—she said, ""I feel like I'm going to get sick."" She had the feeling of that and said, ""We worked so hard; all that work—all that work,"" but you know what?—everybody doesn't win. It really wouldn't be that much fun to compete if everyone won. It stinks when you work that hard and lose but you get better from it. And as she and I sat at Taco Bell, the store of ""revelation"" I said to her ""You just have to remember this feeling—as an athlete, you just have to remember this feeling and you have to figure out how to not let it happen again."" That's the goal; the goal is to win. And it's the same way in life; God doesn't take away all of our pain. God doesn't remove all of our struggle and as we proceed through this passage here, Moses is telling Joshua—he's doing the same thing he told Phinehas to do but now he is telling Joshua who is the new leader of the new group that is marching in and he's telling them 'Take courage and focus on the right things.' Focus on the right things and if you're an athlete and in training you just focus on the pain and the running in the moment, you're probably not going to get too far; in those moments you have to focus on the reasons why you're doing this; you have to focus on the goal ahead. You have to give it some value and Moses is telling him, 'Look, focus on the right things.'  Friends, as you struggle through life, and we all go through those days of struggle—you might be in a time of shalom right now—it may be a time of peace; maybe you're in the struggle but wherever we are we know those struggles are going to come because it is life—it is life in a fallen world and our focus is so critical as to how we journey.
 
The author of Hebrews says 'Fix your gaze upon Jesus, the author and perfector of our faith'—to fix our eyes upon Him and to continue to know and understand that every struggle that we go through, we can let it destroy us or it can be a refining and a defining moment for maturity. In Verse 3 this kind of leapt off the page at me and it's the direction I want to take for a couple of minutes this morning. (He re-read Verse 3.) 'Both the Lord and Joshua will cross over ahead of you.' The Hebrew name for Joshua is Yehoshua; in the Greek or another type of the Hebrew version of it, it is Yeshua, so Jesus and Joshua are the same name. Heather and I were talking the other day about the Torah, etc., and she asked 'How are you thinking and feeling about this study?' I replied, 'Honestly I feel kind of weird because I feel like I should keep going into Joshua when we finish Deuteronomy because I feel like I'm leaving the story. I mean here we have spent a whole year with this people talking about the Promised Land and we get right to the edge of the Promised Land and we're going to stop. I mean, right before you win—we're going to stop! I said that there is something about it that we should just keep going into Joshua and she said 'I have been thinking the exact same thing.' She said how hard it would be to stop at this point. You know the picture of the book of Joshua is a picture of Yeshua. It's a picture of Jesus! It's a picture of victory. Just like we saw in the life of Joseph in the book of Genesis and how clearly his life mirrors the life of Jesus that would come later and as we've seen in the life of Moses how clearly the life of Moses as the First Redeemer mirrors the life of the Second Redeemer that would come later, known to us as Jesus. The book of Joshua is that of the conqueror; he is that of the one in conquest and Moses is telling Joshua here that 'as you go understand to take courage,' and then he tells the people that Yeshua—Yehoshua—that Joshua will go, that he will lead you and cross over in front of you.
 
I am going to read 3 passages out of the New Testament today, first starting in John 4:1-5. (He read it and then he read Verse 14.) Here the Apostle John is talking about Jesus. As he starts peeling back the layers and saying you know we think about this God that is in the Heavens; we think about this God who is very mystical to us that we can't really understand; we think about this God whose ways are not our ways; He is perfect and we're far from perfect. It's this God that we can't really grasp but John in John 1 says 'Let me tell you about this God; the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word became flesh and He dwelt—He tabernacled—He lived with us.'  In 1 John 1:1-4 John, the same writer, says this: (He read it.) He says 'We have heard it; we have seen it with our eyes; our hands have touched it.' John says this God who seems so mystical and seems so far away and so distant, but John the Apostle says 'Not anymore.' Emmanuel—God among us; Jesus has come in the flesh. John says 'our eyes have seen Him; our hands have touched Him—these things you can count as fact.' He is an eyewitness testimony; he walked with Him; he talked with Him, along life's narrow way. He spent life with Jesus; he spent life with the Son of God. He spent life with God in the flesh—Emmanuel!  John says that if you want to know how much we as disciples, as the apostles, believe this, he could have very well said 'Here, just look at the way we die; watch the way we die.' Those same disciples that walked with Him and talked with Him along life's narrow way—those same disciples—some of them stuck their necks out and gave their heads. Some of them were stoned; some of them were flayed alive; some of them were hung; some of them were beaten and drug through towns by horses. The insanity of man; the evil of man took the lives of 11 of the 12 disciples. Only John was left; at the end of his life, all of the others had died for their faith and John was the only one sitting on a slave island of Patmos where Jesus appeared to him and gave him the words of the Revelation. They were faithful servants—good and faithful servants but how could you be faithful to death like that? And is that just a Bible story? Is that just a Bible story that someone would actually believe that much to where they would give their lives?—to where they would die for what they believe? It wasn't just a story to John; it was real. His best friends had given their lives and the reason why is because Yehoshua, Yeshua, Jesus had gone before them.
They had spent life with Jesus; they had seen and they had learned that the only life really worth living is one invested in the Father. They had learned by example, by the life of Jesus, who had been born in Bethlehem, who had been born into a war-ravaged world. The King of all creation was born and placed into a feeding trough. You know, out of all the time that God could have chosen to send His Son into the world, wouldn't today have been much better? He could have sent Him to America, a much more sterile world—a much better place, you know, to be cared for as an infant, but God chose that time—He chose that place. Jesus came into a war-torn world and even at the time Jesus was born, Israel was at that time actually at a time of a sort of peace. I say 'sort of' because they weren't really at war, but that's because they were in submission. It's because Rome was there and Rome was the occupier and the Nation had learned that 'as long as you don't resist, they'll leave us alone.' So for the most part they were living in peace though the world was filled with war and though there were really occupants over the land slaving the people.
 
Jesus was born into this world; He was born into this world by choice. Jesus led the way across the Jordan; He lived the life across the Jordan. He lived the life of rejection; He felt the pain and the suffering of rejection. He felt the pain of when his brothers laughed at Him and mocked Him and rolled their eyes because they thought He was crazy. Anybody feel that in your life's journey? Anybody ever feel that hurt—that struggle—that turmoil? He lived a life where He saw discouragement. He chose Judas knowing that Judas would betray Him, I believe. I believe that He had foreknowledge of that and knew it, but Jesus, though He was Emmanuel, God among us—the Scriptures tell us He was fully human and He had all human feelings the way we have feelings. And 3 years with someone, if you care about them, and Jesus obviously did, because He died on a cross, but to see them not trust would have to be discouraging. He felt the hurt—He felt the pain—He felt the bumps and bruises of everyday life.
 
The writer of Hebrews in Chapter 4:14-16 says (JR read the passage.) The writer of Hebrews says ""let us approach God's throne of grace with confidence . . .""—why? Because we have one who crossed the Jordan before us and He was tempted in every way. There is not any temptation that you have experienced that Jesus didn't experience in His flesh. The difference between He and I is vast but it is that I am a failure; I am a sinner and He wasn't. And as John says as the apostles would say 'This is the Messiah, who our eyes have seen, who our hands have touched; we have sat around the campfire with Him; we have eaten meal after meal with Him; we have seen the way He treats those who receive Him warmly; we have watched the way He interacts with those who reject Him boldly.' Jesus led the way across the Jordan to learn what is it like to live in victory; what does life in conquest of the Promised Land look like?
 
If we want to know how to live, we read the Gospels. We look at it and what did Jesus do?—He lived out the Torah. He lived out the instruction of God; He lived out 'Love God the Father first; love God first, love people second.' If you love God and you love your neighbors, guess what?—things kind of line up. Can you imagine our world if everyone did that? Can you imagine how different our world would be if everyone loved God with all their hearts, with all their minds, souls, strength and loved their neighbors as themselves? Newscasters would have no idea as to what to do! Literally! How boring it would be to tell all the stories of people loving each other all the time!  No action—no gunshots fired; they feed on that! It's a feeding frenzy. Why? Because we live in a fallen world. Jesus crossed the Jordan to show us how to live. In 1 John 3:11-16 it says this: (JR read it.)  Jesus came to show us how to live; He came to cross the Jordan. He came to live a life in conquest and ultimately life, for Him, a life of conquest meant a life of death. It meant walking up a mountain carrying a cross and being nailed to a tree because He knew if He be lifted up He would draw all men to Himself. He came across the river to show us how to die to ourselves. The problem with the world today may not be so much that we don't know how to live, but that we don't know how to die to ourselves. And if mankind could learn that, I'd just have to believe things would change.
 
On November 29, 2014, 11 years after moving to Kabul, Hannelie Groenewald was on her way home from the medical clinic in the afternoon when the driver of the car that she was riding in received a phone call. She said that his expression changed and that obviously something was going on. The driver began to tell her that there had been an uprising and that all the things they had feared as a family might actually be coming true, that there had been an attack on her home but he didn't know the extent of it. When they got a couple blocks away from her home, there were armored vehicles everywhere. They came and got her and escorted her to the home of a neighbor; she was given very little information and over the next hour or two she sat and looked at her phone reading passages of Scripture and praying for her now 16-year old son and I think 13-year old daughter and her husband who she believed to be at her house. At 5:45 she heard a massive amount of gunfire and a huge explosion and her worst fears were shortly confirmed after that. Earlier in the day three men had jumped the fence into their compound where they lived—oh, family had tried to talk them out of moving, just like most families would, but they were sure, and she was sure, that this was where God had called them to serve. God had called them to 'cross the river' so to speak, into a land where no one wants to go where there are only a few hundred Christians there to be able to speak life into anyone. The men had jumped the walls of the compound and they had gone up and during this time her husband, Werner, had been teaching a leadership thing with some young people upstairs in a little conference room they had in their house. The kids were in their rooms; Werner took the young people he was teaching and shoved them when he first heard gunshots where the guard at the door had been shot, so when he heard that, he tried to get the people into a safe area. Werner and another guy ran down the stairs to try to get out to see what was going on where they were met by their eventual killers and he was gunned down right there on the steps. They then proceeded up to the room where the two kids were now hiding in Jean Pierre's room; it was at that time they murdered their two children. They also killed some of the other people that were in the house as some of them had hidden in different places. They weren't really there for the other people; they were there for the ""missionaries""—the Jesus people—they were there to kill them. When Werner would travel to speak to groups over the years they were in Afghanistan, in each of his talks, he would almost always say this: We only die once; it might as well be for Jesus. We only die once; it might as well be for Jesus. Now Hannelie is left as a mom with no children; as a wife with no husband; two years now after her family was murdered, they asked her what her regret is. She said, ""My one and only regret is that I wanted to be there,"" as if she knew eventually this was going to happen, she said, ""I wanted to be there, especially with the children, to just embrace them and hold them and face the bullets with them."" No regret but following where she felt that God led her, just wishing she could have died with them.  Her story is shared by the Voices of the Martyrs, as kind of the lead story for the International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church which will be on November 6.  If you're interested in hearing any more about this family and their struggle, I'm sure if you google Voice of the Martyrs and go there you will find stuff.
 
Friends, Jesus led the way across the river to show us how to die and just as the Apostle John would say, 'It's not just a story; it's real.' So would this family from Kabul say it's real, but he would also say ""If you only die once,"" (unless you're Lazarus—that's the way my mind thinks—poor Lazarus, he had to go through it twice), but if you only die once, ""it might as well be for Jesus."" Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – God, you are good; we are not. God, you are good and we are not; we are sinners living in a sin-filled world. And Lord, too often we are participants in that sin-filled world and it has the potential to destroy our souls. God, I pray that we would daily place our trust and faith in you, Lord, that we would understand the struggle—the journey—is worth the effort. Lord, that this world—the comfort of this world is not our destination, but that there is something on the other side, a place where we will never die—a place where we will be free of the pain and affliction and Lord, that's our win! I pray, Lord, that you would teach us how to live but I pray more that you would teach us how to die, to die to ourselves, so that you might receive glory. Lord Jesus, if there is anyone in here today who needs to follow Joey into the river to die to themselves, I pray that today might be a day of salvation. I'm excited for Roscoe and his decision to be baptized in the next service so I pray that if there is anyone else that needs to take that first step—that infant step—that birth step of new creation that the Scriptures speak about, Lord I pray you would give them the courage to do that today and it's in the Name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",10/9/2016,
"Good morning!  It's a good day!  Nitzavim!  That's the name of the Torah portion today; it is taken from Deuteronomy 29:9 – 30:20. Nitzavim means 'You Will Stand' or 'You Will Stand One Day.' Moses said to the people this: 'Stand today all of you before the Lord your God—your chiefs, your tribes, your elders, your officers—even you, all of the men of Israel.' This portion today, Nitzavim, gives us the idea of standing before the Lord for judgment, and it's emphasizing within this portion the necessity of practicing this Hebrew word called Teshuva before we actually find ourselves standing before Him on the day of His Great White Throne Judgment because of our sins. So what in the world is this Teshuva word? Teshuva in Hebrew means repentance but there is another word found within the word Teshuva which gives us a more clear definition of what repentance really is and that word is shuv and this is what it means. It means to turn, to turn away from, or turn around to turn toward, so in other words, it means to 'turn away from our sin and turn towards God Almighty.' Nitzavim is kind of pushing us to ask ourselves the following questions: how good, how solid, how secure, how stable is my own spiritual footing in my relationship to my God? Is everything as solid as it appears to be in my walk with Him?
 
I remember several years ago Bob Stover asked me to put on a new roof for his mother, Peggy Stover, and I think it was a 3-car garage as well but I do know he has never asked me to do another roof for him since that time. I remember it was really hot and I said, ""Sure, I'd be glad to do it"" so we prepared by getting a dumpster and placing it right underneath the guttering and I go get all my gear and start stripping off the shingles and rip them off. Then I start on the roll paper and get it all off; then I start pulling all the nails out along the decking and sweep them all off and everything is looking good. I then get a phone call from JR asking me if I need some help and I said, ""Sure, no problem; come on over."" So a couple days later JR and I find ourselves standing on the roof and we start putting on the roll paper so we start at the bottom and we lay out the first strip—get it done—we go up one and lay out the next one—it's all good—we proceed to start laying out the third strip—everything is great—we are working ourselves up the peak and there I am standing on the third piece of roll paper stretched out and I'm leaning over and I started to tack on that fourth piece of roll paper going across and then all of a sudden, I started to notice my feet were starting to go down the slope and I'm exclaiming ""Oh, my goodness,""—the roll paper was starting to come off and I was headed down the slope towards the dumpster which was full of shingles and nails that were sticking upright, so I fall forward on my face--this wasn't 4 x 8 sheets of decking—this was 2 x 10's, I think stacked up one after the other, and so I fall down and there I am on this pretty steep slope. I take my fingernails and dig them in between as hard as I can in between two 2 x 10's and I'm hanging on for dear life. I'm crying out, ""Help, help"" and JR is over here just laughing his head off, and I'm screaming, ""Help me; I'm about to die,"" because I would have gone down into the dumpster full of shingles and nails upright—I would have been falling on a pin cushion and that wouldn't have been pretty. So JR finally says, ""Oh, alright, just a minute""—you know how he is—so he goes up to the top of the roof and goes across the peak and then shimmies down on his backside and throws out his hand to me—I grab onto it and he whisked me up to safety and he saves the day, but he's sitting there laughing his head off and it became readily apparent to me that what I thought was solid footing—what I thought was secure footing—what I thought was stable footing—ended up being anything but that because I almost ended up in the dumpster of life.
 
Paul warns us in 1 Corinthians 10:12 saying this: (Troy read the verse.) Proverbs 16:24 says (Troy read it.) So why is this Hebrew word Teshuva being stressed so hard in this portion called Nitzavim? It's because it is linked to the very 1st of the Fall Feasts, Rosh Hashanah, which means ""the head of the year"" but it is also associated with the 2nd Coming of the Lord. That's why it is being stressed to Teshuva—to repent, to turn away from and to turn towards that which is righteous. Rosh Hashanah is also known as the Feast of Trumpets, or in Hebrew it is known as Yom Teruah, which is the Day of the ""Awakening"" Blast. It's a call to wake up, so his bride will be ready when the groom returns. Will we be, as His bride, ready for His return as our groom? Will we have repented as the Messiah sounds His shofar and returns to this earth? It will kind of be like the parable of the 10 virgins. (Here Troy read Matthew 25:1-5, pausing after 5a.) Now why was the Bridegroom, Jesus, delaying? Because He was away preparing a place for His bride to take her with Him when He comes back. (Troy continued reading Verses 5-13.) Who among us will be wise? Who among us will be foolish? You see this passage is mirroring part of the Jewish wedding when the groom went away and prepared a place for the bride to come back and take her to be with him. Someone wrote it like this: If the young woman accepted the young man's proposal, then before leaving the young man would announce by saying, ""I am going away to prepare a place for you and I will return for you one day when it is ready."" The usual practice was for the young man to return to his father's house and build a honeymoon room there for her and he was not allowed to skimp on the work and had to get his father's approval before he could consider it ready for his bride. If asked the date of his wedding, he would have to reply, ""Only my Father knows the day of the wedding."" In the groom's absence the bride would be making herself ready so that she would be pure and spotless and holy and beautiful to receive the groom when he comes back, and when the wedding chamber was ready and the Son had the Father's approval, then the bridegroom could go and collect his bride. He could do this at any time that he chose, so the bride always had to have herself ready and always be watching for the groom's return. As a matter of fact, it was actually a custom for a bride to keep a lamp near her bed, along with her veil and some other things, and the bridesmaids also had to be waiting for the groom's return and they had to have oil in their lamps ready as well. It is written that when the groom and his friends got close to the bride's house, he did two things: they would give a SHOUT and to BLOW A SHOFAR to let the bride know her groom was coming. The groom is coming; he is on the way, and this is simply a foreshadowing of what it will be like for us when He returns for His bride.
 
So why is it that so many people are saying that Rosh Hashanah could be the day of the Lord's return? This is why: they look at the spring feasts and how they were fulfilled PERFECTLY. Passover = Jesus fulfilled Passover ON the exact day of Passover, the anniversary of the Passover in Egypt. Unleavened Bread = He was laid in the grave ON the exact same night when the feast of Unleavened Bread began—the anniversary day of when the Hebrews left Egypt. First Fruits = He rose from the grave ON the exact day of First Fruits, the anniversary of when the Jews crossed the Red Sea on dry ground. Pentecost/Shavuot = He fulfilled Pentecost ON the exact day of Pentecost, the anniversary of Moses giving the Torah at Mt. Sinai. So here is the thinking: IF HE FULFILLED ALL THE SPRING FEASTS WITH SUCH PRECISION ON THE DATES WHEN THEY ACTUALLY OCCURRED, IS IT UNREASONABLE TO THINK THAT THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT HE WILL DO THE SAME WITH THE FALL FEASTS, WITH THE SAME TYPE OF PRECISION, ON THE DATES WHEN THEY ARE SLATED TO OCCUR? Is it possible? We can't be dogmatic about it; Scriptures say 'No one knows the day or the hour,' but when you look at the spring feasts and the way they were fulfilled with such precision, I would say it is a possibility.
 
So Teshuva is an absolute must in our lives, as a church, to prepare us and to make us ready to stand before the Lord on Judgment Day. That day is going to be a horrible day for many people when He returns—a horrible day—an indescribable day, but it's going to be a wonderful day for many people as well. Which side will we be on? You see, if you were in Jerusalem on the Feast of Trumpets in ancient times you would have heard the temple trumpeter standing on the southwest corner of the Temple Mount blowing his shofar letting it ring out over the City of David and it would have sounded something like this: (Here Jeroen sounded a shofar) and when that shofar sounded it was to be a reminder for the people to repent—to Teshuva—because the Lord is coming—it's the Lord's Return—His 2nd Coming! And one day it won't be Jeroen's shofar or the temple trumpeter's shofar blowing—it will be the Shofar of the Messiah Himself ringing out over the entire earth and they will hear His blast.
 
1 Corinthians 15:51-53 says this: (Troy read the verses.) The Apostle Paul put it this way in 1 Thessalonians 4:16-18 (Troy read it.) And at that moment we will probably be reminded of John the Revelator, when he said in Revelation 11:15 (Troy read it.) But it's hard sometimes; it's hard sometimes to hang on when life keeps throwing its punches into our gut and we get bruised and beaten down and I suspect that's why Paul said these words:  (Troy read Hebrews 10:35-37.) 
 
So here's the question for us as we move into the time of theses fall feasts, beginning with Yom Teruah, the Day of the Awakening Blast, we have to ask ourselves this question: Is my footing built on the solid rock or is it built on the sand? Matthew 7:24-27 (Troy read the passage.)  So will we be ready for the Groom's return or will be caught off guard? I remember I was at the license branch, just a few weeks ago—a couple months ago—I was just sitting there in my vehicle just minding my own business; I was reading a book waiting on my son to meet me at the license branch as we had some business to do and while I was hanging out there waiting on Jadon—it was a beautiful day—I had my windows down—the sun was shining and I could hear the birds chirping—I mean it was just perfect and while I was sitting there focusing on the book I was reading, all of a sudden—BOOM! I feel this tremendous thud, but I wasn't moving—I was just sitting quietly in a parking space—that's it! After I heard the noise and felt the thud, I glance up and look into the rearview mirror. I then see this car behind me at my right rear fender and there she was—a 16-year old girl who was hanging her head down and sitting right next to her was the license branch examiner. You know, that wasn't funny and it took everything I had not to laugh but I could see what had happened and what was going on. She got out of the car and was in tears—the examiner got out and she came over to where I was and I got out and there we all were and I was just trying to hold it in, you know; she was a mess. What had happened was she was two spaces over from me—they had gone out and she was doing her driving test but when she backed out of her parking space, she tried to make the turn but she saw that she wasn't going to make the turn so all of a sudden, she hit the accelerator and she just gunned it and boom, right into the back of my vehicle. What happened next was funnier in a way. You could see the mother who had been looking out through the big glass of the branch's window and she comes running out; she is flustered and all upset so she comes over to the examiner—I'm still standing there so I am listening to this—and she asks, ""Well, what does this mean for her test?"" The license branch examiner looked at her and said, ""Well, honey, this is going to be an automatic fail."" You think???? You know, I probably did laugh at that point—I confess—but in that moment I had been caught OFF GUARD!  But God tells us in 1 Thessalonians 5:4 through the Apostle Paul (Troy read it.)  In 2 Chronicles 7:14 it says this: (Troy read it.) 
 
You see God has set up life to be a journey and hopefully at the end of that we will find ourselves standing in the Holy Presence of God and a snapshot of what a successful journey looks like is laid out for us in the three appointed feasts of the Lord where the Jews were commanded to go up to Jerusalem to celebrate and it shows us what is needed for us to make it a successful journey. First, we have Passover which occurs in the early spring and in the first month that begins the cycle of the feasts; then in the third month comes Pentecost and finally in the seventh month comes God's Feast of Tabernacles.
 
So let's do a quick review of these feasts. 
          PASSOVER = is a celebration of God's Redemption and His Cleansing. What is redemption? It is ""covered by the blood."" What is cleansing? It is the ""removal of impurity of sin in our lives.""
 
          The second feast in the 3rd month is called PENTECOST. What is Pentecost? It is a celebration of God's provision for the people. It was the 1st fruit of the Wheat Harvest that was brought in and it signifies God's physical provision for the people. Then on Pentecost God also gave the Torah to the people on Mt. Sinai; this signifies God's spiritual provision for the people and finally, also on Pentecost, in Acts 2 this is when God gave the Holy Spirit to the people and this signified provision for them because He gave them a helper—He gave them an advocate.
 
          So we have PASSOVER; PENTECOST—then we have the long, hot dry summer and on the other side of that long, hot dry summer we finally move into the fall when you come into the celebration of the Fall Feasts, here specifically, TABERNACLES. What is Tabernacles? That is actually when people dwell in the Shekinah glory—in the Presence of God Almighty on Mount Zion in Jerusalem when He is 'tabernacling' amongst His people.
 
Now here is the really interesting part I came across: when you compare these 3 feasts with the 3 courts found in Moses' tabernacle, you have stunning similarities. So again, Passover is about redemption and cleansing; you go to the outer court in the Tabernacle and you find the exact same thing. It's about redemption and cleansing—how so? You have the altar and the laver, the altar was where blood sacrifices took place—burnt offerings took place—and sins were atoned for (redemption); then you also have the laver which was a place of cleansing. This is where the priest would come in and he would have to wash and cleanse himself for impurities before moving into the next court. 
 
Then we come to Pentecost; what was Pentecost? Again, it was about God's Provision. So we look at the next place you move into in the Tabernacle and it is called the Holy Place. How do we see God's Provision there? We see items in there, one of which is the Table of Showbread, where every week they put bread out to thank God that He brings forth bread from the earth. (We see God meeting their physical needs.) We also see God's Provision in the Menorah that is in there; it is a symbol of the Holy Spirit—again it is a symbol of God's Provision because that is the idea of Him giving us the helper or the advocate to help us find our way. And finally you come to the Altar of Incense which is also a symbol of God's Provision because this is the idea of the prayers of the saints go up in smoke rising up as a sweet fragrance to the Lord and we see God giving provision to the people through accessing Him through prayer.
 
So we have the OUTER COURT, we have the Holy Place in the Tabernacle. Then we have the VEIL and on the other side of the veil we see the Holy of Holies. The Tabernacle is actually about dwelling in the Holy Presence of God with His people and then in the Holy of Holies, we have God dwelling His Shekinah glory over the Ark of the Covenant in the context of being in the midst of His people. So as we lay this out . . . does anyone see any comparison between these two? This is giving us a picture of what is needed for us making it one day into the Presence of God ourselves as a church. We need His Redemption; we need His Cleansing and as we travel along, we need Him to make provision for us ultimately landing us in the Presence of the Lord. But, none of this can occur without Teshuva—without repentance, to get us ready as the bride.
 
There was a lady in the New Testament who understood what Teshuva meant. She got it! Most of the time the Jews wouldn't go through Samaria; when they left Judea they would go around the side and go up north and come back into the Galilee to avoid Samaria, but Jesus in John 4 didn't do that. He made a beeline from Judea straight up into Ephraim and north into Samaria to a little place called Sychar. And there was a Samaritan woman who lived there and she had come out to the well to draw water one day and Jesus asked her for a drink. She is utterly shocked that He would speak to her because Jews usually wouldn't speak to Samaritans whatsoever; she was not only a Samaritan but this woman was a woman with a reputation; her own people probably didn't talk to her as it was the norm for her—it was what she expected that no one would give her the time of day as they would shun her for who she was and what she was doing and what she had done. We have to understand that this woman was a complete outcast. As the story unfolds we learn that she had gone from husband to husband and after her 5th husband she gave up on the pretense of marriage and had moved in with her boyfriend—in that society that would make her a little more than a prostitute. She didn't come out in the morning to draw water like the other women did; she waited until they were all gone and then she came out when she would be alone so she didn't have to interact with anyone. Her shame was too great upon her shoulders; she was considered the lowest of the low. Yet, even as society viewed this woman in this way, Jesus saw her differently and He had something for this woman. Jesus said, ""If you knew who I am, you would have asked me, and I would have given you Living Water for whoever drinks the water I give shall never thirst again. The water I give will become a fountain of water welling up to eternal life."" And as she listened to Jesus' words, something happened in the heart of this woman—something pierced through her soul and a radical transformation took place as if she had a wake-up call. She decides to make Teshuva—it's like she is hearing the Messiah's shofar blasting in her own life and she runs back to the town and brings the whole village out to meet Jesus. But she didn't stop there!
 
Early Christian writers tell us this woman's name was Photine. Now, we have no idea if her name was Photine or not, but that's what the early Christian writers decided to call her but after she had her encounter with Jesus and had brought everyone from the town out to meet Jesus, she also ended up leading her 5 sisters to the Lord and didn't stop there; she also led her 2 brothers to the Lord and they ALL became tireless proclaimers of God's Truth to others!!!  Later, she was sent out as a missionary, and this woman at the well went to Carthage—she actually went into Africa and became a missionary there sharing the Gospel with as many people as possible. However, it's recorded by those Christian writers that she was eventually martyred for her faith in God under the rule of the cruel Roman emperor, Nero. She would not deny Jesus as the King of her life and as a result of her proclamation of that faith, under Nero's orders, her skin was flayed off of her body, as well as her legs were dismembered; although it was disputed, some writers recorded that what was left of her body was thrown down . . . of all things—a well!  Ironically, the very place where she ended up initially meeting her Groom to be . . . and she said ""yes"" to making herself a part of the Bride, that Jesus would later come and redeem her and would later come back to take her to the place where He had been preparing for her all along. 
 
As I close this morning, there is an interesting aspect how in ancient times people would worship false gods in comparison to the Tabernacle of Moses. You see what they did was when they decided to worship false gods—things of the world—what they would do was they would turn and they would face toward the east. In fact in Ezekiel 8:16 (Troy read it.) So if you decided to worship the things of the world—the pagans and the idols, etc.,-- guess what you had to do? You had to face towards the east. The interesting thing is that the Tabernacle of Moses also faces towards the east so if you're worshipping the things of the world and you're facing the east, guess what you're doing to the Tabernacle of Moses, and more specifically, to the Shekinah glory of God which is resting over the Ark of the Covenant?—what would you be doing?  You would be turning your back on God Almighty in order to worship the things of the world. But if we Teshuva and we decide to turn around the other way and we turn and face the Lord and begin worshipping Him, now what is behind us?—the things of the world—false gods—the idols. I found that to be an interesting comment when God says, ""Have you seen this, Son of Man?--is this just a trivial matter for the people of Judah to be doing this detestable thing?""
 
Teshuva—where will we be?  Will we be considered among the wise or will be considered among the foolish?  Will we have our lamps full of oil or will our lamps be needing the extra oil? Will we be caught facing the east?—turning our back to the Lord God Almighty when He returns, or will we be facing the direction of the Messiah preparing ourselves and getting ourselves ready for His return? Which way will we be facing?
 
I find it very interesting and I will close with this verse found in Revelation 22:20.  Now you are the Bride, along with ethnic Jews who are Messianic believers who believe in Jesus Christ as their Messiah and Gentile believers—us—we are all the Bride. Guys, I cannot express enough how important this answer is to 'where are we going to find ourselves?'—it's so hard to get this when we live in this world but one day the Lord is going to come back and the clouds are going to be peeled back like a scroll and that trumpet is going to blow and the Messiah is going to come riding on His white horse to retrieve His Bride and He is going to take her to be with Him, but where will you be found? Where are you going to be? Please hear these words—for your coworkers—for your family—for your relatives—what's it going to be for them? And of all the words that Jesus could have left with us, His final parting words to us in the book of Revelation 22:20 are (Troy read the first half of the verse.) Why say that?  I AM COMING SOON!  He is coming soon. Amen!—which means 'let it be.' The last 3 words of that verse are ""Come Lord Jesus."" Will you be a part of the Bride ready to receive Him? Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Lord, thank you for our time here this morning.  Father, this is the message you gave me today; Lord, help us to Teshuva; help us to understand that is to help us prepare ourselves for the first of the Fall Feasts which is talking about the new year and more about your 2nd coming—your return! One day you're coming back and Father, it's my prayer—Jesus, that we are ready! I pray we will have our lamps full of oil—trimmed and ready to go. We love you so much and we look so forward to that day, Lord. Please be with those, Father, who do not know you as being their Groom yet and I pray you will bring them into the fold. It's in Jesus' Name that we pray and worship you this morning. Amen!",Troy White,"Arcadia, IN",10/2/2016,
"In 1979 the front office traded him and Pedro Borbon of the Cincinnati Reds was irate—he was irate! He had been there several years and had been through the World Series—it was the era of the Big Red Machine—and they put him on the trade block. Rumor had it for years that Pedro Borbon—then him being from the Dominican Republic—he put a voodoo curse upon the Cincinnati Reds that would last until the final front office person who had been involved in his trade left the organization and was gone. Early 1990 the last one left and that fall the Cincinnati Reds won the World Series. Coincidence? I don't know. In 2002 Pedro Borbon, after all those years and all the rumors Pedro Borbon came out and said it was all a hoax, so I don't know.
 
In 1918 the Bambino was sold. Up until 1918 the Boston Red Sox had won 5 World Series—they had won the very first World Series when baseball was just really getting going then so they were considered the premiere franchise in the world. The Bambino was sold to the lowly New York Yankees and from then on for the next 86 years there was this stigma of the curse of the Bambino, which I'm sure many of you have heard and remember the chatter about; for 86 years the New York Yankees became THE NEW YORK YANKEES and the Boston Red Sox couldn't win anything. Was the curse real? I don't know—that will be up to God to decide, but we hear about these curses.
 
The Thirsk Museum in England is home to the infamous Thomas Busby chair. The Thomas Busby chair is there and it is mounted up on a wall where no one can sit in it. The reason is because, according to the legend, anyone who sits on the Busby chair dies—like soon! It all started in North Yorkshire back in 1702 where somehow the town drunk, Thomas Busby, managed to marry a beautiful girl, named Elizabeth Awtey. Her father, Daniel Awtey, was really opposed to the marriage as he thought for sure that she could do better. There was a lot of conflict—a lot of controversy—one day a drunk Busby came home from work and the father-in-law is sitting in his favorite chair; he is there to retrieve his daughter. He announced that he was taking her because he believed she could do better than Busby, so like any rational man, Thomas Busby grabbed a hammer and bludgeoned Daniel Awtey to death on the spot. He was sentenced to be executed and as he was being led away to be executed, it was reported that Busby shouted at that time that anyone who sat in his favorite chair would die. Then the legend took hold; the home where he had lived was turned into the Busby Stoop Inn; the legend continued through all the years where all the reports included people dying after sitting in that chair. In 1968 Tony Earnshaw bought and took over the management of the Busby Stoop Inn; he wasn't a superstitious man and he didn't believe any part of the curse—he thought it was nonsense and that it was actually good for business because those kinds of things tend to attract people, but then all of a sudden people connected with him in the thing that he had heard and they started to die. There were two airmen in his restaurant who dared each other to sit in it, which they did, and later that day both of those men died in a plane crash. Then there was a group of builders that came into the pub one day at lunchtime and they dared a young worker to sit in the chair, which he obliged them by doing, and later that afternoon he fell off the roof of a house and smashed his head open on the concrete below. Tony Earnshaw said that was it so he took the Busby chair to the Thirsk Museum in England and he begged them to take it under one condition—that no one would ever be able to sit in the chair again. So if you go into that museum today you will see that chair fastened way up on the wall where it can be seen, but no one can actually get to it. Were the curses real?  I don't know whether they were real or not—again, that is up for God to decide. Do I believe that Satan can work in demonic ways in the world?—sure, I do.  I saw it live in the pages of the New Testament when Jesus walked this earth, so is it possible?—sure, it can be possible—I don't know how that stuff happens today.
 
Today I want us to see, as we get into the Torah portion, I want us to read the last verse of the book of Malachi which happens to be the last verse of the Old Testament. I'm actually going to look at the last two verses of what we call the Old Testament. (JR read Malachi 4:5-6.) The very last word of the Old Testament, or what we call the Old Testament, is ""curse."" The world was living in a time—in a period—where the curse of God had been applied. Now I don't know about Pedro Borbon and I don't know about Babe Ruth and I don't know about Thomas Busby—I don't know about those curses, but I know when God says He would place the world under a curse if the world doesn't live in unity with Him or walk the direction He says, I believe that for sure to be true. And so we have this whole idea of the curse. When Jesus comes onto the scene in what we call the New Testament, starting in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John--the Gospels—when Jesus comes onto the scene, we find Him and His cousin, John the Baptist, both preaching the same message—'Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near.' Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near—repent.  And I'm not focusing on the latter part right now, but more the front part of it—REPENT, REPENT, REPENT, REPENT! Turn back to God's instruction; turn back to God's Torah—turn from the direction in which you are headed because the direction in which you are headed is going to end in a fatal crushing blow, because the curse has been pronounced. The whole idea of 'repent, repent, repent,' was because of this issue of this 5-letter word ""curse."" There's a curse and the only way to avoid the curse was repentance—for people to draw back to God. In Matthew 23 we find a period there where Jesus is speaking really soon before He goes to the cross and He is speaking to the religious leaders and it is the famous ""woe passages"" where He says, ""Woe to you, woe to you, woe to you,""—bottom line = cursed. Cursed! These are the curses of God being lived out. And we could all probably point out some similarity of that in our own lives where in periods of time we have walked opposed to God's Torah—opposed to God's instruction—opposed to God's Word—opposed to God's direction and how we have essentially brought a curse upon ourselves and we can look back and we can see in the wake of our bad decisions how 'you reap what you sow,' and how those things tend to play themselves out.
 
This week's Torah portion is Ki Tavo = Deuteronomy 26:1 – 29:9 and we're going to really focus on Chapter 28 today. As they get into this portion the Israelites are told that when they go into the land, half of their tribes are to go Mount Ebal and half of the tribes are to go to Mount Gerizim and from Mount Ebal, the curses that God pronounces upon the Nation for disobedience are to be read. These are two mountains that face each other and then from Mount Gerizim the blessings for obedience are to be read. So we have this picture as we open this portion of the Torah—this picture of God saying—and you know this is typical of any life of any family with kids. We don't maybe call it ""curses"" and ""blessings"" and we may not write it out per se but if you do your chores, things will go well for you; if you don't do your chores, things won't go so well. Alright, maybe we don't call it a curse, and then when they get mad because they're cursed, they blame who typically?—the parents, right? And it's the same type of thing with us; we go through life and live the way we want—we live in rebellion to God so often and then we blame Him for the problems that occur. You know God has said, 'You do your chores—you live in righteousness—things will tend to work themselves out.' Now here's the thing: it doesn't always work that way in this wicked world—you could be marching in step with God and Satan can still attack. That's the world we live in—the cursed world that we live in!
 
So let's look at Deuteronomy 28 where you will find the blessings and the curses. These blessings and curses find themselves, like I said, all the way into the New Testament. You look at these blessings and you go to Jesus' most famous sermon ever—the Sermon on the Mount—and what does He start with?—""Blessed are you . . ."" and He goes on to give more. The whole idea of the Torah is to love God and to love people. Love God and love people—Jesus said it can all be summarized that way—it doesn't mean all the other laws aren't important, but He says they all revolve around those two things. ""Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul, and with all your strength. Do that first and love the people around you""—Jesus specified ""Love your neighbor,"" but who is your neighbor? Even your enemy is your neighbor. Jesus took the Torah and He didn't change it; He just took it to greater depths. He just took it to greater depths of spiritual explanation on what those things mean. And so here is this whole section of the blessings and the curses and they are so intertwined with the New Testament.
 
I want to look at Deuteronomy 28:15 to start with. (JR read it.) And then goes into this long list of verse after verse after verse after verse after verse after verse of curses. So what does He say? ""Obey and you're blessed,""—take out the trash—things will go well for you; don't take out the trash—things don't go well for you.  Typical world that we live in now—blessings and curses! And I will tell you that within that Verse 15 the life of the Nation of Israel really is painted. It's really painted and if we skip forward in this chapter to Verse 49—it starts to get toward the end of the curses, although there is still a ways to go, but it gets to kind of the climax. You know—today—you're grounded and you can't watch TV; well a lot of kids today don't watch TV like we did back in our time; I mean there are just differences. Today the climax—the worst of all worst—it's not 'don't take away my car'—it's now 'don't take my phone. You take my phone—that's my life! That's all my connections to my friends so take the car, take the TV, take whatever, but don't take my phone.' And here we kind of come to the climax of the curses. (JR read Verses 49-52.) Skip on down to Verse 64 and it keeps going—I'm not going to read all of that—(JR read Verses 64-65.) Friends, that right there—those verses that I just read are the picture of the Nation of Israel since the time of A.D. 70.  God said, 'I will send a nation,' (and this is all the way back in the Book of Deuteronomy) in to distribute you among all the nations of the world. That wasn't Nebuchadnezzar; Nebuchadnezzar took them where?—to Babylon. That wasn't even the Assyrian invasion; it wasn't the Egyptian invasion because that was after the Egyptian invasion. This is talking about Rome. This is talking about A.D. 70 when they would be uprooted and they would be taken and they would be dispersed among all the nations of the world. This, my friends, goes back to the miracle of the Bible which blows my mind, that for 2000 years—notice what He doesn't say—(do you know what the symbol of Rome was?—it was an eagle) and He says here that the eagle is going to swoop in and take you—notice what He doesn't say. He doesn't say that 'I am going to take you and you will be distributed into all the nations of the world and you will become assimilated into them and become like them and lose your identity;' He says 'You will be sent in there and you will continue to suffer—a people who will continually have their identity.' We go back in to the Old Testament and God says thing after thing after thing about the Jewish people being His people forever and He says He would give them the Sabbath as a memorial—as a declaration—between the people of Israel and God forever.
 
Even today—a little more than 50 years after they were restored to their land, the Jewish people are distributed still amongst the nations of the world—not having lost their identity, but instead God preserving them—God protecting them—God keeping them. When I say 'God protecting them,' are they under punishment?—oh, great punishment. In the time they've been spending in the world, has it been pleasant? It's been lived out like He just said. He said, 'There will be no rest for the soles of your feet; your hearts will be heavy—there will be anxiety.' I was reading an article just last night on Abraham Lincoln and the fact that Abraham Lincoln was killed on Resurrection Day weekend and in some ways A. Lincoln was seen as a savior. I'm assuming none of you were alive at that time but you have gone back and read the historical accounts. If any of you were around at that time, please come and tell me how the atmosphere was like because I was trying to discern how A. Lincoln and this whole thing was connected and it was said that the people and the newspapers at that time didn't so much connect him to being a savior like Jesus on His Crucifixion and that part of the story, but the newspapers were more connecting him to Moses and being a Jewish Savior of Passover of sorts by bringing African-Americans out of slavery. I found it interesting because one of the newspaper articles that I read was on that story and was a story from the Chicago Tribune or whatever the leading newspaper was in Chicago at that time and they were talking about A. Lincoln and the rescuing of the slaves and how he was like Moses, etc., and then there was a paragraph in there that was just this vile, wretched diatribe about how wretched and wicked and evil Jewish people are and how they are getting what they deserve because they didn't repent and I thought 'Wow,' it was just one of those things that gets inserted into an article that really kind of didn't have anything to do with the context of the story—it was a sub-plot—and the article really took off on them. But that's the type of mindset—that's the type of mentality the Jewish people have had to deal with—now, it's because they didn't take out the trash! Is it self-imposed?—yeah, it's self-imposed, but it's not just self-imposed—it's God-imposed! God said, 'If you don't, then these are the curses which will come.'
When Jesus shows up on the scene, He and John the Baptist are saying what?—they are saying, 'Repent, repent, repent,' because the curse is about to come and at this point Jesus knew; He knew that this part that I just read—that they were going to be distributed into all the world--was just about to take place and when they asked Jesus for a sign, He actually gave them that as a sign. What was the sign?—He said, 'I'm just going to give you one—destroy this body and I will rise' and He connected that to the Temple. He later in His teaching said to His disciples, 'This temple—not one stone is going to be left upon another—not one stone; a storm is coming.' He could have gone into this and said, 'Do you remember back in Deuteronomy 28, God has told us,' and I say Jesus says ""us"" because He is a Jew and He was part of that Jewish family and He was part of that Jewish heritage, 'God told us in Deuteronomy 28 that a storm was on the horizon that if you don't take out the trash, you will suffer the consequences—repent; repent; repent.'
 
The Jews have suffered these things and experienced these things not because God doesn't love them, but I believe, because He does love them. When I punish my child for not doing what he's supposed to do, is it because I don't love them, or is it because I do? It's because I do. Now, they may rebel against that; they may speak differently about that—they may say that's not why I'm doing it, but we know the truth—right? We know that the direction they are headed is not positive so we have to steer them back to the right path.
 
Now, how does this connect to Jesus? Where do we find Jesus in this?  I mean, I think it's pretty self-evident but let's look at a few verses in particular. In Deuteronomy 28:29 in the midst of these curses, He says: (JR read it.) At mid-day you will grope about like a blind person in the dark. Let's go back to the Crucifixion of Jesus. What happened at noon? God brought darkness over the land. The thing is that God doesn't say things for no reason or no purpose. He doesn't just throw things out there because they sound good poetically; He says them for a reason and here He chooses, through Moses, a specific statement that at 'mid-day you will grope about . . . .' If you think that I'm taking that too far, let's see what the Prophet Amos has to say about that same thing. Amos 8:9-10 the Prophet Amos says this: (JR read the passage.) That was pretty visual and what was that day of Crucifixion—it was Passover—it was a time of great celebration and that time of great celebration, all of a sudden, hinges and swings to the Crucifixion of the Son of God. If you don't think that's what He was talking about, look further: (JR read the very end of Verse 10.) Who was Jesus? He was God's only begotten Son, so here in the curses of the Torah, we find a picture of Jesus.
 
Look at Deuteronomy 28:30; it says this: (JR read it.)  I don't have time to read any more; my original intent was just to focus on that verse today, but I'm going to let you pursue this on your own. He gives them 3 things there: He gives them a picture of a woman/wife—a house—and a vineyard. I will tell you that the wife/woman is Zion; if you think that's stretching it, turn to Isaiah 54 and read Verse 5 where He says, 'I will take Zion to be my wife.' The wife is Zion; the house is the Temple; the vineyard is the Nation of Israel. God says those three things are going to be destroyed; they will be reeling and they will be struggling. What is the picture of restoration? The picture of restoration that we have from the prophets—from the 66 books of the Bible—is that the Messiah comes to restore—He comes to restore Zion—He comes to restore the Temple—and He comes to restore the Nation of Israel. He restores the Temple through Himself because He is the Temple. 
 
Let's look at Verses 31 and 32. (JR read them.) In my studies, I found that the picture of the ox in Verse 31 is the picture of the Messiah. That the ""ox will be slaughtered before your eyes,"" and that that generation really, for the most part, partook in none of it. (JR continued re-reading Verse 31.) The people who really suffered in Israel in the day of Jesus—it wasn't the religious—it was the common folk who really suffered; they really suffered because of a lack of leadership. Anybody in America believe we are suffering today because of a lack of leadership? Friends, we have a leadership vacuum in this nation and it's not a political issue; it's a leadership issue. It's not a red or blue issue; it's a leadership issue. And we are suffering. We don't even know what the real problems are; we don't even know what the real issues are. If you turn on the TV this afternoon and you just watch the news—I don't care which station or channel you pick; just tune in and watch the arguments they are talking about. We argue and bicker and fight and squabble about symptoms. Those are not the real issues. WE ARE IN A CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY! And we are blind and it's the common folk who suffer, and we need to get it figured out as a nation, and it's not but one person that can change it and they're not running for President. They already hold the office of KING! And that's who can change it! 
 
In the secular mind—I'm going to preach a little more on this. The secular mind would say, ""JR, that's crap; that's hogwash—that's ridiculous."" Well, tell me how it's getting us going, secular—how we doing? Is it working? You think this is working? Because frankly, I don't. I believe God has more in store for us and wants more for us than the garbage can we're turning His world into—the thing He created. He created it as good—and that's not a go-green statement. I'm not talking about polluting the environment, although I don't think we should be polluting the environment—this is about sin polluting the world—not about throwing garbage in a hole.
 
""Your sheep will be given to your enemies . . . ."" When Rome captured Jerusalem in A.D. 70 there were tons of Jewish young people that were taken and sold into slavery. (JR then read Verse 32.) It's the picture of their plight of 2,000 years; this is a picture of the Jewish people. I would encourage you to turn to Galatians 3:10 ff. Here Paul deals with the curse—the curse that we're struggling through—the curse that we're fighting with. Paul says this, starting in Verse 10. (JR paused after reading Verse 10.) The Book of the Law is not a curse—it pronounces a curse, but the Law, the Torah, of God is not a curse—the Torah of God is a BLESSING!  How can God's instruction be a curse? Notice that Paul says ""All who rely on observing the Torah; all who rely on observing the Law are under a curse."" If your reliance is on your obedience, you're in trouble because Paul says what?—""It is not by works of righteousness that I have done but according to His mercy that He saved me."" The Law is only a curse in the aspect that we can't live up to it; it's a high standard. God didn't mess up and had to have a redo with Jesus; that's why Jesus affirmed the Torah of God. He says, (JR continued reading Verse 11 pausing after.) You're not good enough to live it out. (JR continued reading Verses 12-17.) Paul is saying the promise that God gave to Abraham—the Law does not set that aside. God means what He says! The promise of God is affirmed. (JR read Verse 18.) Then you have to go back and see what the promise was. And the promise was that God was going to give a blessing to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and to his sons FOREVER! And I hear people say all the time, 'Well, the Law was nailed to the cross.' Well, Paul says the Law and the promise aren't the same thing anyway so if you use that argument, it's an argument of fallacy. In what I just read there, Paul says that God sent Jesus to die so that we Gentiles can be partakers in the promise. If the promise was nailed to the tree, your promise was nailed to the tree and you can't trust it.
 
The curse of trying to be good enough was nailed to the tree!—BECAUSE WE CAN'T!—except through Jesus! Paul teaches that when we stand before God in Jesus, we stand before God in HIS righteousness and He lived a perfect life unless you say, 'He was a Torah breaker,' and if He was a Torah breaker, then He didn't live a perfect life and He's not a perfect Savior.
 
The last chapter of the Bible—Revelation 22—I'm just going to give you one statement; it's not the very last verse like Malachi but it is close. In Revelation 21 and 22 we have the picture of Heaven. (JR read Revelation 22:1-2.) (Then JR read the first 7 words of Verse 3.) 
 
          ""No longer will there be any curse."" Friends, the effect of the curse are still here today; we see it. Anyone who tells us that through Jesus that the Kingdom of God that He wanted is here on this earth through us and this is what God expects has got far short expectations of God because if what I see in the life of the church is the hurt and the pain that I have to deal with every week that people go through—God says here 'there won't be any curse anymore,'—I long for that day as a pastor. And I'm telling you, Church, it's here in part but it is not here in full and anybody that tells you that we don't have something bigger and better to expect when God is going to heal our land and heal our people, those who are connected to the sacrifice of Jesus—through His Person—through His Grace—through His Mercy, don't listen to them, because it is coming. It is the picture that is the Bible, from Genesis to Revelation. If you cut out certain books and certain sections, you could paint a different picture, but if you take it all, you can see there was a curse—there was a penalty, and God had the ability and the desire and the willingness to restore what was broken. The only question is whether or not you will choose to live under the curse or whether or not you will choose to be attached to the Grace of God.  Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Lord, Jesus, thank you that this is not all that we have to look forward to. Lord, I see the suffering and the pain and the agony in people's lives, almost daily and they are people who are Christians. They are people who are adopted; people who are engrafted into the promise to Abraham and they suffer. This kingdom that we are experiencing now is part of the Kingdom; we have the Spirit, but it's not here in its fullness—but it is coming! Lord, may we remain faithful. May we clutch hold of your Tallit—your prayer shawl, just like the woman who was bleeding. May we grab the hem of your robe and allow you to take us on a journey. Lord, may we trust you in the Name of Jesus. Amen!",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",9/25/2016,
"First I want to announce that on the evening of October 1, which I believe is a Saturday, there will be a block party held at the Cicero Christian Church in that grassy area where they have a shelter house and the point of it is to recognize, to honor, and to encourage our local law enforcement. I really want to encourage you to think and pray about being a part of that; I can get you more details next week but I think it is from 6 – 9 p.m.  The local law enforcement would include anybody that worships in our churches, so not necessarily a Cicero policeman or an Arcadia or whatever, it will be for anyone connected with our community. With that being said, I need someone, because I am not going to be here on October 1, so I need someone who will step up and kind of help me be a point person to work with Adam Colter, minister at CCC finishing up a few things and be kind of our rah-rah cheer person here. I don't think it will be a big, huge thing but if you are interested in that, please let me know. I told him during a brief conversation on the phone that I would try to find somebody to connect with him that can do that. We have police and law enforcement in this congregation and we want to honor them and so if anyone is willing or available to step in and do that, see me afterwards. Also, I want to remind you that today is the 2nd Sunday where we will have a special offering for Derek and Kristin Duvall who will be traveling to Salt Lake City to plant the Awakened City Church there. Last Sunday the initial offering was a little over $2100 and so I'm encouraged by that so make a note of that as we get into our offering time today. One more thing—on October 30—and we're a little bit sketchy on details—it's not set in concrete but I want to put this date before you that on that date we will have finished our year-long Torah study and that following weekend our plan, at this point, is to have a celebration with the Tabernacle—I've talked to you about that before that we intend to build the Tabernacle out here and we will have the Tabernacle celebration that weekend and on that Sunday morning, church service will possibly be one service only and we will have it outdoors if the weather permits. What I'm hoping and dreaming for is to do a 10:00 a.m. having one church service around the Tabernacle to be followed by lunch together, maybe a cook-out, so be praying and thinking about that and how those things can take place. Again, they're not etched in stone—these are dreams and things I am hoping will come to fruition.  Let's pray.
 
Opening Prayer – God, thank you so much for today. Lord, we ask your presence here; if we are meeting together and you are not here, then we might as well go home because we are here to honor you. We are not here to be built up necessarily—really, that shouldn't be our motivation. Our motivation, Lord, shouldn't be here to be fed. Our motivation should be that we are here to give you glory and honor and praise because you, Lord, are the one who created all things and you have given us life and you have redeemed us so Lord, we come here today to acknowledge you and say thank you. God, I pray that you bless our time and that you speak into our hearts and that we hear your voice and it's in Jesus' Name we pray, Amen.
 
Our Torah portion this week is Ki Tetze; it is found in Deuteronomy 21:10 through 25:19. We are going to do a rapid fire going through the first few segments. This Torah portion contains a lot of rules and regulations that He is repeating that were already talked about in the books of Exodus and Leviticus so since we are doing shadows of Jesus trying to find Jesus in the Torah, I want to kind of rapid fire through some of the first few passages here and look for ways that we can see Jesus, then I want to finish this morning talking more about a big picture thing. So it starts in Deuteronomy 21:10 which begins ""When you go."" Ki Tetze means ""When you go."" (JR read Verses 10-14.) So what's the deal here? We could spend a lot of time on these, but this will be more of a rapid fire discussion. One of the things here that God is telling the Israelites is 'Look, you're not going to be like the rest of the nations.' What was typical in war was to go in and invade a nation, destroy the nation, rape and mistreat the women, taking advantage and abusing them, but God says 'No, that's not who you're going to be—as my people, that's not how you're going to treat them. If you see someone you want, you bring her into your home and you take care of her; you let her mourn her loss and then you take her to be your wife.' Now, how do we see Jesus in this? Israel would be different than other nations but how do we see Jesus in this? We see Jesus in this as the world in rebellion against God. God sends His Son to conquer—as He comes to conquer, He looks upon those who are in rebellion against Him and He sees people who He thinks are beautiful. He sees people who He thinks are beautiful and He reaches out to take them to bring them into His home to embrace them and to love them. He is the picture of a conquering warrior who treats His bride with respect. 
 
We're going to the next portion because we are rapidly firing. This next portion is the rights of the firstborn. (JR begins reading Deuteronomy 21:15, pausing afterwards saying: Who do you think this is in reference to?) In our Torah study, I don't think there is any question as to why these things are written in here because this goes back to Jacob and his wives, Leah and Rachel. (JR continues reading with Verse 16, saying 'which is what happened in the case of Jacob.) He favored Joseph. (JR continued by reading Verse 17.) How do we see Jesus in this? There are multiple places we see Jesus in this but Colossians 1:15 says that ""Jesus is the firstborn of all creation."" Hebrews 1:2 says 'Jesus is God's Son and He is apparent heir to all things and because Jesus is God's firstborn there are great things that come along with that.' He has an inheritance through that by which to share with His bride.
 
Now we'll go to the next section. When I was in youth ministry, I would get parents asking me about this—the rebellious son. (JR read Deuteronomy 21:18-21.) I would have parents come to me and ask, 'Are the gates of the church the same thing? Could we bring our son to the elders of the church or the gates of the church and be on with this ceremony?' The sages record and teach that there has never been a record of this command ever actually being carried out—that it was given there for a warning—they had the ability to do it, but did you notice there are 5 things that would qualify the son for the parents to be able to present him to the elders: he had to be stubborn, disobedient, rebellious, a glutton and a drunkard, and if he fit those 5 things, they had the ability to do it but there is no record that they actually did it. It was there for a warning. It was there to teach and to show, not just kids, but even as they got into adulthood, really this is more a picture of a young man who was grown but still under his parents' care and living in their home, at the severity of disobeying God.
 
There are some interesting things that we see in Luke 7. Jesus is talking to the people and the Pharisees were there and some of the Sadducees, I'm sure, and Jesus said this in Verses 33-34. (JR read it.) Did you notice what He said there? He said, 'I come in celebration and I provide wine at the wedding. I go to the parties with people and I'm there with them' and Jesus was not a drunkard or a glutton, but what did they accuse Him of being?—a glutton and a drunkard and what was the reason why they said that?—because they go back to Deuteronomy 21 and 'if we can prove that He is these things, and incrementally go through the list of 5 things, then we have the right to stone Jesus.' But Jesus is pointing out how they selectively pick and choose, which is very indicative of the church today, I believe, how we pick and choose what Scriptures we want to use selectively, splicing and cutting and what does He say? Well, He says, 'John the Baptist came to you doing none of this stuff—he was just out in the desert preaching repentance and John the Baptist had taken a Nazarite vow—he never even drank communion wine or Seder wine and you say he is demonic. I come and I participate in the Seder and I eat with the people and I do the Passover and you say what?—I am a glutton and a drunkard.' You know what I get from those two verses that Jesus spoke?—that complainers are going to complain. There are some people that you will never convince. Jesus said, 'When you go to a town and you teach and people don't accept your teaching, what are you supposed to do?—shake the dust off your feet and your shoes and move on.' How hard is that to hear that Jesus said, 'Don't waste your time with people who will not listen. There are other people who will listen.' You know, I don't care if it's my life in preaching and teaching this way or if you go to coaching. It's obvious two weeks into a season to me which kids are coachable and what kids are going to do it their own way. It is obvious to me. Think about it; if there are two kids that have the same ability and one won't listen and is not coachable and one will—who do you think I'm going to spend my time with and really invest my time in? If he's not coachable now, chances are he's not going to be coachable later—it doesn't mean I'm not going to try and help him—sure, I'm going to try and help him but there comes a point where you have to invest your energies where you are going to get the most product. Jesus taught the same way. It's interesting here when you think about the rebellious son—the rebellious son who they could take to the elders and have stoned, it was the obedient son that eventually gave His life freely to die on a cross in place of the disobedient son. It was the Son of Man, Jesus, who came freely to give His life.
 
Deuteronomy 21:22 (JR read it.) In this passage God is saying, 'It doesn't really matter why someone died'—they might have been the most vile and vicious criminal, but God says, 'Treat their body with respect; get them down off the tree they are hanging on.' This is not a visual of a crucifixion either. In Deuteronomy crucifixion did not exist—back in that time—not Roman crucifixion. This is talking about when the rebellious son is taken out of the city and stoned to death and then they hang him up on a pole so everyone can see him to say 'Look, this is the penalty.' Now it doesn't mean that the Crucifixion of Jesus isn't applicable to this—anyone who is hung on a tree is cursed of God—we see that come into play later, but when it was originally stated here in Deuteronomy 21, that's not what it was talking about. There is supposed to be respect for the body. Why do we have respect for the body? In Roman crucifixion a lot of times they would crucify someone and they would leave them on the pole until the birds ate all the flesh away until the person hanging was just a skeleton. They left them there for a reason—they wanted all to see so when you walked into a city, those crosses may have been aligned for miles—crosses incrementally, because that would send you a message—'if you rebel against us; if you raise your hand against Rome, this is what you have to look forward to.' But God said 'it doesn't matter why they died, their bodies should be honored and treated with respect.' Why?—because we are created in God's image. Because mankind is created in God's image, it should be respected.
 
In Luke 23:50, speaking of Jesus, it says, (JR read Verses 50-56.) Why did Joseph of Arimathea do that? Why was he so aggressive in saying 'Let me have the body; let me get it buried'—because he understood God's Torah. Here was a man hanging on a tree on behalf of the world—He's hanging on a tree; night time is coming and the Torah says to get Him down. We could go through law after law after law and we could see different places where Jesus intersects these things—how His life and how He lived these things out. Let me go back and say one thing: it is interesting, too, that the story I just read to you about Joseph of Arimathea, that the ladies that had spent all that time with Jesus, even upon Jesus' death did not go on Shabbat—you know why?—because Shabbat was Shabbat—they continued to honor the Sabbath. They continued to live like Jesus lived in regards to Torah.
 
This is the big picture thing: the world, we believe, was created by God; we believe God spoke the world into being. We believe that God is not just the Creator but He is also the sustainer of life. We see from Scripture that God made mankind and that mankind raised his hand against God, that in the Garden of Eden was mankind's first rebellion, and from that point in the Garden of Eden, mankind has continued to rebel. We have continued to fight against God; there have been periods of time in the world or portions of the world that have been in revival and have done well in pursuing God, but the overall climate of the world has continued to disintegrate—the first time it disintegrated was in the time of Noah and God said, 'Enough is enough,' and God destroyed mankind. He redeemed mankind through Noah; He saved a segment of the righteous. Noah and his family came out with a fresh start and guess what happened?—it eventually gets bad again. Mankind has a propensity to sin; we are good at it. I've had people tell me, 'I'm not good at anything,' to which I reply, 'Yes, you are; you're good at sin.' That's who we are as people; unfortunately, in our fallen nature and in our fallen world, we are good at that. And someone would say, 'No, I'm not' and I would say, 'yes, you are—you're proud, and that's a sin.' There are so many ways that we are good at it and God is calling us away from that and we've talked over and over about the civil war that Paul says we have going on within us—the sinful nature that wants to reveal itself but the Spirit of God is in there and they are fighting for territory and Paul, himself, said in Romans, 'I see the good that I want to do, but I don't do it and the bad that I don't want to do, that's what I end up doing.' Paul, the Apostle—the great spokesman for God, wrestled with this and he fought with this.
 
In the big picture of life, we see the world and the creation and we see rebellion and then we see back in the time of Abraham that God is going to choose. God is going to choose to bring healing to the world, and the way He is going to choose to bring healing to the world is to select a family out of the world. Some people would say that 'He is playing favorites; why did He pick the Jews?' God doesn't show favoritism; you know what?—if He picked the Indians, then someone else would say He played favorites for them.  He had to pick somebody and that's who He chose. It wasn't my decision—I trust His decision in that. He told Abraham and He made covenant with Abraham and He said, 'through your sons—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and through Jacob's 12 sons, we're going to change the world.'—we, as in 'Me and My Son—we're going to change the world and my Son will be descended through the lineage of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, specifically through the tribe of Judah.' There is, to a degree, that Jesus is through the line of Joseph biologically, too, (which I don't have time to get into) because He fulfills both Messiah Ben-David, son of David who was from Judah and Messiah Ben-Joseph, the suffering son of Joseph who is obviously through Joseph, and God says, 'I'm going to change the world and I'm going to use my Son to do it.'
 
Before He brings His Son, He redeems His people. They were in slavery in bondage in Egypt and God sends the First Redeemer, Moses, into Egypt after he had already been in Egypt and had left Egypt, God sends Moses back into Egypt and He sends him in as a redeemer to bring His people out. He brought His people out and He brought them to Sinai where He gave them Torah, which is what we've been looking at—the instruction from God. Anyone in here who thinks in any way shape or form that God ever gave the Torah to Israel so that they could be good enough to be saved, is totally theologically confused. God never, ever gave the Torah so that Israel could live it and be saved—that was never the purpose of it. The Torah was never intended for them to live to be good enough to be saved. If that was the case, why did He redeem them out of Egypt and then give them the instructions? He did not give them those instructions so that they could be good enough to be saved—that was never the intention. He gave them those instructions so that it was through their way of life and living that through trusting Him that was the connection point. It was whether or not they would trust Him by living things out. Ultimately, in Jesus, who is the Living Torah; He is the Torah of God—He is—I spoke on this a little bit last week that in John 1:1-4 it says ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."" The Torah, the Word of God—Jesus is the Living Word; He is the Word of God fleshed out among mankind. He will ultimately bring the final redemption. He was come into this world to die so that it's not just the Jewish family that receives redemption. He came into the world to die so that all mankind has equal opportunity to come to God. Now I'm a big believer that there is still Jew and Gentile today—in God's scope there is still Jew and Gentile today; the reason why I believe that is because Paul believed it; he taught it and he taught it very clearly. Someone would say to me, 'Well, wait a minute, JR; in Galatians Paul says there is no Jew and no Greek and there's no free man and no slave,'—I've had that passage used at me several times to prove there is no such thing as Jew or Greek, but in that same passage, in the same sentence, it says there is no male and there is no female, so if you are going to use that to argue and say that there is no Jew and there is no Greek by genetics, you have to also agree there is no male and there is no female, so quit arguing about who is using what bathroom. Alright? But this goes back to where I said that we, as Christians, often times selectively pick and choose, then cut and splice, Scriptures, to fit our arguments. Paul speaks constantly about the benefit there is to being Jew; if there is no such thing as a Jew, how could there be a benefit to being a Jew? And in that same passage, he says, 'those people of my race of who I am from the tribe of Benjamin.'
 
Jesus is coming to be the Final Redeemer to take all mankind who trust Him—both Jews and Gentiles—and bring them into His family and the picture that He is giving us in this is of a wedding. In Deuteronomy 22:13 that verse starts out ""If a man takes a wife . . . ."" There is a big section there on weddings and marriage and it starts out that way. Now, the rabbis and sages took that phrase 'If a man takes a wife' and they put it together with the command 'be fruitful and multiply'—a lot of them used it as a mandate that mankind was given a command by God that you must marry; obviously, the Rabbi Jesus, did not interpret that the same way, because He did not take a wife; He did not take a wife. But there are tons of material on this passage here, 'if a man takes a wife'—and so I want to talk for a few minutes about a Jewish wedding.  It is such a big part of the life of a Jew. If you were Jewish and were in the synagogues and you were studying this portion and a rabbi was teaching you, he would spend a lot of time on this—on marriage. So we are going to spend a few minutes as we finish here.
 
A Jewish marriage begins with a betrothal. It begins with a payment to the bride's family by the bridegroom. It's a very Biblical thing; we saw it through the Scriptures—in Genesis 24 when Isaac went to get Rebecca, her father gave her stuff and he gave her father stuff and then Isaac's son Jacob, we see him do the same thing and he goes and agrees to work for a man named Laban for 7 years for his daughter, Rachel. If you remember the story, there is a custom in Judaism—in a Jewish wedding—that when a certain point in the wedding where the groom goes over and lifts the veil of the bride to look and see if she's the right one—guess where that custom comes from? It comes from the story of Jacob and Rachel who wasn't really Rachel—she was actually Leah; he had agreed to work 7 years—that was his betrothal to marry Rachel and then when it wasn't Rachel but actually Leah because Laban had switched the two, then Jacob agreed to pay another betrothal and work another 7 years for Rachel. This was normal within that culture. In Genesis 34 we find the story of Dinah and the Shechemites and same thing—someone from Shechem comes to Dinah's family and said, 'You just name the price and we'll come up with it because I want her to be my bride.'
 
When David wanted to marry Saul's daughter, Michal, Saul said, 'the betrothal for Michal was 100 Philistines.' Saul didn't need stuff; he was the king—what are you going to give him that he doesn't already have?  But who was his oppressor?—the Philistines! He says to David, 'you go get 100 Philistines and Michal is yours.' This is a very common thing within that culture.
 
Two years ago—I've shared this story before, but it's very applicable today—two years ago next month a group of us were in Israel. We had just left the Dead Sea—a great time was had at the Dead Sea—on the northern end of the Dead Sea on our way to Jerusalem, we stopped at a little place along the road—a little gas station oasis for our Coca-Cola refreshments, and it was in that parking lot that my life could have drastically changed. There were two Arab Bedouins with camels and there were people on our trip that were just dying to ride a camel—mature people—my son was driving me crazy to ride a camel and there were others who were curious about this camel thing, so there were two camels and we get off the bus and people were getting on these camels and my 12-year old, Shanna, gets up on this camel and there is this young Arab Bedouin and he's got his eye on this young blonde. She gets up on his camel and he starts walking her around and he comes back and he finds her father and he makes me an offer. He makes me an offer and it was a good offer, too. It was a head-scratcher—I laughingly said 'no,' but our Israeli tour guide told me 'He's dead serious—dead serious.' But I said, 'I don't think that is going to happen,' so he increases his offer. Craig told me he was up to about 100 camels, but also included was going to be donkeys and sheep and I'm trying to think 'how can we get them all on the bus?' Now I will tell you that my son and Craig were in the back of the bus having negotiations on how we could work this deal out because my son didn't have any property but Craig has a little bit, so they were already putting ideas together on how we could make this sale work—not a sale, but a betrothal. Shanna was not quite as humored as the rest of us were, but it's normal. We think it's weird in our culture; we look at it and think it is weird but we adopt other cultures and don't even realize it. When a guy wants to marry a girl and he proposes to her, he gives her what?—a ring or something similar of value. I know it's not the same thing but that's where that idea comes from.
 
In Jewish culture when you went through the betrothal process what happens is the reason why that young Arab Bedouin came to me and made the offer is because the girl doesn't have to have knowledge of it. It's an agreement between the father of the bride and the groom to be—the bridegroom. So they would go and initiate this plan. Now the reason why there is often times this heavy thing paid is this: if I were to lose my daughter out of my house, that's a blow to me, because often times she would be helping me with the sheep; she would be helping me around the house—she brings major value to my household, so if she leaves my household and goes to his household, she's taking her value and putting it in his household so he is going to reimburse me. That's kind of the idea behind all of that. But in a betrothal at a Jewish wedding once that contract was agreed to, they are legally married—they're legally married at that point.
 
Now, go to the New Testament and the story of Joseph and Mary. They hadn't gone through their wedding ceremony yet—they had gone through a betrothal—and once he found out she was pregnant, even though they weren't married yet, but found out she was pregnant, he had it in mind to do what?—divorce her quietly. How could you divorce someone you're not married to?—because the marriage was official at the betrothal.
 
In the Passover Seder, Jesus as He sat with His disciples—you remember if you were at our Passover Seder back at the end of April, you remember we drank several cups of the Passover—one of those cups is the Cup of Betrothal. Jesus raised His cup and said, 'I will not drink of this with you again until I come back and get you. Then I will drink with you again in the Kingdom.' In John 14:1-4 we find this passage. Right before He goes to the cross, He says to His disciples, (JR read the passage.)  That was when one of His disciples said 'We don't know where you're going so how can we know the way?' to which Jesus replied, 'I am the Way, the Truth and the Life; no one comes to the Father except through me.' But the picture of that text ""I am going to prepare a place for you . . ."" is the picture of the bridegroom at a Jewish wedding. You would go and you would find the woman of your dreams, you would make a deal with her father; she becomes your wife—he would leave—typically it was for a full year before the groom would ever see her again and during that time you would go back to your father's home and you would build an addition onto his home.  That was the Jewish life. An addition would be built onto his father's home in whatever town you lived in and then you would go and get your bride and you would bring her to your father's house.
 
Jesus gave the promise of betrothal; Jesus paid a betrothal fee for you—it was His life. It wasn't 100 camels. The betrothal fee that He paid for you was everything! He also left you with a promise. This is pretty interesting to me.  In 2 Corinthians 1:22 Paul says (JR read it.)  Just like you give a ring to the one you want to be engaged to and married to, it's a promise of what is to come. The Apostle Paul says in 2 Corinthians Jesus gives us the Holy Spirit as a deposit—as a betrothal of what is to come. In 2 Corinthians 5:5 it says kind of the same thing. (JR read it.) In Ephesians 1:13-14 it says this including the Gentile church. (JR read those verses.) It is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption.
 
Remember a couple weeks ago, I said the New Testament is not fully engaged yet. We are only partially living under the New Covenant—the New Covenant isn't fully engaged. Paul said in that last text ""the redemption that is to come."" This whole idea of a deposit of the Holy Spirit is guaranteeing something that is going to come; it gives us that picture. The wedding day may be a year later and one of the things they would do in historic Judaism and even in modern day Judaism for the Orthodox—for religious Jews—before they would be married on their wedding day and before they would go through their ceremony, the act of the covenant—before they would go through that, both of them, individually, had to go to the Mikvah. That was a pre-requisite to marriage; that was a pre-requisite to union. The picture we have of baptism which is understood by Paul is this: we go into baptism—we are washed—we come out—we are married. Now in popular theology today sometimes people don't want to accept that. When you go back and you study the context of all of the stuff that was the picture of baptism within the wedding ceremony.
 
When they would come to their wedding day, often the groom would be escorted by witnesses. Back in that time that's the way they would do it. The groomsmen would go get the groom and escort him to the bride. Run with that in your mind as to the way you see the Second Coming of Jesus, that He will be escorted by the angels of Heaven. The Jewish wedding is done under the Chuppah—4 pillars with a big sheet over the top of it—it's pronounced ""whopuh"" and it's a picture like a canopy bed; that's where the canopy basically comes from. I'm sure you have probably seen one with a canopy over the top of it.
I close with this: in Isaiah 4 and this whole idea of the Chuppah and the canopy. (JR read Isaiah 4:2-6.) The picture of the end times that Isaiah gives is that there will come a day when God will restore you to your rightful place in your relationship with Him in Israel on Mount Zion and He will spread His Chuppah over you and at that time you will have gone through the final redemption. You have been redeemed and all the pain and all the agony that you have felt in this world—all the daily struggles—some of you wake up every day with major struggles—I get it; I don't get your struggles but I get that you wake up with struggles every day not knowing how the day will transpire; our hearts are wrenching over what had happened yesterday and things that we can't change and things that we have no control over, but there is a day coming when God will spread His Chuppah over you and He will embrace you and He will wipe away every tear from your eyes—if you trust Him—if you walk with Him—that is His promise to you.  Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Abba, thank you for today. Lord, thank you for the depth of the promise that we have in you. God, I thank you that you desire to spread your Chuppah over us to be our protection—to be our shelter. God, I pray that we would trust you more. Lord, God, I thank you for everything you've given us through Jesus and the pictures you've given of Him through your Word. Lord, I pray that we would understand that your Word is alive—it is living—it is sharp, and it's active. Lord, it can change our lives. May we trust you in that; it can change our lives because Jesus is the Living Word; He is the Living Torah and He gives us life; He gives us hope. Lord, thank you and it's in Jesus' Name, we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",9/18/2016,
"If you live in this world you know there are storms on the horizons; I say that today 15 years to the day after probably the worst thing that's ever happened in our country, at least in this last generation for sure. You know as we come in here today and our minds remember—I mean, anytime for the rest of your life no matter if you're signing a check or writing on a piece of paper and you write September 11, it says something; it's a reminder and it will always be a reminder. When someone says 9/11 you don't have to say anything; it's just a reminder of September 11, 2001, and you know because it was a dreaded day—it's a day that I hope that we will never forget, not just because a lot of good people lost their lives, but it's an opportunity—you know I wouldn't stand here and play the role of God and tell you that God caused it or God made it happen; maybe He did or maybe He didn't—I have no idea and I'm not going to play that role and say that but what I will say is that anytime something like that happens is an opportunity for God to speak. It's an opportunity for God to speak and it should be an ""attention-getter"" to us as to how much evil there is in the world and that we serve a big God, a God who can help us to overcome all of those situations, and I will be forever grateful for all those who have, over the course of 200+ years, given their lives and/or put their lives on the line for me—from the military, law enforcement, fire department, and just everyone who risks themselves so my family can have what they have. But I'm even more indebted to a God who offers us refuge in the midst of so much turmoil in the world in which we live, a God who provides a safe place where no building can fall on me and nothing can separate me from God and His blessings when I cling to Jesus, and for that I am so grateful!  Let's pray.
 
Opening Prayer – Abba Father, thank you—thank you for another day of life. I pray that as we come this morning and open your word, Lord that you would jump off the pages to us. Lord that anytime we study your word it's a day of celebration because you speak and so I pray that we would hear your voice. I pray, Lord, that our nation would hear your voice. Lord, I pray for our citizenship here because we are in a fast track running in a different direction from you and Lord, I pray, that we would halt and that we would reverse course. Lord, even in a lot of our churches there is not much devotion to your word and to righteousness and so Lord, I pray that through your love and your mercy and then through us as we extend that love and that mercy that people will see and hear you and will retreat from the wide path to the narrow path. Lord, thank you for Jesus who gives us that hope and it's in His Name we pray, Amen.
 
Alright, today's Torah portion = Deuteronomy 16:18 – 21:9. This portion is called Shoftim which means judges. There are 3 things I would like to jump into out of this portion—there are actually more than that, but there are 3 that I had planned on doing. There is one that I have written down on my notes; there is one that I kind of have written down on my notes, and there is one that I have kind of, kind of written down on my notes. So I am going to start with the first one that I actually have written down on my notes and we will see how this evolves.
 
I want to start in Deuteronomy 17. If you're new with us here today, or if this is your first time after having not been here in a while, we are going through what's called the Torah—the first 5 books of Moses—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. We're actually almost done; we'll be done in October after having spent an entire year going through the Torah and searching for pictures of Jesus—how do we see Jesus?—how do we see God's redemptive plan in the Torah? So today I want to start in the Torah portion of Shoftim and I want to look at Deuteronomy 17:18 through the end of that chapter. I don't have time to go back and read the previous verses but what Moses is doing here as he stands on the plains of Moab, as they are getting ready to cross the Jordan River into the land that God has promised them. Now Moses knows he is not going so he is giving them a final pep talk and as he's giving them this locker room pep talk, in this portion here, he's giving them information and instructions on the kings of Israel. Once they were to get in the Promised Land, at some point they were going to anoint kings and God says to be sure to 'appoint the one to be king that I tell you,' and there are all kinds of things you could jump into out of this. God wasn't ready to appoint a king but they yelled for a king and got Saul and that didn't work out so well and it wasn't until David came along that things got on track but here are some of the things he says about the king—about the King of Israel and his responsibilities starting in Verse 18, ending with Verse 20. (JR read those verses.) So God tells the kings this; He had already told them other things, but He tells them in that section right there that the Torah, the instruction of God, that Moses had given and that the Levites had written and copied—that the scribes had copied over and over—that the king was actually to make his own copy—that he was to make his own copy—you know it's imperative here to understand the purpose of this—the purpose of this is because God's Word was to be at the forefront of the king's leadership, that he was to lead according to what God says. Notice what it says in the verses that I read. It said that he was 'to write these down so that he would follow carefully all the words of the Law, and not consider himself better than the others, and not to turn to the right or to the left from the Law, but that he would know what God had said and that he would move forward in that knowledge.'  Now the King of Israel was the Messiah of Israel. Any king of Israel was Messiah. Now let me explain that because immediately if I were to hear that word, I would think 'what are you talking about?—Jesus was the Messiah.' But literally the word Messiah means anointed one; Messiah means anointed one. All the kings of Israel were appointed by God and they were anointed—they were the Messiahs—they were the anointed ones of Israel, and they were in that capacity to be a leader. As a matter of fact, it puts into more clarity I think the way that David handled his situation with Saul. David had been anointed to be the next Messiah after Saul; they were alive at the same time. Saul was still alive, and he is still on the throne, but David is next in line. Saul gets jealous and so he spends years trying to kill David—trying to remove David—trying to eliminate David, but what does David say over and over in different times? He said, 'I will not stretch out my hand against the Lord's anointed,' or 'I will not stretch out my hand against the Lord's Messiah; he is appointed by the Lord and I honor that and I will respect that.'
So the King of Israel here in this text was appointed, not just as a governmental leader, but he was to be a spiritual leader.  He was to hold God's Word, God's instruction, the Torah, close to his heart; the responsibility of the king was to lead the Jewish people to the Torah—bring them to the Torah—to bring them to God's Word, because if he brought them to God's Word and they chase that, where do you end up? You end up at God—I mean it's one in the same that when he would bring them to God, he was bringing them to God through what God has written. It is important that we understand that it was the responsibility of the King.
 
Now, last week we looked at the prophets. We looked at what a prophet of God was and we looked at the responsibility of a prophet in Deuteronomy 13 which was a few chapters earlier and I want to rehash that because so much of these things overlap. This is what it says in Deuteronomy 13:1-5. (JR read the first 4 verses.) God says there that there are going to be prophets who come along and they are going to do signs and wonders but 'if following their signs and wonders they teach you and lead you in a direction that is unfamiliar to you, as far as how to follow God, then you should not follow them.'  But what was familiar to them? He defines it—He says, 'the Torah.' 'If what that prophet says conflicts with Torah, with the words I have laid out, then don't pay any attention to him.' But then He also says that 'people will come along—false prophets will come along and they will do signs and wonders to test Israel to see if they will follow the signs and wonders or if they will follow the teaching and the truth.' He says, 'the false prophet—he does signs and wonders, but he teaches false teaching—don't follow him. I will test you with those people to see if you understand no, that is not the truth,' and He says in there, 'to see if you are fully devoted to me and to my Word, and will stick to that.' (JR then read Verse 5.) What He is saying there is just because a guy does signs and wonders—if he is not teaching the truth—what is the indicator of the true prophet?  It is one who follows Torah, who teaches the truth of God. That defined the prophet. Now, you come to the kings in Chapter 17 and it is the same thing; to determine who was a true prophet it is the same thing as determining who is a true king. The responsibility of a king was to teach people back to Torah.
 
Now, last week I concluded this: if you follow traditional, historical Christianity—not all of it, but much of it—in regards to Jesus and the way He handled the Old Testament, you have only one conclusion to make—that He was a false prophet! By God's own definition, He was a false prophet! Historical Christianity, if what they teach is true, in regards to how Jesus handled Torah and the Old Testament and here are some of the things I stated last week that they say: They say that Jesus cancelled Torah, He cancelled the Commandments pertaining to the Jewish people, that He cancelled the dietary Laws, that He cancelled the festivals and the holidays, the Levitical priesthood, He cancelled the sacrifices, He closed down the Temple, He disregarded the Purity Laws, He broke the Sabbath, He ended the Holy Days, He moved Sabbath to Sunday—as a matter of fact, I mentioned last week not a single thing out of Old Testament in conventional, traditional, Christianity did He not break. 
 
Now here we are right back to square one; last week God told that in order to discern whether a prophet was true or not was to whether or not he lived according to the instruction God had given through Moses. It's the same thing with a king. I would attest to you today that if Jesus was all those things that we have been so quick to label Him as, then He is not qualified to be the King of Israel. He is not qualified, and one of the things I was saying last week is that we have been so critical of the Jewish Nation over the years and the Jewish people from a religious perspective about how they have rejected Jesus as the Messiah and we've looked at them and said, 'Look at all the things He did; look at all the signs and wonders that He performed,' but at the same time we tell them that 'He destroyed everything that happened with Moses—everything connected with Moses, He destroyed it all.' And in their own words, God says 'that person is a false prophet.' So we've painted them into this corner that they either have to defy the words that God gave them as a Nation and chase this person who is a false prophet, or we send them to hell. We send them to hell, and I know it's not us, but that is the doctrine that the church teaches, and it's a difficult situation that we've put them in. If it's true that Jesus taught all these things, then He is disqualified from being the Messiah.
 
Now where did Jesus write the Torah? If Jesus is the King—the King was supposed to write the Torah down, but Jesus was the Torah made flesh. Jesus said He is the Word of God—what does the book of John 1:1-4 say? ""In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.""  Jesus is the Word of God made flesh; Jesus is the human copy of Torah. I don't know whether He physically wrote it down or not, but He had it written down—He had it written down all over Him. And that's why when He would teach the Sermon on the Mount, He was teaching about the Torah of God. As a matter of fact, I want to go there; we will look at two different passages out of the Sermon on the Mount this morning. We will start with Matthew 5:17-19 where Jesus says this: Now remember you have to keep in context who He is teaching—He is teaching Jewish people who have spent decades in their individual lifetimes studying Torah—that's what they've studied. Sometimes I think we lose that, as Americans we read God's Word and we read it in an American context like He's talking to us, and He is talking to us on one level but you have to understand there is a context level of who He is talking to at that time. And so here in the Sermon on the Mount, the greatest sermon ever preached, Jesus says this. (JR read Verse 17 and then paused.) Now we have taught in His fulfilling them that He abolished them. That's what traditional Christian thought has been. It has been taught that by fulfilling them, He abolished them and they are no longer active, but Jesus didn't say that; He said, ""I have not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them."" So there is a sense in which He fulfills Torah and the prophets without destroying them. (JR continued reading Verse 18 pausing afterwards.) Now traditional church teaching says that He accomplished it; once He accomplished it He destroyed it, but He said He 'didn't come to destroy it—He did not come to abolish the Torah.' (JR continued reading Verse 19 pausing afterwards.) Now here's where there is a conflict in traditional historical teaching. Traditional historical church teaching tells me that I am living in the Kingdom now—that this is the Kingdom. Well, what did Jesus say? If that is true, He says that 'if anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands of Torah will be called least in the kingdom of heaven,' so in other words if historical Christian teaching is true, this is the kingdom in its fullness right now and I do not believe the Old Testament is applicable and if I have ever told anyone the Old Testament is not applicable, I am the least in the kingdom. I am the least, but Jesus goes on to say this: 'But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.' So on the contrary, if you understand correctly that Jesus was pointing people back to Torah, and that's all we are talking about in Deuteronomy 17 for Him to be the King of Israel He had to point the Jewish people to Torah, not away from it. He pointed them to the Torah. There is nothing that conflicts with the Law of Moses in Jesus' life. As a matter of fact, I could come in here today and even if we weren't talking about this subject and I would ask 'How many of you believe that murder is wrong?'--you would all raise your hands. 'How many of you believe that stealing is wrong?'—you'd all raise your hands, and I could go right down the list. There is only one that you wouldn't raise your hand to. Which one is it?--the Sabbath. We selectively choose which ones to ignore. My point is this; there is nothing that conflicts with Jesus—He taught Sabbath! He taught Shabbat!
 
Now this is a big broad deep subject, but I'm taking us here because I believe that it is still the heart of God. There is nothing wrong with Torah. If you've been in these church discussions over the years, you have met with someone and someone will tell you and get really animated and say, 'Well, no, the Scriptures say that I'm not confined to things written on a tablet of stone, that God has written it in my heart.' I've had preachers tell me that. I've had preachers animatedly tell me, even point their finger at me, and say, 'I am not confined to things written on a tablet of stone. God has written His New Covenant—He has written new life into me and my heart.' And then I conveniently ask him, 'What did you preach last week?' 'Well, I was talking out of Philippians 2.' 'Why did you go to Philippians 2?' 'Well, it's God's Word.' 'I thought you just said God wrote His Word on your heart?' You see the contradiction is this: we often get really animated and say, 'No, that's Old Testament; it was written on stone,' and all we've done is exchange that with something written on parchment. They are both Torah! I said it last week; 66 books of Torah—they're not in conflict with each other. The book of Genesis is just as applicable as the book of Revelation. The book of Joshua is just as applicable as the book of Matthew. The book of 1 Corinthians is just as applicable as the book of Hezekiah. (There was a short pause here as JR waited.) There is no book of Hezekiah, in case you're not sure—that was for Shanna, my daughter, because one day I told her some verse was in Hezekiah—(here there was laughter.) 
 
You see, here's the question:  Is Jesus confused, or are we confused? Jesus is very clear that He did not come to abolish; He did not come to cancel—He comes to fulfill. If we teach that He came to cancel it, who then is confused?  Him or me? Doctrine is important, friends. Some people would say, 'Why do we need to spend so much time on this and why do you make this a main point of interest?'  Because doctrine is important! It is critical and in today's world, even in churches, they will tell you as long as you live a good life and hunger for God and try to do what's right, you're okay, but THAT IS NOT TRUE! That is not Biblical; that is a false doctrine!  Paul says in the New Testament to 'watch your life and your doctrine closely,' because what you believe matters.  You know if someone comes along and teaches that Jesus is an angel and that He and Lucifer are brothers, but Jesus is the Good Angel and you just need to trust the Good Angel and He will take care of you. I am not going to stand here and pronounce judgment on you—I am not God, but I will tell you, that is false teaching! Jesus is not an angel. This long held mindset of people and because we are people, we feel like we should earn it. It's a false doctrine. You cannot earn God's favor. You cannot earn God's favor! We live in that world—many of us grew up in families where we tried to earn the favor of our parents; we tried and tried and tried to earn their favor—to earn their endorsement, and so when God the Father comes along, what's natural? We think 'That's what I have to do; I have to earn it.'
 
Listen, friends, there are some things that God cannot do!  You know I remember, as a child, I was told in Sunday school one time 'God can do anything,' but God cannot do everything. He cannot; He said Himself that God cannot lie. God is confined to His own character. You cannot earn His favor; you know why? Because God does not have the capacity to love you anymore than He already loves you. You can't earn that!  God is not like people. 'Well, if they're nice to me then I will be nice to them.' 'If they are nice to me, then I'll like them.'  God is not shallow like that. There are other things; God cannot learn. That's another thing He can't do; He can't learn because He knows everything! What am I going to teach Him? You know the thing that is freeing about God not having the capacity to learn? Why can I not come freely before Him with my sin? When I confess my sin to Him, He's not going to go—'You did that?'--Because He already knows. How many of you parents in here—you know your children did something but you already knew they did it? What you were wanting is what?—their confession!  You wanted acknowledgement—it didn't matter that you already knew. From your perspective you wanted to see the heart of the child. That's what God wants!  I go into these things because what we believe—MATTERS!  It does matter.
 
Let me jump to another one. There is a teaching today--I really wanted to find a way to work all these things in because these are really cool. There is a Midrash teaching—an old Midrash teaching on Solomon. It's really kind of funny and winds together with this. Solomon was king of Israel; he was the son of David and he had lots of wives—lots and lots of wives. And here is this teaching of Solomon and this is what the sages teach. I believe there is probably a stitch of truth to it, but it is a Midrash teaching. The Midrash is the Old Testament Jewish equivalent to a New Testament parable. Now when we see a parable are we to think that the parable literally happened the way it did or is it a story and an analogy? It is a story and an analogy. So this Midrash teaching on Solomon was this: When he went and took his parchment and when he wrote his copy of the Torah—now why would he be doing that?—because he's the King. Right? So he goes and he writes his copy of the Torah, but when he comes to the part where God is talking to him where God says, 'You shall not multiply wives for yourselves or your heart will turn away . . .' it says that he read that differently for himself. Solomon looked at that and said, 'But I'm with God; I walk with God and that doesn't really mean what it says,' and through the course of writing his copy of Torah, he changed one letter. It was the Hebrew letter ""yod""—it's the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet—it looks like an apostrophe in English. He changed one letter of the Torah; instead of reading 'He shall not multiply wives for himself or his heart will turn away,' that one letter changed it to read this: 'I shall multiply for himself wives and his heart will not turn away.'  Now I don't know whether he really did that or not, but this is what the sages and rabbis in years following wrote as a parable to teach a lesson about his life. What actually happened to Solomon? He got lots of wives and what eventually happened to him? His heart did turn away. This is what the Midrash Rabbah says about that situation. It says:
   When God gave the Torah to Israel, He gave both positive and negative commands, and He gave some commandments for a king, as it says: ""The king shall not multiply horses for himself...He shall not multiply wives for himself or else his heart will turn away."" But Solomon arose and studied the reason that God gave this commandment, saying: ""Why did God command, 'He shall not multiply wives for himself?' Was it not just to keep his heart from turning away? Well, I will multiply wives and my heart will not turn away."" {Exodus Rabbah 6:1} 
  At that time, (and this is where it is obviously a Midrash parable,) the yod or that apostrophe letter, for the word that he wrote it in, went up on high and prostrated itself before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said, (Now this is what the yod said to God.) ""Master of the Universe! Didn't you say that no letter shall ever be abolished from the Torah? Behold, Solomon has now arisen and abolished one. (Now listen to the Rabbinic teaching behind this.) The yod goes on to say to God, ""Who knows? Today he has abolished one letter; tomorrow he will abolish another until the whole Torah is nullified!"" The Holy One, blessed be He, replied, ""Solomon and a thousand like him will pass away, but the smallest tittle will not be erased from you, the Torah."" {Exodus Rabbah 6:1}
  ""For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away after other gods."" Rabbi Shim'on bar Yochai said, ""It would have been better for Solomon to clean sewers than to have had this verse written of him."" 
  For this reason did Solomon say of himself (in Ecclesiastes 2:12), ""I turned to consider wisdom, madness, and folly."" What Solomon meant by these words was this: He said, ""Because I tried to be wiser than the Torah and persuaded myself that I knew the intention of the Torah, did this understanding and knowledge turn out to be madness and folly."" {Exodus Rabbah 6:1}
 
You know, obviously a ""letter"" didn't go talk to God, but the principle is true. If Solomon did or if Solomon would or if JR or anyone else would abolish one letter, he would be willing to abolish any of it.  Friends, that is a deep teaching. We know in the book of Revelation He said 'Anyone who changes words or takes away or adds to these things, the curses in this book will be added to him.' Now, be clear—that's not talking about the whole Bible—that's talking about the written letter of Revelation.  But there is some pretty bad stuff in there to have those curses applied to your life for adding or subtracting from it. It is critical that we as people dig. I spoke last week and I said, 'It's scary to me that how incrementally you take just one wrong turn and then another wrong turn and then another wrong one and it might not even be a direct turn; it might just be a Y in the road but eventually you can get way, way, way off course.'
 
Deuteronomy 18:21—this is thought #2 today, but it is a very short thought. (JR read it.) How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the Lord? This is going back and addressing the prophet, after he's addressed the king. Guess what the answer is. Does it lead you to Torah or not? Does it lead you to God's Word or not? Does it lead you to God's love letter to mankind or not? This is our standard. At Arcadia Christian Church, JR's not the standard—thank God! I am not the standard. This is the standard (JR pointed to his Bible.)  We do not have a church-written document listing 'these are the things,'—yes, there are going to be things we believe but it all goes back to here. (Again, JR pointed to his Bible.)  In an Elders' meeting if we have a question about something, and it is a spiritual question, guess where we go? We look to see what God says in His Holy Word. What does God say about the matter?—because JR's opinion does not matter. I mean that. Now, I believe my opinion matters in light of it's been sculpted by Scripture, but my opinion doesn't matter. It needs to be defined in here (pointing to his Bible) as to what God says—in this, is it what He says?
 
Deuteronomy 20:19-20; this is the last thought; this is cool and I think you will like it.  Now this is when they go to war after they have crossed the Jordan River. (JR read it.) Now I told you that you would like this. What?  Well, that's deep. When they go in, they can't cut down the fruit trees, which is kind of obvious, because they will help feed the Israelites, but 'you can cut down any trees that aren't that.'  Let me throw this in there. The rabbis and the sages taught on this text. This text—they taught that these trees represent two kinds of people—people that bear fruit and people who don't bear fruit. Now, let your mind go there for a little bit and think about the Great Rabbi, Jesus and how many times he talked about trees that produce fruit and trees that don't produce fruit. You see the sages and the rabbis had already previously taught this concept. Rabbi Yeshua, Jesus, came along and guess what He did?—He built on this concept that had already been previously taught and engrained on the Jewish mind that trees that bear fruit are good—keep them!  But the trees that don't will be cut down and cast into the fire.
 
In Matthew 3:8, John the Baptist said 'bear fruit in keeping with repentance.' It's the same concept that John the Baptist was teaching. In Luke 13 there was told the parable of the fig tree, not the parable of the fig tree we often think of but this tree was owned by a guy who had a servant taking care of it; the owner kept coming and each year there was no fruit on it so he instructed his servant to 'cut it down and burn it.' But what did the servant say? He said, 'Let me have one more year to fertilize it and dig around it and see if it produces anything and if it doesn't, then next year, I'll cut it down and throw it away.'  That's the heart of God; God's not quick to cut you down if you are a bearer tree. God is patient not wanting anyone to perish.
 
Now I want to go back to that second Sermon on the Mount text, Matthew 7. Jesus had already said 'I am not coming to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it.' Now in Matthew 7:15-20, Jesus says this: (JR read it but paused first to say, ""Now how do they define a false prophet?—by one who doesn't take them to Torah.) Now listen the question is about false prophets and whether they take us back to the Torah and the teaching of the Word of God. Jesus says this: (JR read Verses 21-22.) Jesus is saying what?—there are people who will come and do signs and wonders like it says in Deuteronomy 13, but Jesus will tell them, (JR read Verse 23.)  Because a false prophet is checked against the Word of God.
 
Friends, it is my heart's greatest desire that you study your Bible. It always has been and I hope it always will be. It is so critical that we as people get into the Word. If we get into the Word, we will be safe. We are talking about trees; let me read one more passage of Psalm 1:1-3. (JR read the passage.)  The key to your life in staying connected to God is staying in His Word. That's the key! It's not about hearing a good sermon; it's not about hearing a good Bible school lesson; it's not even as much about a good prayer time and I believe in all those thing for sure—they are Biblical things but the key is to be connected to God. How many of you have received a letter from someone at some time in your life that you've kept and you've re-read, and you've re-read, and you've re-read and you've re-read? Oh, man, I got one in 3rd grade; she was beautiful with dark, long hair; I kept that for about 10 years—her name was Jackie—whew! My heart went pitter-patter. But there are those and then there are those real ones. Right? Third-grade love doesn't really last. Then there are those other relationships you have—spouse, parent—we cherish those things. God gave you His Word because He loves you. These are His words of hope—that you have hope through His Son, Jesus, who died on a cross so that you might live in His righteousness, because you can't earn it!  But you can stand in His righteousness. When God sees you, when you go before Him in judgment, He is not going to see all your mess—all your puke of your life. When you're covered in the righteousness of Jesus, He sees Jesus. That, my friends, is a love letter. Let's pray.
Closing Prayer – God, thank you for loving us with the great intensity that you do. God, you are so good. God, I thank you for your Word and for its depth. I pray that we take our time with you seriously, and I know it's hard because the Bible is an intimidating book—at least for me, because there are so many things I don't know and I don't understand and sometimes we use that as an excuse to give up but Lord, help us to understand that as people—physical beings, that we don't eat all of our meals for an entire year in one day. We don't even eat all of our meals for an entire day in one setting, but Lord, we spread it out in small portions. Lord, I pray that we would understand that if we just get into your Word and take it in small portions over the course of a lifetime, we'll grow and you will teach us. God, help us to understand there are people out there who are offering all kinds of teaching and we need to check everything against your Word, Lord. It scares me to think that through our church teaching that we may have disqualified Jesus as a prophet—against your Word. We disqualified Him as a King, against your Word, so Lord, either you were confused or we are confused. Lord, I pray that we dive and we dive deep and that we look to see your truth. Lord, I pray that your Spirit teaches us. God, I thank you so much for this day and I pray that if there is anyone in here today that needs to make a decision to join your family, to surrender to old life, to be born again, to take you as their Father—to surrender to you as Lord and Savior and those are two entirely different things—if there is someone here today who needs to do that, I pray you will give them the courage to respond. In the Name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",9/11/2016,
"It is Labor Day weekend, one of the 5 lowest attended Sundays of the year. We have 3 baptisms at the beginning of 2nd service today and two of them are teenagers who seemed to be a little nervous doing this in front of y'all so I told them, ""Hey, it's Labor Day weekend; there won't be that many to make you nervous."" Next week and the following Sunday, September 11 and 18, is the special offering for Derek and Kristen Duvall as they travel to Salt Lake City, UT, to start the Awakened City Church there. We appreciate your financial support and your prayers in that and I know that Derek and Kristen and the other ones that are going really appreciate that also.
 
Okay, you thought you had gotten past it but you haven't. Ryan Lochte—yes, I'm going to go there for just a minute. When you think of him right now, and you hear his name, you probably think differently than you did 3 weeks ago. When we hear that name now, the first thing you think is, because it's so fresh, is scandal. You know, it's been all over the news—in the last few days of the Olympics, that is all they seemed to talk about, and the fact that he is a world-class swimmer, kind of took a back seat. It was this whole thing of him going with some friends and spending a whole night out on the town in Rio involving alcohol, distorting another person's decision-making and he did some stupid things and because of that, it cost him literally millions of dollars. The sponsors that had supported him up to that point said what?—that does not represent us. It's the whole idea of misrepresentation. We don't want our names connected to that. Tiger Woods went through the same thing about 7 years ago. He went through the same thing and his actions cost him millions of dollars because of misrepresentation of people saying, 'that's not who we are and we don't want people to associate us with that.'
 
When I was in youth ministry, it was really, really, really important to me when we went into restaurants as students and I'm sure they got tired of hearing it because I would lecture about it ad nauseum. I would tell them, 'when you go in here, understand that it's not just about you but that you represent something that is much bigger than you that when we go into a restaurant and you go to the salad bar and raid it but you didn't pay for the salad bar, it's a reflection on something much bigger than you. If you go get all the sunflower seeds out of the salad bar and take a straw and blow them as projectiles shooting them across the room,'--it's unbelievable what teenagers think of to do—I mean you don't have to make the spit wads, you just use sunflower seeds and project them as missiles, 'but somebody has to clean that up and the thing is that when you do that stuff and people look out in the parking lot and see on the side of that van it says Arcadia Christian Church, it's a misrepresentation of who we want to be.' But even beyond that, I would tell them, 'You represent me; you represent the Church; but even beyond that, you represent Jesus.' Oh, that's what a Christian is—a Christian comes in and steals from the salad bar. Oh, that's what a Christian is—a Christian comes in, destroys the place, makes a mess, and leaves it for somebody else to clean it up. It is misrepresentation. It doesn't always have to be associated with a church.  Each year in basketball we'll stop 2 or 3 times and we'll go in after our freshman games into places and before they go in, they get the Coach Moffatt speech. 'Look, you represent Hamilton Heights and you represent me and if you can't handle going in and doing the right thing, cleaning up your table, throwing away your trash, then we won't stop and eat.' It's misrepresentation. When we would go to hotels on youth trips when I was in youth ministry, I would tell them straight up, 'If you are going to stay up in your hotel room and you're going to get loud and keep people next door to you awake,' I told them, 'If I go to the front desk in the morning to check out and there have been complaints about you keeping people up next door to you, you will pay for their room, because it is theft. If they paid to have a night's sleep and you keep them awake all night, you are stealing from them.' I know for a teenager, sometimes they have a hard time—even adults have a hard time understanding and grasping that concept, but again Arcadia Christian Church on the side of that van—more than that Christ, on the side of that van—that is who we represent.
 
Have you ever been misrepresented? Have you personally ever been misrepresented and how does that feel? Over the course of the years, I have been misrepresented many times as a preacher, teacher, coach—you wouldn't believe some of the things people have said in the community to me where they said, 'Oh, I heard that you said this or that,' and I replied, 'Oh, I don't think I ever really said that.' Actually it happened not too long ago; I was sitting talking with somebody and they told me what I had said and I said, 'No, that's not what I said; go back and listen to the podcast,' and they told me later, 'Indeed that is not what you said.'  But we get misrepresented and when we do get misrepresented it bothers us; when somebody paints a picture of something we either said or did or believe that is not accurate, we don't like it.
 
Misrepresentation happens all the time. What about the rabbis of Israel? When we think about the sages and the rabbis of Israel, often times because of our church history, the first thing we think is they are haters of God—the Pharisees—they hate God; they were anti-God; they warred against God and they shook their fists at God. In my own personal study—in my own personal journey as I've studied and gone back and looked and read their writings, I just found that to be absolutely false. Is there a segment of them that did do that?—sure. Is there a segment of Christendom that has done the same thing?—sure. But I have found that the rabbis and sages of Israel, to a large degree, have been misrepresented. 
 
Listen to this story; I recommend this book to you; it's called Our Hands are Stained with Blood by Michael L. Brown. If you've never read it, I think it should be required reading for every person who calls themselves a Christian. It is a historical book on how the church has interacted with the Nation of Israel. (The following excerpt is from Chapter Four of this book.)
      This is about one of the most famous sages in all of Israel's history—Rabbi Akiva. He was one of the most famous sages of the Talmud; he died a martyr's death in the year 135 so we're talking about 100 years after the death of Jesus. He had made the tragic error of believing that a powerful Jewish general who rose up against Rome was actually the Messiah. But the Roman armies prevailed. The government quickly clamped down on the Jews, severely restricting their religious liberty. When the Romans banned the public teaching of the Law, Akiva refused to comply. He continued to teach in public, not even stopping while in prison. Finally the day for his torture and death arrived. As the sadistic crowds looked on with glee, the executioner began to comb Akiva's 90-year old flesh with iron combs, (peeling it off). But Akiva's mind was on something else. The time had come to recite the Shema, the confession of faith outlawed by Rome, beginning with the words, ""Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one."" So he recited it and smiled. The Roman officer called out, ""Old man, art thou a sorcerer, or dost thou mock at thy sufferings, that thou smilest in the midst of thy pains?"" ""Neither,"" replied Akiva, ""but all my life, when I said the words, 'Thou shalt love the Lord they God with all thy heart and soul and might,' I was saddened, for I thought, when shall I be able to fulfill the command? I have loved God with all my heart and with all my possessions (might), but how to love Him with all my soul (i.e. life) was not assured me. Now that I am giving my life, and that the hour for saying the Shema has come, and my resolution remains firm, should I not laugh?"" And as he spoke those words, his soul departed. 
     This became the pattern for countless Jewish martyrs who would follow in Akiva's steps. They died with the Shema, the Jewish confession of faith, upon their lips. (end of excerpt)
 
That doesn't sound like the rabbis that I would often hear about as a young man—the ones who defy God, the ones who hated God, the ones who shook their fists at God. Now here was a rabbi, misdirected as he might be in where he held Jesus—here was a rabbi that counted it a privilege to offer literally his flesh as an offering to God. The Christians that I've met over the years that have mocked the rabbis and the sages of Israel—I wonder how many of us would have that same courage—would have that same focus—would have that same steadfastness to be focused in the midst of persecution and say, 'I'm offering to God everything I've got and I count it a joy and a privilege.' Yes, I've found that the rabbis have often been misrepresented.
 
As I was thinking about that and as I was looking at this week's Torah portion, I was asking the question in my mind about representation and about the portrayal and I had to ask myself the question 'Have we as Christians represented and/or portrayed Jesus accurately?' Is the Jesus that we live out today; is the Jesus that we talk about today; is the Jesus that we teach about today—if the 12 apostles of Jesus who lived with Him, who walked with Him, who talked with Him, who ate with Him, who did life with Him every day--if they were mysteriously transferred back to this day and this moment and they were to hear us talk about the Jesus that we serve, would they recognize Him? I found that to be a heavy question this week as I wrestled with that. I wrestled with that whole idea of how accurate would it be as I went over and over it in my mind trying to think about time-warping ourselves back to the day of Jesus and to be able to as a church and as a congregation walk with Him even for one week and listen to Him, and look at Him, and hear Him. It scares me honestly to think about sometimes how misdirected we get. I've mentioned the last few weeks about how there are some segments of Christianity who have dumb-downed Christianity to the point that all you have to do is acknowledge God and you are saved—once saved, always saved, and you can do whatever you want afterwards. Do you think if the disciples heard that message preached—if the apostles heard that message preached, that it would be anything remotely close to the Jesus that they walked with?
 
You know to be an ambassador of Jesus, to be a representative of Jesus in the world, comes with heavy responsibility—very heavy responsibility. I've often found that misrepresentation is often times related to a lack of knowledge. Many times when someone has said to me, 'Oh, yeah, we heard you were teaching this or you were saying that or these are your views on this,' it's because the person who was saying it to them to begin with had a lack of knowledge and then the person who is relaying it to me had a lack of knowledge. Therefore, it is critical when we walk in the world and we live as a representation of Jesus, it is important—it is critical that we have knowledge. Learning should be at the core—a core value; that is what a disciple in the time of Jesus was; he was a life-learner. They were committed to being able to regurgitate and being able to tell the story of Jesus, to being able to speak His words because of the knowledge that they had about Him. It's been said over and over through the years that you are the only Jesus that some people will ever see. You are the only Jesus that some people will ever see and if that is true, those people that see you and you are the only Jesus they ever see—the only representation of Him, who is it that they really see? Do they see the Messiah of God? Do they see the image of the Living God? It comes with a heavy responsibility. It is critical—it is vital that we represent Jesus for who He was—for who He is!
 
Conventional Judaism believes, and this will shock some people; conventional Judaism believes that Jesus existed. They believe that Jesus existed and that He existed in the late Second Temple era—the Temple of Herod—they believe that He existed during that time. They actually believe that Jesus did miracles and signs and wonders; you'll find this in many, many Jewish historical writings including the Talmud. They believe that Jesus was arrested by the Sanhedrin; they believe that Jesus was crucified. We find in the Talmud that they believe that there were miracles done in Jesus' Name and that there were actual healings that were done in Jesus' Name. What many of them don't believe or acknowledge is that He was Jewish. So there is a big difference there. They actually believe that He was a prophet—a false prophet—but they believe that He was a prophet. And let me say it again—a false prophet! That's what they believe about Jesus. Now think about that for a minute. They believe that He came and He did miracles and signs and wonders; they believe that there were miracles done in His Name, including healings, but yet they believe He was a false prophet. That's kind of an odd thing! How do they come to that conclusion? How today would a conventional Jew come to the conclusion that those things were accurate in Jesus' life and attributed to Him?--this whole thing of signs and wonders is a big deal. We know in the Old Testament—in this Torah we have been studying we know that God gave Moses a staff so that he could do what?—so that he could do signs and wonders. God gave him a staff so things would happen through him. What is the purpose of those things happening?—it is to authenticate who it was that Moses was. Now how do they get there? How do we come to this point in today's world that Jews would believe those things but yet, and I've had many people ask me this, and I've stated it from up here: how can you go through the Torah; how can you go through these things and not believe that Jesus was the promised Messiah? How can you go through that story of Joseph—remember, how many of you had your minds absolutely turned inside out at the story of Joseph in the last several chapters of the book of Genesis at how many things in Joseph's life exactly mirror the life of Jesus—there are over 100 characteristics! I had people every week when we were talking about that come to me saying, 'That is mind blowing!' And the story of Moses goes even to a higher level and in a deeper spiritual level of those same things, and we sit and we say, 'How could they not believe; how could there be a disconnect?—how could you be a Jew in today's world—in today's culture—and not get that?—especially in light of the fact that you believe that Jesus lived, and that He did miracles, signs and wonders, and we don't understand. It is a hard and complex issue. It is a heavy thing and there are acts of God that are involved in this, as far as blindness and things go. But I would attest to you that one of the reasons Jews struggle so much today is because of the misrepresentation of Jesus given to them by the church. 
 
Now today is heavy. Today is some heavy, heavy stuff. I don't have time to go through all of the stuff but I will go back to the beginning—to the early years of John Chrysostom. Actually the word ""Chrysostom"" literally means golden-mouthed. He was known as one of the most eloquent preachers of truth and love; he lived not long after Jesus. This man was esteemed as one of the greatest of the ""Church Fathers"" from the beginning. He was known for his compassion, his sensitivity and gentleness but listen to what he said about the Jews:
     ""The synagogue is worse than a brothel . . .it is the den of scoundrels and the repair of wild beasts . . .the temple of demons devoted to idolatrous cults . . . the refuge of brigands and debauchees, and the cavern of devils. It is a criminal assembly of Jews . . . a place of meeting for the assassins of Christ . . . a house worse than a drinking shop . . . a den of thieves; a house of ill fame, a dwelling of iniquity, the refuge of devils, a gulf and abyss of perdition. As for the Jewish people themselves, Chrysostom commented, ""I would say the same things about their souls."" As for me, I hate the synagogue . . . I hate the Jews for the same reason.""
 
That was spoken by one of the early church fathers. I will tell you friends, that is a long ways from the man who hung on a cross with the words ""Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"" upon His lips. That is a misrepresentation of the heart of the Savior. Paul, the apostle, said in Romans that he wished for himself to be cursed in place of his own race—his own brethren—he specifically stated that; you can go read it in Romans 9, 10, or 11—I don't remember which one. He says 'I wish for myself to be a curse that none of them would perish.' That's what the Jewish Apostle Paul said. And I repeat what John Chrysostom said is a long ways from the cross.
 
During the middle ages, the church thought it was a good idea to kidnap Jewish children, take them and forcefully baptize them so that they could be saved from hell and torment; then that way they were no longer Jewish but that they were then Christians. During that same time, the church thought it good to take Jews and publicly beat them during their Easter Celebrations because after all it was the Jews that killed Jesus so that seemed to be a good thing for them to do for Easter Celebration. It was because there was a well-known Holocaust historian who said this: 'Christian missionaries said this about the Jew;' they said 'You have no right to live among us as Jews.' I'm talking about with their Judaic beliefs—with their Orthodox Judaism—'You have no right to live among us as Jews,' and that statement escalated to the secular leaders saying 'You have no right to live among us,' and that then led to the Nazi leaders who said, 'You have no right to live.' And there are several historians who trace the Holocaust back to the attitudes and the seeds that were planted in anti-Semitism through the church and the early church fathers.
 
But what have we taught? What were those things? What were those things that were taught that people held to? What has the church traditionally taught? It's traditionally taught separation of everything Jewish. They taught this about Jesus: we've taught that Jesus performed signs and wonders, just like they believed. We taught that Jesus performed signs and wonders and we've taught that Jesus cancels the Torah and that Jesus cancels the commandments pertaining to the Jewish people making them null and void. We've taught that Jesus cancels the dietary laws—that He cancelled the festivals and holidays—that He cancelled the Levitical priesthood—He cancelled the sacrifices and closed down the Temple—that He disregards the purity laws—that He breaks the Sabbath—that Jesus ended the Holy Days and moved the Sabbath to Sunday. As a matter of fact, if you go through it, you won't find one thing that was left. The church has traditionally taught that God was going to destroy the Tablets of Stone and write upon our hearts a New Covenant—a New Law—a New Torah and we would live by this, but we don't even really believe that—that it's just written on our hearts. We don't really believe that it's written on our hearts because whenever we go to study God, we don't go to prayer and just what's on our hearts, we go to what?—we go to a written, copied document that someone wrote down. We're not even consistent in the things that we say in the misrepresentation in which we give. The same man that hung on the cross and said, 'Father, forgive them for they know not what they do,'—He esteemed Judaism. He was deeply moved by the synagogue as were the apostles after Him. I would attest to you that down through the ages through 18 centuries of ruthless bloody persecution and bigotry, all in the name of Jesus, this is a big reason why Jews today will not accept because when you talk to them about Jesus, that's who they see. When you talk to them about Jesus, they see the person that the church has painted this picture of and that person the church has painted a picture of is not the Jesus of the New Testament that said, 'I came for the lost sheep of Israel.' Our attitudes toward the Jews, and I get this question a lot of 'Why do you talk so much about this? Why do you as a teacher talk about this?' Because the Bible talks about it—that's why! If we're going to be a 66-book of the Bible church, the Bible talks about it. We're not going to be a 27-book of the Bible church. For those of you who don't know the numbers, that's the New Testament. And most New Testament churches aren't even a 27-book church—they are 26 at best, because the one book of prophecy they leave off, which is the last one.
 
Now for our Torah portion--Deuteronomy 13. The Torah portion this week is Re'eh, meaning behold or see. Re'eh is Deuteronomy 11:26 through 16:17 but today we are only going to look at the first 4 verses of Chapter 13. As we look at these first 4 verses of Chapter 13 I want you to keep in strong mind the things that I just talked to you about. Moses says this: (JR started reading but paused after Verse 2.) In other words here is someone that comes along and he is doing signs and wonders; he's doing great things but all of a sudden his teaching goes to something totally foreign and says 'You need to worship something you've never heard or seen before.' (JR continued reading Verses 3-4.) My friends, what is a Jew to do? Listen, we have painted this picture of this prophet who has done signs and wonders and He's come along and by the way, He has cancelled the Torah; He has cancelled the Commandments; He has cancelled the dietary laws and cancelled the festivals and holidays, the Levitical priesthood, the sacrifices; He's closed down the Temple; He disregards the Purity Law; He broke the Sabbath and He ended the Holy Days—He moved the Sabbath to Sunday—not a single thing that is familiar to Judaism—He destroyed it all! He destroyed it all—everything! But what did Moses say? What did God say through Moses? He said, 'If someone comes along that has performed signs and wonders but leads you away from the commands, which leads you away from the Torah, which leads you away from the teachings, DO NOT BELIEVE HIM!  They are bound by God in the Torah to not believe signs and wonders if it is not consistent with the teaching of the Word. 
 
So this is what we're left with—that God is this ruthless person that says to the Jews this: 'Don't believe them if everything they say isn't consistent with what I've told you no matter if they come with signs and wonders,' and then He sends Jesus as the Redeemer who totally destroys everything and talks totally against all of that stuff and now God is going to send them to hell? He said you can't believe them. What it comes back to is it's not the signs and wonders—it comes back to consistency with the truth of God.  So we paint the picture of Jesus as being anti-truth of God. He destroyed all of it.
 
Now I submit to you something different and I've been submitting it for years. I submit to you that the church is wrong. Jesus didn't come to destroy all of those things; as a matter of fact, He argued in the Sermon on the Mount that 'I did not come to destroy these things; I came to fulfill them. I came to live them out—to flesh them out.' I would suggest to you that Jesus is as much a Rabbi today as He was then! This whole thing has become clearer to me in the book of Acts why the Apostle Paul stood and defiantly told them, 'I have not spoken against Moses. You ask anyone who has heard my teaching.' He had been misrepresented. He said in Acts 18-22 in that area 'I have not spoken against Moses.' Why would he be so animated that he has not spoken against Moses?—the reason was is because he would be a false prophet if he did. Jesus never spoke against Moses; Jesus never spoke against the Law—He wrote the Law! Jesus is the One who gave it to us to begin with.
 
My challenge to you and this is a good beginning point right here. I read it 20 years ago probably—changed my life on the way I view some things from church history and let me say this: I'm not bashing the church. I believe their intentions were good; I'm not bashing myself—there are times when my intentions are good but it didn't come out the way I wanted it to. All I'm saying is I don't think that we can follow tradition. We need to follow Scripture! If tradition is consistent with Scripture, then it's cool! If it's not and they conflict, I'm choosing Scripture over tradition. Jesus confronted those things in the Gospels too.
 
This week's Torah portion is large, but I simply ask you the question: What would you do if you were a Jew and if all God's Word is God-breathed and is perfect and God tells you, 'Don't believe someone based on signs and wonders if what they teach isn't consistent with what God has said'—if the picture that we have painted of Jesus is this guy who destroyed all of it, what would you do? And I challenge you to dig deeper to see if that's what He really did. Early this week one of my friends and I were talking, and he said this: 'Isn't that exactly what Satan would do? He would want to misrepresent Jesus; he would want to misrepresent Jesus in order to discourage people—in order to take people the wrong direction,' and Jesus said it Himself in Matthew 24:23 + (JR read Matthew 24:23-27.)  Jesus tells us that He told us in other places 'Do not be fooled when people come in My Name claiming these things.' But my fear is because of a lack of knowledge and a lack of education, the church has misrepresented. 
 
Let me ask you this: How many of you would want to sit down and be grilled on Scripture and your knowledge base? How many of you would be uncomfortable with that? I'm raising my hand as well. How many of you would be uncomfortable with that because you know that you've never really poured yourself into it? We've all walked into tests at some point in time in our lives unprepared either because we were just lazy or because we didn't know of a pop quiz that was coming and all of a sudden we get the jitters.  Friends, God has given us His Word!  It is critical that we study. Maybe it's time that the church arises and re-presents Jesus—re-presents—not a Jesus made in our image that we want Him to be, but a Jesus taken out of the pages of Scripture—out of the Jewish pages of Scripture. Let's pray:
 
Closing Prayer – God, please forgive us as the church—the picture we've painted of Jesus has left the Jew no choice but to brand Him a false prophet. By your own word that the picture many times the church has presented of Jesus has given the Jew no choice but to come to the conclusion that Jesus is a false prophet. Lord, help us to get out of our American gentile mindset. Help us to dive and to swim in the depth of your Word. Lord, there's no one who cherished the Torah more than Jesus. Lord, God, those are your words. Lord, we understand, or maybe we don't understand that there is a difference between Jew and Gentile and the way some of these things are lived out. It's hard and it's complex and Lord, so often our hearts are right and I'm so thankful that you see that and that you judge a man's heart, but Lord, I pray that we never just rely on the fact that 'God knows my heart' because you've told us to be disciples and disciples are students who can regurgitate the words of the master, so God, I pray that you change us. I pray that you change our mindsets and I pray that you help us to understand the picture of our family trees and how we are adopted sons and daughters—not 2nd class citizens, but how you have brought us into the family. God, I thank you that no one comes to you except through Jesus—through His blood shed on a cross, through His sacrifice. Lord, I thank you for Eli, Ike, and Amy who will all be baptized during 2nd service and for their understanding that it's time to die to ourselves and to live for you. Lord, Jesus, forgive us of our sin—our sin against you—our attitudes and spirits when they're not right. Lord, create us more into your image that we might truly represent you. It's in the Name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",9/4/2016,
"Last week was great and we had a great day at the golf outing, but I didn't win. I got a text from Brian Kuhn and he said in it, ""I was asking Naomi,"" who is his youngest of four and the only daughter in the family and as sweet as sugar, ""if she had more fun at the golf outing riding with me on the golf cart and driving on my lap, or riding around with Shanna,"" who is my daughter, ""or riding around driving with JR?"" Then he said in the text, ""She didn't want to respond,"" to his question and finally he probed her a little bit and she said, ""JR, because he paid me.""  Oh, I spare no expense when it comes to bribing little kids. I told her, ""Every chauffeur gets tipped, right?"" So since she drove me around on a golf cart, I tipped her.
 
Last Sunday also was a great day as Derek and Kristin Duvall were here from Tennessee. Derek is originally from here and I hope you were here and got to hear them talk about the new church they are going to Salt Lake City, Utah, to plant the Awakened City Church really soon. We shared last week there will be an opportunity to bless them and help them get started—we are really trying to focus on September 11 and 18 for special offerings if you have offerings to give over and above your regular ones just to give them a token of love from this congregation. We want to keep that in front of you. If you did not hear them last week, I would encourage you to go to the podcast and listen to them as they shared their plans—they did a great, great job and it was really cool for me to see a young man—another one—who has come from this congregation that is going out into the world into a very, very, very difficult place in Salt Lake City to try to do what God has called them to do. We are excited about that and hope you will keep that in prayer.
 
Also, we are really proud of our Hamilton Heights football program and some of the things that they have done this past week. I only bring that up—you have probably seen and heard about it on the news, because it's been everywhere.  HH was supposed to play Kokomo this past Friday night at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis but it got cancelled because of the tornadoes in Kokomo on Wednesday, so instead of our football team playing in a game on Friday night, they went to Kokomo and joined their football team and spent a day serving, along with some cheerleaders and adults. But the reason I bring that up today is because our head football coach, Mitch Street, is here in attendance almost every Sunday (2nd service) and our cheerleading coach, Amanda Engle, is also here almost every single week; we just have great people leading the young people of this congregation and community and I say that in here especially because some of you are always in here and not in 2nd service and don't realize that some of those people are here and leading our young people, I believe, in a great direction. They didn't do it in order to get pats on the back or to get on the news and receive accolades, and to me that's what makes it more special because it was done for the right reasons and I appreciate that and want to put that before you.
 
Alright, our Torah portion this week is Ekev, which is Deuteronomy 7:12 through 11:25. I hope that you're doing your weekly readings; I told you last week the book of Deuteronomy and that of Psalms are the two books of the Old Testament that Jesus quoted the most. The book of Deuteronomy is all over the New Testament and there are all kinds of insights into the life of Jesus. The word ""Ekev"" is taken out of the first sentence of the text, as always, and literally it means ""because."" Ekev is because. And this Torah portion starts out with a really strong ""because."" A parent might say, 'You're in trouble, because . . . .'  If a parent says, 'You're grounded because, . . .' because is a strong statement because whatever follows that is the reason for it.  God starts this portion with a strong ""because."" And it is this: it says, (JR read Deuteronomy 7:12, after ""ancestors"" adding Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.) I want to stop there for a minute. I really want to continue on the theme that we looked at last week.
Last week we talked about this whole idea of obedience, and is obedience necessary? I ended last week's message of this whole theme with ""yes, it's necessary,""—because if you're a follower of Jesus, you're obedient, and I went through multiple passages where multiple times Jesus said, ""If you love me, you will obey what I say."" But at the same time, it's not our obedience that gets us into Heaven. It's not by works of righteousness that I have done, but according to His mercy that He saved me. But somewhere these things intersect. I mean, this whole idea—this false Gospel of 'all I need to do is accept Jesus and then I just live however I want, and I'm saved because I accepted Jesus and I believe in Him,'—you know, James challenges that with 'even Satan believes in Jesus and he knows who Jesus is.' Satan knows Jesus better than we do, as far as an intellectual belief goes, Satan believes—he doesn't just believe—he knows, but that doesn't save him. But here we're taken right back in this next portion to ""because"" you do these things: because you're obedient, God is going to bless you. Because you're obedient, God is going to fulfill the things He swore to your forefathers, and I hope as you've gone through the Torah, you've seen how many times God emphasizes that He has sworn an oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their descendants, that God has sworn this to be true. God has sworn these things in the future on His Name and if God swears something by His Name, you can take it to the bank; it's signed, sealed and delivered.
In this portion, it starts out in these first few verses where it says, (JR read Deuteronomy 7:12-15.) I want to stop there and say that this passage gives visions of a future kingdom. The things that we read there, even those of us who have been grafted into the lineage of Abraham Isaac, and Jacob through adoption—us being Gentiles who have accepted Jesus as Messiah and have been engrafted into these promises, have never seen those things fulfilled that I just read, at least not in its fullest. We've experienced it to some degree but He says He will ""bless the fruit of your womb, the crops of your land—your grain, new wine and olive oil, the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land He swore to your ancestors,"" (JR re-read Verses 14-15.) Are those things accurate? As far as everyone who has been engrafted into the family of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—has everyone experienced that? I'll tell you that it's not.  I am here to tell you that for 5 years Leigh Ann and I struggled with fertility—we struggled with infertility, and we were never able to conceive. The very promise there that He gives where He says that within His kingdom that when this time comes, there will be miraculous fertility. We did not experience that, ever; now, I wouldn't go back and change it because God did provide children for us but the premise of the context of this passage is on fertility and about people having their own natural born children. Now, for us, we received God's blessing in a different kind of way as many of you in here have too. That was one thing that was really cool in here last week when Derek and Kristen came; Kristen got me at the door right before they left and she said, ""I just get the feeling that this church is really into adoption."" I said, ""what gave you that idea?' And she said, ""Well, I see a lot of kids running around here that their parents don't exactly match."" And I replied, ""You're really onto something here."" She told us that two of their kids are adopted and so for her, that was a huge, awesome thing. So we see how that is such a blessing—we've experienced it! Look at Adam and L'erin over here—they've experienced it literally going halfway around the world to bring their daughter here and God did that for them in perhaps not a natural way, but literally in a supernatural way in the way they saw it evolve, as so many of us have experienced. But I tell you that because these verses are an insight into a kingdom that is beyond the kingdom even that we experience now because we experience the kingdom with the Messiah—Jesus—now, but it's only partial. Do you think we are free of every disease like the verse says? He said in this kingdom—in this time to come—there will be freedom from every disease. Anybody in here have worries right now in life with someone who is maybe struggling or potentially struggling with disease? Let's see hands in here: anybody in here ever been impacted by cancer? Almost every hand goes up. Does that mean that none of us are believers or none of us are really followers of Jesus because that has impacted our lives? Or does it mean that God didn't really mean what He said when He said He will free us from every disease, or does it mean that that is still some time to come? It's got to mean one of those things. It either means God didn't mean what He said, or it means we're not really connected with God, or it means it is still some time in the future that He will alleviate all of these stresses.
Now I want to take a few things out of the portion I just read.  #1 is that in here He mentioned the fruit of your womb. Speaking to Israel, and I've touched on this a little bit already, but He says 'there will be miraculous fertility' and the Israelites have already experienced this miraculous fertility when they were in the land of Egypt; when they went in the land of Egypt as a group or a family of 70 and came out as 2 – 3 million—you do the math at how many babies women had to have in the time they were in there and how fast that multiplication had to happen. If you go back and read the text, it says the Egyptians tried to snuff it out but they saw that as fast as they tried to snuff it out, God multiplied them even more. God says 'this is again to come in the future. Ultimately the fruit of your womb . . .'--this is a Messianic passage and it's interesting because even the rabbis, who do not believe that Jesus was the Messiah and even the ones who predated Jesus taught that this was a Messianic passage and that in the future you would see this applied—this fruit of the womb, and these things in here applied to the Messiah. Now we can look backward to the Messiah and we can see it. It's interesting that in Luke 1, Mary, the mother of Jesus, who is with child—she goes to visit her Aunt Elizabeth and upon seeing Mary, Elizabeth says, 'Blessed is the fruit of your womb.' Blessed is the fruit of your womb. Why did she say that? Was it just because this Jesus showed up or is it because it goes all the way back to Deuteronomy?—and these verses really pertain to Jesus.
In Isaiah 11 he says 'a shoot will rise up from the stump of Jesse.' In Isaiah 53:2 it says this: (JR read it.)  He is talking about the Messiah saying He grew up before him like a tender shoot, like a root out of parched ground.' It is fascinating to read the teachings of the sages about this whole thing here and again, they weren't promoting Jesus to be the Messiah, but what they equated parched ground to was the womb of a virgin. They equated the womb of a virgin to parched ground because it receives no water and if it receives no water, there will be no produce. When you look at the teachings of the sages, that the womb of a virgin is like parched ground, and then you read Isaiah 53:2 that He will grow up like a root out of parched ground, what a cool picture that is. What a cool picture the sages taught that they didn't even mean to teach concerning the birth of the Messiah.
We know going all the way back to Genesis 3:15 that God said to Satan—(JR read it.) This whole idea of the fruit of the womb being blessed is the picture of Jesus. In Deuteronomy 7:13 we also find this statement: (JR read it.) The fruit of the ground will be blessed—this whole idea of this fertility of the harvest that God would give them miraculous fertility and you take this whole thing back, too, and you can tie it to this whole idea of the womb of the virgin and it being parched ground but yet, God springs forth a harvest. You see in the life of Jesus—He claimed to be the bread of life. The bread of life—bread comes from what?—bread comes from the harvest. He claimed to be the Bread of Life and it's a fascinating thing to me that Jesus defied the natural order of life by being born of a virgin and Jesus defied the natural order of death by rising from the tomb. There really wasn't much about Jesus that was natural, at least in the way we think of natural. We fight like crazy in life just to be normal and I could go a long ways on that—what is normal? But we try really hard to be normal, just so we can function and flow through life so that we don't draw unnecessary amounts of attention to ourselves; a lot of us like to just fly under the radar and as long as there are no waves, life is good. We fight like crazy to be normal, but Jesus was the most abnormal man that every lived.
In Deuteronomy 7:13 it says that He blessed the grain and the wine; not only would He bless the fruit of the womb and the fruit of the ground, but He would bless the grain and the wine. Jesus gave a glimpse into His Kingdom in these 2 things: He gave a glimpse into His Kingdom by the breaking of bread and multiplying of loaves to mass amounts of people. What mass reproduction of the harvest! Jesus was a living picture of that. What about the miraculous production of wine at Cana?—at a wedding—with water! Let's move to Chapter 8.
Deuteronomy 8:1-3 says this: (JR read it emphasizing it contains the same mindset to obedience.) Now I could have easily spent 3 weeks just on those 3 verses because there is a lot here, but in those 3 verses I just want to give you a quick snapshot of some of the Messianic picture in it. Israel has just spent 40 years in the wilderness. These people, as Moses is giving his last pep talk before they are to enter the land—he's a coach in the locker room and he's telling them, 'Look, here are some things you need to know; here are some things you need to reflect back on; here are some things you need to understand for the future—these are the things that are important; if you stick to the game plan, everything will be good.' They had just come out of 40 years in the wilderness—why were they in the wilderness for 40 years? Well, they were in the wilderness for 40 years because they didn't handle the 40 days in Canaan very well. And it wasn't just the 40 days in Canaan—really those 40 days were good, but for whatever reason it didn't resonate with 10 of them. What God was about to do and what they were about to embark upon and what God had in store for their future, 10 of them didn't get it and didn't grasp it or just didn't believe it. Just as they were 40 years in the wilderness because of the 40 days in Canaan, Moses fasted on Mt. Sinai for 40 days. We've read that over the last few weeks because of the area that we are in here—it says Moses went up on Mt. Sinai and fasted and he struggled for Israel for 40 days. He sat up there on Mt. Sinai for 40 days and he pled with God on behalf of the nation of Israel. Fast forward to Matthew 3; Jesus comes down into the Judean wilderness where his cousin, John the Baptist, whose mother had said, ""Blessed is the fruit of your womb,"" to Mary, and John the Baptist is now down in the Judean wilderness on the plains of Moab, where Moses had given the speech we just read in this Torah portion, and he is baptizing. It's at that time that he looks up, sees Jesus, and says, ""Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."" Jesus has come to him to be baptized. So through conversation and dialogue, John takes Jesus down into the Jordan River where Jesus is immersed. Two things happen at Jesus' immersion that I mentioned a couple of weeks ago were that #1 God acknowledges Him as His Son, at His baptism—it says 'They heard in a loud voice ""This is my Son who I love and in whom I am well pleased.""' #2 at His baptism the Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus to give Him a special anointing—a special empowering--at the time of His baptism. But then we go to Matthew 4 and in this chapter it says that 'Jesus is led away into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil' and after fasting for 40 days and 40 nights, He was hungry. Why was it for 40 days and 40 nights? It was 40 days and 40 nights because the Final Redeemer has to be like the First Redeemer. Moses said 'There will come to you a prophet like me.'  He will be like Moses. And the way that Jesus was like Moses and the ways His life mirrored Moses' life is astounding, even to the number of days that he wrestled on behalf of a nation. Now you would say, 'It doesn't say that he wrestled on behalf of a nation—it just says he fasted for 40 days and 40 nights, and that he was tempted—but NO, he wrestled on behalf of a nation because as he was being tempted, it was that all of God's plan hinges on the fact that he stays obedient. Everything hinges upon this—He wrestled in His humanity, in His hunger, in His pain, in His thirst—He wrestled toe to toe with Satan. And Satan says what?—I'm only going to look at the first 4 verses here. Verse 3 says (JR read it.) It's a Messianic indicator. There is a reason why he challenged Him with that. 'If you really are who you say you are, turn these stones to bread.' Now, personally, I have never been tempted to turn stones to bread because it exceeds my ability. I would imagine if I tried to bake, I could turn bread to stone pretty easily. I've made some toast that kind of came out like stones. But then if Jesus did not have this capacity and did not have the ability to do this, it wouldn't be a temptation. It would be 'I can't do that.' But He did have the capacity and Satan says 'If you really are who you say you are, then get on with it.' Let's perform! Let's show the world! But Jesus responds from Deuteronomy. Why?—because the book of Deuteronomy holds power, because it's God's Word! (JR then read Verse 4) which is the portion that we just read in Deuteronomy 8. Jesus is saying that 'man doesn't live on bread alone'—that our importance and what we need exceeds bread. You see when we break it down, God gave me life, and because God gave me life, God gave me breath. God could take away my breath right now in this instant. Now that wouldn't be too exciting to you all or it could be exciting in a not-in-a-good-way. 'How did church go today?—Well, the preacher died right on the stage while he was talking because God took his last breath.' Well, He could take my last breath right now. Man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.
Now, you could take this, as I don't have time, but you could take this and run with this verse. Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. I spoke a couple weeks ago about the authority of the voice of Jesus that His tongue is like a double-edged sword. The Messianic implications of this passage are deep! 
 
Deuteronomy 10:12 is the last one I want to look at in here. It's this whole same thought of obedience. (JR read it.) There is a great debate amongst the sages about 'what does this mean?' What did God mean when He said this because when you break this down God says here to 'fear the Lord, to walk, to love, to serve, to observe,'—He gives all these things but He's never really told them exactly how those things flesh out. And so there has been this wrestling match over 'What does that look like?' You know I get it that this is what He says and we've all been there before. Someone will tell us something and we say, 'Yeah, I hear what you're saying, but I don't understand the practical applications to that and what that really looks like in my life.'
 
Here is a classic passage from the Talmud, and it's talking about this passage. When I read it I kind of just laughed because of a teaching of Jesus, but this is what it says.
   Rabbi Chama son of Rabbi Chanina taught, ""What does it mean, 'You shall walk after the LORD your God?' (Deuteronomy 13:5) Is it really possible for a human being to walk after the Shekinah (the pillar of cloud—the pillar of fire); for has it not been said (in Deuteronomy 4:24), 'For the LORD your God is a consuming fire?' Therefore, it must mean to walk in the ways of the Holy One, blessed be He. Just as He clothes the naked, as it is written (in Genesis 3:21), 'The LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.' So too should you also clothe the naked. The Holy One, blessed be He, visited the sick, as it is written (in Genesis 18:1) that while Abraham was still recovering from circumcision, 'The LORD appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre.' So too should you also visit the sick. The Holy One, blessed be He, comforted mourners, as it is written (in Genesis 25:11), 'After the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac.' So too should you also comfort mourners. The Holy One, blessed be He, buried the dead, as it is written (in Deuteronomy 34:6), 'And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab.' So too should you also bury the dead. Just as the Holy One, blessed be He, is called merciful, so should you be merciful, just as He is called Gracious, so should you be gracious, just as He is called Righteous, so should you be righteous; just as He is called devout, so should you be a devout one. (Sifrei on Deuteronomy 10:12)
 
When I read that all I could think of was if anyone is in prison, go and visit. If anyone is hungry, feed him. If anyone is sick, if anyone is naked—Jesus addressed this very topic in really the very same way that the rabbis had translated it and interpreted it that we need to just be that.
Deuteronomy 7:12—the first verse of this portion says ""because"" you have obeyed.
 
Because you have obeyed, it is in anticipation that you are going to—now did the Israelites always live this out—NO! Have they suffered immensely because of their disobedience—YES! Are they still reliving the wandering in the wilderness today—YES, as they are scattered into the nations.  But is the expectation for us, as Christians—as followers of Jesus—is it still that we should walk in obedience with God—I would attest to you YES! We still have an obligation to obedience! Am I saved by the things that I do?—ABSOLUTELY NOT! But I still have an obligation to obedience. If I say that I love Jesus, my life will take me in that direction. It's a reflection of that. Does it save me?—NO! 
 
But listen to this: Jesus is your ""because,""—He is your ""because."" 'Because you walk in obedience, I will bless you in this way.' Are you perfect?—NO! Is Jesus perfect?—YES! He is your ""because."" This is a snapshot of the future. I will never attain perfection; that's why my works and my actions cannot save me, but I am not saved according to my righteousness—I am clothed and saved according to His righteousness. 
 
Paul tells me in Galatians 3 that if I've been baptized into Jesus, I have clothed myself with Jesus. Here's the question ultimately today. Can you claim Jesus as your ""because?"" When God looks at you, will He see you as perfectly obedient because of your relationship with Jesus? If not, it might be time for a hard evaluation. It might be time to really look at where you are positionally and relationally with Jesus. You don't earn that relationship—you receive—you reach out and you grab it. We are the relationship to where the perfection is one-sided. He's perfect; I'm a failure. He never fails me; I continually fail Him. I don't love Him perfectly, but He loves me perfectly. And when I stand before God, it is not on my own merit. I stand before God because Jesus is my ""because."" Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Lord, we receive your blessings, even the blessings spoken of in Deuteronomy, because of the righteousness of Jesus—because of His atoning death. Lord, you tell us clearly in Scripture that those who love you obey your commands—obey your Torah—they obey your instructions. God, I pray that that would become important in our hearts, not just that we attend church, not just that we even pray, but Lord, that we make it a point to give our lives as a love offering to you, to give our lives as a living sacrifice and that living sacrifice is obedience to your Word. God, we read last week that those who say that they love you but they don't obey what you say, they are liars and they do not live by the truth. God, may we not be guilty of that. Lord, I thank you for the opportunity that we have to be here this morning and I pray your blessing upon us. I pray Lord, that maybe someone here today needs to accept you as their ""because."" In Jesus' Name, we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",8/28/2016,
"I can't begin to tell you how excited I am about Derek and Kristen's adventure they will be experiencing. I am just so excited for Derek and Kristen and their families and I ask that you put this to prayer. On September 11 and September 18, even though you can do it before then, we are going to take up a love offering over those two Sundays to help send them away. We're not doing it today because I want you to take some time to pray about it and how God can use you to encourage them in this venture—in this journey—and in this pursuit. So I am just so excited. 
 
Let me read something to you and it's kind of funny because everything that Derek said are things that we have been talking about for the last month and today, what I've got to share, is almost exactly what he said at one point. In Deuteronomy 20:2-4 I read this two weeks ago. It says (JR read it.)  Two weeks ago when I was talking about that, I was speaking on Phineas and how Moses had sent Phineas and he was a priest—his father at the time was the High Priest—and Phineas would eventually be the High Priest and how Moses had sent Phineas with the soldiers out into the battlefield to speak words of life into them, that he was to go out into the battlefield and the priest was to go along with the soldiers and he was to say to them, 'Do not be afraid; do not be feign hearted; do not be terrified—do not give way to panic before them . . . .' I talked two weeks ago that the role of the priest was to keep the warriors focused, not on the enemy, but on the one that sent them. So many times we get distracted with the enemy. It was David who walked down into the valley against Goliath who was so able to keep focused on the one who sent him rather than being focused upon the giant who stood before him, to where he said, 'You stand before me with spear and a sword, but I come before you in the name of the Lord, God Almighty.' I share that with you and bring that back up today—this whole idea of the priestly role—God has called us to be priests. Peter says 'He has made us to be a kingdom of priests,' that our role is to walk into battle (like we talked about 2 weeks ago) with people and we are to give them words of life. We are to speak words of life; we are to speak words of encouragement—we are to tell them there is a better way and that there is hope, and it's our role. And if we're followers of Jesus, it's not really an option. It's not multiple choice, but it's a calling—it's what God has called us to do.
 
Two weeks ago I shared that message; a 7th grade boy was in here during 2nd service, I believe. I have never met him. He went home after the service and he looked at his mom and said, ""You need to take me to Kokomo."" His grandfather has been literally deathly sick with chronic illness. Family members, for years, have shared with him about his need for Jesus, to which he has held his hand up and resisted.  Daniel tells his mother, ""You need to take me to Kokomo so I can talk to Grandpa."" I'm not sure what her reaction was, but his comment was something along the lines of 'Did you not hear today's sermon? Did you not hear what JR said? I am called to speak words of life into my grandfather.' That afternoon they got into the car and they drove to Kokomo and Monday afternoon around lunchtime, Grandpa was baptized in a bathtub, as he was too sick to go anywhere else, because a 7th grade boy named Daniel heard and moved. He didn't sit and debate it; he didn't sit and talk at lunch about this whole theory of Phineas and the priests going to battle and what a great concept that is—he just did it. The young man led his grandfather to Jesus. 
 
I heard that on Monday—the day after—and when I heard that I was told, 'Right now, Grandfather is being baptized,' and I was dumbfounded; I was absolutely stunned. And I was a little bit jealous of the courage that a young man can have as a 7th grader that I don't think I had and sometimes wonder even if I still have. He heard and he didn't sit and contemplate—he moved! Obedience is a dangerous thing—chasing Jesus is a dangerous thing. Jesus walked into very tough, difficult places. Jesus told us as we have talked about at length that 'If you decide to follow me, you will be persecuted.' The life following Jesus is an adventure and it is difficult because obedience is dangerous, but obedience is also dangerous for the opposition. When we choose to be obedient to Jesus, it's not only dangerous for us because following Jesus puts us in dangerous places, but it also brings danger to the opposition. God moves through obedient people. God moves through obedient people. Derek says, while he was up here, that he tells his students sometimes that if we have been called to something, we must be obedient to the call. It's not an option. If you're truly a follower of Jesus and He calls you to something, it's not an option. Obedience is dangerous to the opposition, as I said, God moves through obedient people. You look at the City of Jericho and that great battle plan that Joshua had which God gave him—'How are we going to take the City of Jericho?' 'Well, we're going to march around it for 7 days and then after a while we're going to blow horns and yell.' Great plan? God moves through obedient people. No matter how ridiculous in the human mind it may have sounded, they shook the walls from their obedience. It was Gideon who God had him trim his army down to 300 people so that they could what?—surround the enemy and shatter some pots and blow some horns and yell, and the Midianites fell. God moves through obedience. It was in the life of Paul that He called out to him and struck him with blindness as Paul was on the road to Damascus; Paul could choose, just like any of the rest of us, and he chose to be obedient, and because of his choice to be obedient, he was the greatest missionary who ever lived, writing at least 13 of the 27 New Testament books. We've talked in here in the past about our family tree and our spiritual heritage and our spiritual family tree—every one of our spiritual family trees traces back to Paul—I have no doubt. He had that kind of impact in the world planting churches all over the known world at that time, and if we could go back and if God could divinely show you your spiritual family tree, it would go back—in all of our lives—to one man who trusted Jesus—to be the Apostle to the Gentiles, ultimately Jesus. It was through His obedience that He destroyed the power of Satan.
Today's Torah portion is called Va'etchanan—Deuteronomy 3:23 – 7:11. I want to look at Deuteronomy 4:1-7. (JR read it.)  The book of Deuteronomy is the book, along with the Psalms, that Jesus quoted the most. It's funny that if Jesus just came to write the New Law that He went back to the Old Law and quoted it over and over and over and you know, when He came toe to toe, face to face, with the devil as the devil tempted Him, where did He go?—to a new teaching?—No, He went back to the ancient teaching. He went back to God's original Torah and He combatted him with that. You see, God has chosen us; He has chosen us as grafted into the line of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—as adopted sons and daughters. This church knows a little bit about adoption; we've got a lot of it. And we know what it means—as far as adoption—we know what it means to become a full heir and what it means to be grafted in—not to replace, but what it means to come along side and be grafted into a family. God had chosen the Nation of Israel and obedience was their life—the passage I just was where God had said, 'I've given you these commands; I've given you this Law; I've given you this direction; I've given you this teaching, and as you observe it—as you are obedient—as you walk forth, you will walk forth in power because the nations of the world will turn and they will look at you and say, 'Who else—what other nation could be like this?' What other people could be like this? And as the Nation of Israel would walk with God, God would use that group of people to turn the world to Him, but what was also true was as their obedience waned, so did their influence. As their obedience waned, so did their influence.
 
Now some people say that the New Testament Church is a ""grace gospel,"" and I don't disagree with that. I don't disagree with that but sometimes we preface that it's a grace gospel as 'I'm saved by grace and I don't need to do anything else. So once I trust Jesus it really doesn't matter what I do with my life because I'm under His care and under His protection. But I'm here to tell you that's not a New Testament teaching, even though we claim that as New Testament Gospel, that is not the New Testament teaching and it certainly wasn't the teaching of Jesus.
 
Jesus, in John 14:15 says this: (JR read it and also the next several noted passages. JR read John 14:21, John 14:23-24, and John 14:31.) Jesus ties obedience to love. (JR then read John 15:1-4.) Jesus teaches there the 'remaining in Me' is obedience. We wonder as believers why we don't have—we claim intellectually that we believe in Jesus but we wonder why there is not power in our lives. It may be because we are not obedient. (JR then read John 15:10 and John 17:6,       1 John 2:3-5, 1 John 3:24 and 1 John 5:3.) And I could go on and on and on and on about ""obedience"" passages. Obedience is dangerous; obedience is critical—if we want to have impact in the world, we have to be obedient. God said to the Israelites, as they're on this journey, that they finished these years in the wilderness and they're getting ready to go into the land that God promised to their fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and He says, 'If you will do these things; if you will be obedient, I will make you a bright light in the world and nations will look at you and not see you, but they will ask, 'Who is this God?'  Friends, as adopted sons and daughters, having been grafted into the Nation of Israel, we are in the same position—we are in the same position. Jesus said in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5:14-16 (JR read the passage.)  God has commissioned the other branch of Israel—the believers—the Gentile believers—the ones who claim Jesus and are chasing Him—Jesus has commissioned us to do the same thing. You are the light of the world! You are the light of the world. Let the world see the things that you do in service to God and the obedience to Him, and He will draw all people to Him.
 
Now, a deeper theological question that I don't have time to pursue today but I want to throw it out there: if the Nation of Israel was discarded by God because of their disobedience, what does that mean for the compromising church of today? I have told you that I believe that Israel is still God's chosen people. God did not discard them because of their disobedience and if He did, what does that mean for us today as the compromising church in the world? Kristen said it—that out of the 2%--that's just the ones who claim to be Christians but how many of those actually are Christians? She made reference to Tennessee that there are a lot of people there who claim to be Christians that don't really walk and live like Christians, but that's different here, because we all know that that's not true in the holy land of Northern Hamilton County and Southern Tipton County. We don't know anyone who makes the proclamation of being a Jesus follower that is not exemplary in their obedience to Him. Am I right? No, my question is this: because the church is so lukewarm and God calls it out in the book of Revelation, does God discard us too and go to Plan 3?   You see, that's what the world does. That's why we have the high divorce rate. In the world, we're always looking for something bigger and for something better; that's not my God—my God is faithful. My God fulfills His promises. When my God says—when Jesus says 'Where I'm going away to prepare a place for you and I will come back and get you and take you to be with me so that you will also be where I am,' I can bank on that! He's not changing His mind. He's not discarding me.
 
Friends, obedience is huge! What is the biggest deterrent to the church in the secular world's eyes? Hypocrisy! Hypocrisy! Why would I want to go be like that?—I can sleep in and be like that. Hypocrisy is destructive! Hypocrisy is destructive to our mission. Obedience is destructive to our opposition. Hypocrisy is destructive to our mission as believers. Obedience is destructive to our opposition and it's not what we do but it's what God does! It's His Spirit!
 
You know what they need to see in Utah?—in the Awaken City Church? They need to see people chasing Jesus, that when they see them, that they look like Jesus. That's what they need to see. They need to go and they need to be obedient in the Salt Lake City area; they need to be obedient and to walk like Jesus and to trust that God will peel back the layers over their eyes and their hearts and allow them to see Him. You see, there is no magical formula that a preacher has or that a missionary has or that the church planner has—there is no magic formula; you have all been in those situations where someone is in crisis and you don't know what to say to him. Well, you know what?—don't put that pressure on yourself because if someone is in crisis, there isn't really anything anyone can say to him that is going to make it all better and they know that! Just be Jesus! 
 
Obedience is what the Salt Lake City area needs; obedience is what the surrounding area of the Arcadia Christian Church needs—obedience can even change the heart of a grandfather who has pushed back for years. It doesn't matter if you are only in 7th grade because you're not the one who is actually doing it—you just follow God and let Him do the work. Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Abba, thank you. Lord, you are so good—so exceedingly good; Lord, I just thank you so much for Derek and Kristen, for TJ and Danielle, and the ones who are moving out to SLC. Lord, I just thank you for their willingness to be obedient; for their willingness to pull up what they see as comfortable and to chase you. God, I thank you for young 7th grade Daniel who would hear what you have to say through your words—through some obscure passage in Deuteronomy or Numbers and that he would trust you in that and go and approach his grandfather and share words of life with him. God, I thank you that you respond; I thank you that you are trustworthy and that you are faithful even when we're not. God, I pray that you would challenge our hearts, our minds and our souls on how we can be better involved and how we can have a bigger impact on the mission, whether it be helping in Utah in some way or whether it be where we work or go to school—oh Lord, we pray that you would challenge us in that and we would hear your voice. God, I pray for Highway 67 this morning and all of our families that are back there. Lord, I pray that you engage fathers with their children and mothers with their kids. Lord, I pray that we trust you and I pray that if there is anyone in here today that needs to trust you in baptism—to die to themselves in their old selves, to be buried and to celebrate your resurrection, Lord, I pray that today might be a day of salvation. Lord, I thank you for everybody that is here and I pray, Lord, there are a lot of concerns on people's hearts—a lot of pain, and I pray that you would be a sweet salve over that pain and that we would know that joy comes in the morning for those who truly trust. In Jesus' Name we pray, Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",8/21/2016,
"Today we begin the last book of the Torah—Devarim—which is the book of Deuteronomy. We are going to look primarily at Chapter 1 this morning. We are going to take some snapshots and kind of walk down through some different things. Today's portion, Devarim, means ""words"" taken out of the first sentence (which the name is always taken out of the first sentence)—it means ""words"" and the setting of this talk is the plains of Moab. You'll see a picture up there on the screen, which is kind of hard to see, even when you're there honestly it's a little bit hard to see. This is a picture from Jericho looking across the Jordan River Valley to the opposite side. You can see a little bit of a dark streak across the screen there—those are the plains of Moab. That is where the Israelites would have been camping. That is where the Israelites' fires would have glimmered at night time in the darkness. If you were someone in Jericho, you would have been looking across the plains and one day all of a sudden look over and what used to be just nothing now has 2 to 3 million people camping. And you've heard the stories over the last 4 decades about how God has taken this people and brought them out of Egypt—how God waged war against the Pharaoh of Egypt and destroyed his army. This is where Chapter 1 is taking place. I want to read here the first 5 verses. (JR read Deuteronomy 1:1-5.)  
 
So I want to start here with ""words""--these words that he is literally reiterating to the Israelites. The rabbis teach on this phrase where it's talking about the ""words."" And on their discussion where Moses is speaking the word, the rabbis teach that the Word of God is living and active—that you can't just hear God's Word one time and get it all—that God's Word is living and active and many of us in here have experienced this. There are certain things in the Scriptures we've read—certain stories we have read over and over and over and over and over—it seems like we know them forwards and backwards and all of a sudden one day a light bulb comes on from an insight within those stories that we had never seen before. And that's really what the rabbis push through this whole idea that Moses gets up to reiterate the Word of God, and I say ""reiterate"" because in Verse 5 it says that he ""expounds upon the law."" And literally what that means here is that he's taking it and going to another level; he's going to another level to explain a new depth. He doesn't just go back to what he said in Exodus or in Leviticus, but he goes through the same thing and he adds to it and when I say ""adds to it"" he just adds different insights. What the First Redeemer Moses does as he teaches Torah is exactly what the Final Redeemer Jesus does as He teaches Torah. Jesus was so fluid; He was so exceptional at teaching Torah throughout His life that unless you were familiar with the Torah, you might not even realize that that's what He's doing. Through the books of Matthew and Mark and Luke and John as Jesus teaches, as He expounds upon things, that's what He's doing. He's taking the Torah and the teaching of God and He's doing exactly what the rabbis said about this ""Word"" that is living and active and the New Testament writer of Hebrews tells us what?—that the Word of God is living and active, sharper than any double edged sword. And so what we need to get from this—what we need to glean from this—is that God is repetitious in teaching. But most of the time in His repetition, it's not just repeating the exact same sentence; it's stating the sentence and then restating the sentence adding a snippet to it and then restating that with an added part to it and adding a little bit more and continuing to give us insight into who God is and who He expects us to be. I mean how many of us, if God would totally explain Himself in one chapter of the Bible, could grasp that? I mean how many of us have the ability—as in zero—have the ability to have full comprehension of who God is? So He often gives it to us the way we eat a meal, which is what?—one bite at a time?—often one course at a time.  There have been so many times in life where I've struggled and wrestled over different questions—over different issues in the Bible, and what I've found is that God has taught me more through the journey than He did actually through the answer when I finally got what I thought was the answer. It's in the journey; it's in the process; it's going into the Word and turning over a rock and looking under this rock and finding there's really nothing there but a couple of worms and nothing that I can see that has anything to do with anything, and then go onto the next rock and turning it over and going to the next rock and turning it over and by the time I'm done I've turned over a bunch of rocks and what I thought was empty space, all of a sudden now there are some pictures that are starting to become a little more clear and it's the journey that's good.
 
I remember sitting with Dr. Lewis Foster at lunch, just the two of us, my freshman year at college over in Cincinnati.  Lewis Foster was nothing short of a genius in this world—when he was in middle school, his father was a professor at the college where I attended and when Lewis Foster was in middle school, his father would go away on a trip--Lewis Foster, as a middle schooler would go in to the college classroom and teach his father's Hebrew and Greek classes for him when he was gone. He was one of the original translators of the New International Version. Dr. Lewis Foster had degrees from Princeton, Harvard, Cincinnati Bible College and Seminary and Indiana University and I always thought all 4 of those went together pretty well, but we were sitting there at lunch one day and he said something to me; I was 17 years old at the time and he said to me, ""You know the more I learn about God, the more I realize I don't know. The more I learn about the Bible, the more I realize I don't know."" And I sat there and thought 'that doesn't make any sense,' because the more you know, you obviously know more. But what he was saying ultimately through our conversation, he said, ""For every one question I get answered as I search, there become 10, or 20 or 100 more questions that come up out of that.""
 
The Word of God is living and active. We could hear the Torah over and over and over and over and never, never be able to grasp the depth of it. That's why Jesus, the Messiah, taught Torah and taught it so fervently. In Verse 2 we find that it says that it took 11 days to get from Horeb, or Mt. Sinai, to Kadesh Barnea. What should have been an 11-day trip has taken them 40 years. What should have initially been a quick trip out of Egypt—God brought them to Kadesh Barnea right to the edge of the Promised Land—gave them the opportunity to go—He told them to charge and they said ""no."" What should have been a quick trip ended up to be a long, tedious, hard journey that cost an entire generation of Israeli men soldiers their lives—minus Caleb and Joshua. God said back at the time they rejected the land, He said, ""None of you soldiers of fighting age, will enter the land of Canaan—none of you, except for Caleb and Joshua,"" and when He said that, that should have gotten Moses' attention because at that moment, Moses had not yet been banished. Moses, at that point, hadn't been disobedient to where God said, 'You're not leading them in.' That was just something that came to my mind as I was thinking through this—I was thinking 'Wow, how many times have our parents told us if we walk a certain path, we will end up in a bad place?'  'You're walking in a bad direction--don't go there.' In a sense this could have been God saying, 'Look, Moses, there are going to be some opportunities for you to step to the side and not be in line with where I want,' and you would think he would have been aware of that because only 2 were going in and Moses was not included in that. What should have been a short journey took them 4 decades. There are some who have said in the past that it took 40 days to get Israel out of Egypt but it took 40 years to get Egypt out of Israel—to refine their hearts. The truth is that's not a true statement in my opinion—I've heard that a lot over the years but it's not really accurate because that sin nature—that Egypt, continues to linger in all of us; it continues to try to fight itself to the surface.
 
Paul the Apostle, who walked with Jesus, maybe better than anyone maybe who ever lived, said what?—'I do the things I don't want to do and I don't do the things that I want to do.'  It's a struggle for all humanity. We look at Verse 6—(JR read Verses 6, 7a, and 8a.) Moses is going back and he's starting over and he's beginning to tell them their history and said, 'When you were at Mt. Sinai and God had said, you had sat at that mountain long enough; it's time to break camp; it's time to pack up; it's time to advance; it's time to go.' There are a lot of us who need to hear that message today as we in our own spiritual journeys have stopped at Mt. Sinai and we have been there for a week or a month or a year or 10 years or possibly even 40 or 50 years and we have just sat there. We have just sat there—we have just sat there waiting on the show. We've sat waiting on the show and I use that imagery of ""waiting on the show"" because if you go back to the teaching time when we were teaching on the Torah, back in Exodus 19-20, it was a show—when God descended from the heavens upon Mt. Sinai the Israelites sat in awe of the show. But there are times when God says, 'Look, that's enough; it's time to move on. It's not enough to just sit and view the show. You need to break camp; you need to advance; you need to go.' I have no doubt the Israelites, or at least some of them, would have liked to have just sat there and watched what God was doing at Sinai—maybe for the rest of their lives, because it is the supernatural—it is God interacting with mankind in a way they had not seen—in a way they had not experienced, and these people had experienced a lot coming out of Egypt. But God said, 'Don't be content to linger in the current because the current will eventually get stale—move forward; move—go.'
 
I want to jump forward to Verse 17. Moses, as he is reiterating the law—the whole book of Deuteronomy is kind of Moses' farewell speech. It's kind of his farewell speech and a pep talk before they go into the land because they got the law back in Exodus 20 and they've been wandering for 40 years and now Moses is giving it to them again—he's reiterating it to them—he's telling them of the important things of life and as he's talking about it, he's talking about how he appointed leaders. He talks about how he appointed leaders—how he couldn't handle the job of leading 3 million people by himself, so he divvied it up and portioned it out and how he was to go about that, and in Verse 17 we find something interesting. This is a snapshot of how Jesus spoke into Torah and how Jesus lived out Torah. (JR read Deuteronomy 1:15-18.) ""Do not be afraid of anyone,"" . . . he said. ""Don't show any partiality."" 'If you're going to sit as judge on the court and they bring in a case and there are people sitting before you, pay no attention to who they are. Be fair. It doesn't matter if they're rich or poor; it doesn't matter if they're educated or uneducated; it doesn't matter if they're pretty or not so pretty; it doesn't matter if they're witty or not so witty—show no partiality. Just because a guy comes in and he's a multi, multi, multi billionaire many times over, don't fear him in judgment. Do what's right.'
 
We jump forward to Matthew 22:15, in the life of Jesus. (JR read Verses 15-17.) ""You aren't swayed by others, because you pay no attention to who they are."" They are giving Jesus credit for living out Torah as a teacher, the way you're supposed to live out Torah. Jesus wasn't concerned with someone's title. Jesus wasn't concerned with someone's bank account—Jesus was concerned about the truth of God. Now we can err in that; we can become so crazy about the truth that we forget about people. Do you know what I mean by that? I mean we can become so truthful that we can just bulldoze people and run over them along the way. Now, that doesn't mean that we're not truthful; it just means that we need to be careful in our truth. Peter said, 'Be ready to give the reason for the hope that you have at all times, but do so with gentleness and respect.' Peter said, 'Teach the truth all the time whenever you have opportunity but do so with gentleness and respect.' There is a right way to be truthful. Jesus was focused on truth. As He was focused on truth, He was focused on God and He was focused on people.
 
Let's jump forward to Verses 29 – 33 of Deuteronomy 1. As he's going back and retelling them their story, the first part of Deuteronomy in this Torah portion, he just kind of recaps their journey and their steps. (JR read those verses.)  In Deuteronomy 2:7 it says (JR read it.) Where do we see the heart of Jesus in those statements? Wouldn't it have been easy when they rebelled—when they stood at the edge of the Promised Land and said, 'We will not go,'—wouldn't it have been easy at that point for God to do what Pilate did and just wash His hands?—and say 'Do you know what I've done for you? Do you really know what I've done for you? Do we really need to go back and go through the plagues? Do we really need to go back and go through the confrontation with Pharaoh? Do we need to go back and let me push re-run and let you watch all the times that you were moaning and groaning about your situation in Egypt? Do you not remember how I brought you up out of bondage—how I brought you out of Egypt and through the Red Sea and how I provided you food and water, and now you say you won't go?' But He didn't. God, through this picture, is the Father in the story of the Prodigal Son. In the verses that I just read to you, it says that He went ahead of them into the wilderness to find places for them to camp. Even though they were in rebellion against Him, He still loved them. He still loved them; He still reached out to them; He still provided for them and He still led them (Moses says) with a cloud during the day and with fire by night. You know what that speaks to me?—that speaks to me the story of the Prodigal Son—that no matter what I've done, God's desire is that I come back. God's desire is that I return to where I should be. Sometimes we get caught in the moment of saying 'This is who I am and this is what I've done and He couldn't possibly love me or accept me.' Maybe you couldn't possibly love or accept you, but He can because He's not you. Maybe our own human limitations look at ourselves and say 'I could never be productive because of how I've fallen,' but that's not how God views you. God views you as precious. God views you as the child He made; He had a choice to put your soul in a physical body or not and He chose for you to have life, and He loves you.
 
Now let's go back to the plains of Moab; let's go back to that imagery. Let's go back to Moses standing there on the plains and retelling the story of where they've been, but it's not just a story of where they have been, and although I think that part of the story is really important, he's telling them and reminding them saying, 'Look, you know, the last time you grabbed that hot frying pan on the stove without one of those hand warmer things, you got burned.' History is a good teacher; there are certain things from history we need to remember and we need to tuck those things away so that we don't make the same mistakes. But his story that he tells them isn't just stuck in the past; it's also, 'You've been at this mountain long enough. You've been in this wilderness long enough. It's time to break camp; it's time to advance and it's time to go and to move forward.' Though Moses himself would never step foot in the land, he's still trying to prepare the people.
 
As he talks to them, he gives them 3 major things: #1 He challenges them throughout this book of Deuteronomy to recommit to Torah; to recommit to the teaching of God and to recommit to the Word of God as being living and active. #2 He also challenges them to repent from the sins of their fathers and when I say that 'it's that they to some degree have become your sins and let's not continue this. Let's put an end to this generational sin—this family sin—right now.' Who is going to be the last one in the Jones' and Smith family to go that direction? Who is going to begin a new track? And #3 He also challenges them to live out Torah with a renewed devotion—with a new passion—to passionately pursue God, not just to learn the Word.
 
In 2 Kings 2:1-14 there is a story. It says (JR read the passage.) The place where that happened was on the screen, though you can't see it—Elisha and Elijah went back to the plains of Moab; they went back to the plains—they went back to Jericho—they went back to the Jordan River at Jericho and Elijah took Elisha to the other side—took him over to the plains of Moab and as Elisha started his prophetic ministry, he entered the land just the way Joshua and the children of Israel did at the same place—at the same place.
 
Now flash forward to Matthew 3 and there we have John the Baptist preaching in the Judean wilderness at Bethabara. Guess where Bethabara is along the Jordan River? It's the same place. John the Baptist is in Bethabara on the plains of Moab and he's declaring to the people ""Repent, repent, repent."" What's that mean?—it means 'turn around go the other direction—you are not walking the right direction. You'd better be sure the person you are following is going the right direction because if they are not going the right direction, where will you end up every single time?—the WRONG PLACE!'
And John the Baptist, right there on the plains of Moab, where Moses told the people to repent of the sins of your fathers and push through—it's the same place where Elijah took Elisha and said, 'You're going to go forth in power' and he took his cloak and struck the river and it separated and he would push through; it is in the same place that John the Baptist stood telling the people to repent, and then the Messiah shows up. He looks and he says, 'Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world,' and Jesus says, 'I am here for you to baptize me,' and John is like 'No, no, no—you need to baptize me, not me baptize you.' And Jesus said, 'No, this is what we're doing.' And John went down into the Jordan River with the Son of God at Bethabara on the plains of Moab and Jesus went into the water and when He came up out of the water, two things happened: #1 The Holy Spirit descended upon Him in the form of a dove and #2 He was identified as the Son of God. A voice was heard that said, ""This is my Son whom I love; in Him I am well pleased."" Often times in life, in order to start out on a journey with God, He will take us back to the place we began. He will take us back to the place where we began and He will say, 'Repent and trust me. Repent and trust me.'
 
I spoke several weeks ago on this incident of what Moses was talking about here about their rebellion—of their rebellion—and they're drawing the line in the sand and saying, 'We will not go. We will not go into the land.' And I told you the date—Tisha b'Av—the 9th of Av—the day of the rebellion goes down in history as a cataclysmic day where terrible things have happened in the lives of the Jewish people: the destruction of their first Temple in 586 B.C. by the Babylonians was on Tisha b'Av; the destruction of their second Temple by the Romans in 70 A.D. was on Tisha b'Av; it was as if on this day that they had walked the edge and they had rejected God and said, 'We will not go,' and God replies, 'You want a date to celebrate; you want a date to remember?—I'll give you one you will remember,' and then right down through history on Tisha b'Av—it's a day of dread—today!—August 13-14—today is Tisha b'Av—today!  Today on the Jewish calendar is Tisha b'Av. It started at sundown last night and will end at sundown tonight. It's a day of mourning because they remember the time—they remember the time they came to the edge of the land and God said, ""Go,"" but they said, ""No."" 
 
My prayer for you is that today will not be your Tisha b'Av—that God has said, 'Bust up camp; advance and go.' He's brought you to the edge of the land spiritually; He's paved the way and said, 'I'll fight for you; as soon as you cross over, I'll fight for you just like I did when you were in Egypt.' The question is 'Will you cross?' Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Abba, thank you; thank you for being our daddy; thank you for being the One whose lap we can crawl up into when we have been not-so-good children, when we have sinned—when we have fallen short—when we have been in rebellion, Lord, you still accept us upon your lap when we come with a heart of repentance. Lord, my prayer is that today, though it is Tisha b'Av, a terrible day in Jewish history, Lord, my prayer is that there are great things that will happen in the lives of those of us who are adopted family members and to the line of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Lord, I pray that as you have brought us to the edge of the river—and each of our rivers are different—and Lord, my prayer is that we would be brave, that we would be bold, that we would take heart, that we would not fear those that are in the world, but that we know, Lord, that you march in front of us. Lord, there may be some here today who have never accepted Jesus as their Lord and Savior and Lord, I pray that although the Bible is such an intricate story woven together in a beautiful picture, Lord, I pray that we would never set ourselves apart from that but that we would understand that you want us to be a part of that. Lord, you've written us into your story. Where do we fit will be determined on whether we're willing to go. Lord, thank you for this church family. I thank you for our struggles as well as our victories. I pray, Lord, that you continue to lead us. These things we pray in Jesus' Name, Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",8/14/2016,
"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me!  Really? Whoever thought of that? If it was part of a job, they'd get fired. Anybody in here ever been hurt by words? Huh? Anybody in here who can go back to specific things that were said to you over the course of years that have left deep marks? They have fashioned us; they have formed us. They shouldn't, but they have. Sticks and stones may break our bones and the truth is maybe sometimes we just wish it was just our bones that were broken because words can destroy--words can destroy our spirit; words can destroy our souls at a much deeper level.
 
Many of you have heard this:
Today in school I learned a lot; in chemistry, I learned that no one likes me.
  In English, I learned that I'm disgusting;
  In physics, I learned that I'm a loser,
Today in school I learned that I'm ugly and useless;
  In gym I learned that I'm pathetic and a joke;
  In history I learned that I'm trash;
Today in school I learned that I have no friends;
  In English, I learned that I make people sick;
  At lunch I learned that I sit on my own because I smell;
  In chemistry I learned that no one likes me;
  In biology I learned that I'm fat and stupid;
  In math I learned that I'm trash;
The only thing I didn't learn in school today is why no one ever helps.
 
Words have the ability to destroy! 
 
I found some stories. One young person said this: My mom once told me ""all your dad can talk about lately is what a disappointment you have turned out to be."" She said 'that was the day I decided my mom was not a very nice person.' Another young person said they'd had a conversation with their parents and they had told him that when she got older they didn't think she should have children. She said a week later the mom said, ""Your dad and I talked about our gene pool ending with you and we actually think that's probably a good thing."" Another young lady when she confronted her mother on the fact that she had allowed her to be raped when she was a child, got the response from her mother, ""You deserved it."" A young man heard this from his mom: ""Why are you so ugly? Your dad and I are really good looking; it just doesn't make any sense!"" 
 
And I could go on and on and on. Some of these are the extreme, but I once counseled a kid years and years ago who told me that every night for years before he fell asleep, his dad would come into his bedroom, look at him and in the dark, he knew what his dad was doing—it was the old shaking his head in disgust every night. So where does your life end up after you hear those words? Normally not in a very good place.
 
Today I want to talk a little bit about the power of words. Words have the power to destroy; they have the power to heal, too. The problem with words, though, is that you can take years to build someone up to a place they need to be and it can all be destroyed with a few words in a few seconds. Part of that is because we tend to believe the negative. We tend to gravitate toward that for whatever reason; we listen to the voice of the enemy—we listen to the voice of the adversary—the one who says you are worthless—the one who says you stink—the one who says you are ugly—the one who says you are stupid. We tend to listen to the adversary because that's what he wants us to believe and we tend to NOT listen to the One who created us who says, 'I've made you in my image,' and who says 'you are blessed and you are cherished.'
 
Todays' Torah portion is actually two Torah portions put into one; if you read it this week, it is long. It is Numbers 30:1 through the 36:13 which is the end of the book of Numbers and we're ending that book today. Today is Mattot; it is also combined with Massei. On Jewish leap years this is two portions, but on non-leap years, they combine the two together so today it is longer because it is actually two portions together. Mattot means ""tribes;"" Massei means ""journeys,"" and that's the way we end the book of Numbers with the tribes and their journeys. Today we are going to look a little bit at the beginning of this portion. I want to look at Numbers 31:1-6. (He began reading pausing after Verse 2.) We talked some last week about the fact that Moses had not done what God had told him and therefore Moses was not going to be the one to lead them into the Promised Land. But God wasn't done with Moses, even though he wasn't going to receive the reward for taking them into the Land of Promise, God was still using him. God wasn't done with him; sometimes we mess up and think God will never use me, but that wasn't the case with Moses. Sometimes there are penalties that have to be served, but God is a God of justice and we'll look at that a little bit this morning about how God is a God of justice, but God is also a God of forgiveness and He is still using Moses. (JR continued reading Verses 3-6.) Now there are a few questions that we need to ask here and I will get to the point about where this does speak to the power of words, but the first question that I see that jumps out at me is why the Midianites? Why them and if it's because the Midianites have caused problems for the Israelites then why not the Moabites, too? Because if you've been reading these portions it's the Moabites right now who are currently are a little bit their thorn in the flesh. The Israelites are on Moabite territory and the Moabites have caused them some problems but God said, 'Go and pour out the Lord's vengeance upon the Midianites' and he leaves the Moabites out of it. Well, Scriptures don't really tell us why and it's not specific on why but we can maybe kind of look through and see possibly some of the reasons. The Moabites, for one, might have had cause, so to speak, with the Israelites being on their territory and we're not talking about just 2 dozen people; we're talking about 2 or 3 million people who have invaded their land. I could see how God would say 'They're a little bit uptight because of this hoard of people; I'm going to overlook them,' but I don't necessarily think that's the reason. It's interesting that the sages teach that there is a deeper reason it wasn't the Moabites that he attacked and destroyed, but it was in His divine knowledge God knew that King David would come from the lineage of Ruth, who was a Moabitess and if he would destroy the Moabites, he would have interfered with His plan. I don't know for sure, but to me, that makes more sense in the infinite wisdom of God. But what we do know is that He sent them after the Midianites, and it says, ""so that they may carry out the Lord's vengeance."" You see there are some wars in the Scriptures that are fought which are born of man. They are born of man in that man has decided he is going to go to war, but there are some of the wars in the Scriptures that are of the Lord where God has raised people up and this is where I say that God is a just God and I don't have time to go deep into this today but we need to wrap our minds around and understand that the justice of God is combined with the love of God. God's justice is a display of His love; it's a display of His love for truth; it's a display of His love for integrity and character, and God's justice would be poured out on each of us if we stand without one on our behalf. But it was Jesus who took God's justice, in my life, upon Himself. He died for my sin; my sin that justice calls for my sin to be dealt with. We freak out about things like Casey Anthony, in Florida, who was tried in a court of law for killing her own daughter. I don't know if she did or not, but when she was found 'not guilty' people lost their minds. They said, 'This is not right; justice needs to be served.' There is none so blatant, if you're old enough to remember, than the O. J. Simpson trial and verdict. You probably remember where you were when that verdict came down. I mean, wow, the whole world was saying 'Where is the justice?' And then he goes to prison years later for something else and people were saying, 'Justice is finally served.'  I don't know whether he did it or didn't do it but what I'm talking about is that the human heart says that when there are penalties like that there should be justice and God feels the same way. The problem with the human heart is that we selectively choose the justice on what we think should be penalized—you know those severe cases but God's justice is perfect.
 
Now in this we find that they're sent to war to do battle. Oh, another Bible example of someone fighting a war on behalf of God—a spiritual war—was David when he fought Goliath. If you read the framework of that story, Goliath stood in defiance of the God of Israel; he stood opposed to God and stood at war with God and David said, 'You come at me with a spear and a sword, but I came at you in the Name of the Lord God Almighty.' And so there are times when these things are justified. And for whatever reason, God felt that He was going to send 12,000 against the Midianites so He does and sends Phinehas with them. Remember, Phinehas is the grandson of Aaron; he is the high priest in line—now he's not the current priest—his father, Eleazar, is the current High Priest, but Phinehas is in line so he will be and that's important in this story. It's important that God sends 12,000 soldiers and He sends a priest along with them. Within Jewish history, the rabbis teach this whole idea of the Messiah of Israel who will be a War Messiah; He will be a Messiah who comes to lead the Armies of God to war—to execute, to justice. In Psalm 110 we find the idea that the Messiah is both a warrior and a priest. Listen to this; it says (JR read Verses 1-3.) Do you hear this Warrior Messiah? It says (JR continued reading Verses 4-7.)  The rabbis teach this idea of this war Messiah—this Messiah who will be a warrior—this Messiah who will come to save. This is a Messiah that the disciples expected. ""Lord, is it at this time you're going to restore the kingdom to Israel?"" This is the Messiah that all of Israel was craving when Jesus came to Jerusalem and they paved the road with palm branches and they sang, 'Hosanna, Hosanna, blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,' because they were under bondage from Rome and they knew the Messiah was to come to set them free and they believed that He was that Messiah. And He was Him!  He just wasn't ready for that part of it yet. We know, just like the sages and rabbis teach, that there will be a Warrior Messiah who pours out vengeance but it's interesting as we read in Deuteronomy which we start next week; it will be the last of the 5 books of the Torah portions. In Deuteronomy 20:2-4 it says this: (JR read it.)  Now think about this in context with the story in Numbers. The priest, in this case Phinehas, was to go out with the armies, and in a sense he was the military chaplain. I mean, in a real sense, that's what he did. He was the original military chaplain; he was to go with them and his whole thing was to speak words of encouragement. 'Take heart; do not be afraid; don't get your eyes fixed on that enemy because if you do, you might see Goliath and if you realize how big he is, you might turn and run. But fix your eyes on the one that David says that [you come at me with a spear and a sword, but I come at you in the Name of the Lord Almighty]—the God of Israel.' David was able to keep his eyes focused on the One he was serving—not the one he was fighting. And that was the role of the priest. The role of the priest was to be there and pray over the troops, to encourage the troops and to keep their eyes focused on the right place—to keep them looking in the right direction—to keep their perspective correct. Now we might ask the question, 'Why would Moses send Phinehas?' Why wouldn't Moses go himself? Well, Moses is about to die for one—he's getting up there in age and knows it is close to the end of the line but it's also that he wrote these books and wrote the book of Deuteronomy and he understands the role of the priest so he is delegating responsibility and giving him a chance to lead but there are times when Moses did this; if you think back to Exodus 17 which came earlier in our Torah study we had this story, and I don't think I spent any time talking about this part of that portion, but we have this story about the fight and the battle with the Amalekites and Moses does what?—he presides over the battle. He presides over the battle with his arms lifted high and he stands above the troops as an intercessor in prayer. He stands praying over the troops of Israel and as long as his hands were held high the Israelites won; they were victorious—they were winning the battle—but when his arms would start to sag, the Amalekites would start to win so what does this tell us when things get tough in life? Get some friends!  So Aaron and Hur stood next to Moses and held up his arms and what is the principle there?  Sometimes we can't do it by ourselves, but some of us are so stubborn that we'll try anyway, even though we see our friends losing the battle, rather than ask someone to come in and to help us, we just try to do it ourselves.
 
But Moses gives us this whole idea; earlier in his life of being this intercessor—this high priest—and he served in that role earlier in his ministry. He served the role as the priest over Israel—the go-between Israel and God and he stood over the people. This picture of the priest going to battle is a picture of the First Redeemer, Moses, through prayer. We have the Last Redeemer, Jesus, who will go to war to avenge God through prayer and through the authority of His Word.
Isaiah 11:4 says that He, speaking of the Messiah, which we believe to be Jesus, that ""He will strike the earth with the rod of His mouth, with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked."" And in Psalm 2:9 it says that He ""will break the nations with a rod of iron and dash them to pieces like pottery."" We have this visual over and over and over of the authority of God spoken from the mouth of the Messiah; the Messiah will be a warrior like His father, David—David who fought the giant Goliath—David who led the troops into battle—David who extended the territory of Israel more than any other king in Israel's history. ""Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,""—they said about Jesus, ""The son of David."" He will be a warrior like His father, David; He will extend the territories of His Kingdom, but it's a spiritual war. It's not just a physical war; it's a spiritual war and in Ephesians 6:12 the Apostle Paul tells us our battle is not against flesh and blood; we get so caught up in that in today's world—we get so caught up in that a person is our enemy, but people are not our enemies. People do stupid things and it's the stupid things that people do that are the enemy because those are the battles of evil that are behind the flesh. You know Jesus said, 'don't have fear over the one who can destroy your flesh—who can kill your body; be afraid of the one that can destroy your soul.' We get caught in this fleshly thing—too many Christians live in the flesh world and just live in this world. The Scriptures say this world is not my home; that I am a citizen of Heaven. My world is flesh, but it is more than just the flesh—it's the spirit. This comes out also in the book of Numbers. When Phinehas led the troops, it says that he took along with him 'some of the articles from the sanctuary.' He took the Ark of the Covenant, more than likely, because that represented the presence of God because God told him to go; God told him to fight this war and God will walk with you when He tells you to fight—God will go with you.
 
In 2 Thessalonians 2:8 the Apostle Paul says this: (JR read it.) Jesus will overthrow the lawless one with the breath of His mouth. In Revelation 2:12 we find these words: (JR read it.) He has it right here in His sheath and He pulls it out and He starts to swing it—NO! The writer goes on to tell us where He has the sharp, double-edged sword.  It says it Revelation 1:16 (JR read it.)  It was coming out of His mouth. In Revelation 2:16 it says this: (JR read it.)  In Revelation 19:15, it says (JR read it.) And in Revelation 19:21 it says (JR read it.)  The rider on the white horse—the Messiah; Jesus, He is the Warrior Messiah; He is a Warrior Priest; He is the One who will come to make justice right; all of the injustices, all of the crud; all of the clutter of our lives He will come to make it right if you haven't already dealt with it with Him.
 
Zechariah 14 gives a really strong picture of this Warrior Messiah who comes to fight against the armies of the world, who come and assemble themselves around the mountain there in Jerusalem—Mt. Moriah, and He destroys them with the sword of His mouth. The sword of His mouth there is authority; does it mean that when He comes back and goes to war, He will stick His tongue out and start chopping people? It is literal but it is not a literal sword, but it is a literal authority and comes from a sword and we find it in the life of Jesus. When He walked the earth He walked up to someone who was demon-possessed and the demons said ""Lord, Lord,"" because they knew who He was and He told them with the words of His mouth, ""Leave—depart,"" and they left and the people were astonished and they said, 'Who was this man that even the demons obey His authority?' He was out on a boat with His disciples and He was sleeping. They wake Him up because they are in the middle of a storm. They see a storm—He sees an opportunity; they see a storm in which they could perish, but not Jesus. He sees a place where He can present to them who He is and He stood and He said, 'Be still,' and His disciples on the boat with Him—those who wrote the testimony said they were astonished 'that the waves and the seas obey Him.'
 
A Roman Centurion comes to Jesus and says, 'I am a filthy Roman; you don't need to come to my house; my servant is about to die, but if you just speak the words, he will be healed.' And Jesus said, 'Tarry on; your faith has healed him.' His word has an authority and when He comes back, He will—what does it look like in real life warfare, though? It looks like John 18 when Jesus was in Gethsemane and a band of soldiers come to arrest Him in the Garden of Gethsemane and John the Apostle said as they approached, He steps forward and says, ""Who is it that you are looking for?"" and they responded, ""Jesus of Nazareth,"" to which He responded ""I am He,"" to which they responded by going to their knees; they drew back and fell to the ground. I believe God puts all these things here as a picture for us to understand the authority of the Word of God—that nothing—nothing has been created apart from Jesus—that He is the Creator and even with a word—with one word—He can speak things into being and with a word, He can speak armies into destruction. It's a powerful picture this Warrior Messiah gives us. I encourage you to read and spend some time in Zechariah 14 this week and see how this Warrior Messiah will deal with and bring God's justice to the world. My prayer is that you are on the right side of that justice.
 
In that Garden of Gethsemane when the soldiers fell down, Peter pulls out his sword. Jesus uses the sword of His mouth and Peter pulls out his knife and starts chopping, to which Jesus responds, 'Put your sword away; I've got this. Don't you realize that I can appeal to my Father and He would send legions of angels to serve me?' 'If I appeal to my Father, I'm in prayer and if I am equipped with legions of angels, it's for war.'
 
Our words are powerful; we are priests. Peter tells us that we are a kingdom of priests; we are a kingdom of Phinehas'. We have been put here to be an encouragement to walk through the world, to walk by people and say, 'Look, have courage; have no fear; understand that there is one who is bigger than your problems. Understand there is one who could potentially hold the victory in His Hands.'
 
School starts back up this week for Hamilton Heights; Noblesville has already started; I'm not sure about Tipton—not yet for them. But it is a war zone. And I ask the question, 'What are these children going to learn this week at school?' Is it going to be what I opened with?—that radio commercial spot that we're all too familiar with? Or do we have some Phinehas' that are going to walk alongside people and say 'You matter; you are important.' There are destructive words that are going to be said but the Messiah needs people who will counter balance that, who will keep people focused on hope.
 
I want to go to the Torah portion for just one more thing in closing. At the end of this week's Torah portion you read about these cities of refuge. The cities of refuge—they're kind of a mysterious thing. They were to build 3 of the cities in the Promised Land proper and then they were going to build 3 more of these cities of refuge in the land that they extended to the east side of the Jordan and if you read about these cities of refuge, they were built for a specific reason. If I accidentally killed someone, I could go to a city of refuge and the avenger of blood was not allowed to come and take my life, as long as I stayed in that city of refuge. Now the Scriptures talk specifically and give examples of this accidental death. You stand there and we're chopping wood together and my ax blade flies off, hits you in the head, and you die. I didn't do it on purpose but your brother is coming after me because that is the law of the land. God didn't come up with the avenger of blood thing; what God did was He acted upon human direction because human direction said if we're going to have an avenger of blood to kill people, God stepped into that scene and said, 'This is the way you will deal with this and this is the way you can handle this.' He provided cities of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone because you can go there and you get go through a trial and as long as you're found innocent, you're allowed to live in a city of refuge and the avenger of blood cannot come and take your life. Now if you walk outside the city of refuge?—you're on your own!  The safety of inside the city doesn't apply anymore if you step outside of it, but as long as you stay within the walls of the city of refuge, even though you didn't intentionally do it, God gives you a place where you can live and the Scriptures say that you were to live there until the death of the High Priest who was serving currently in Israel and upon the death of the High Priest you were released to be free.
 
Where do we see Jesus in the Torah? The High Priest came and died so that you don't have to live in a city of refuge; He has set you free! The question is not whether or not He has—the question is whether you accept it. That's where God's Providence interacts with the human heart. God doesn't make you a mechanical robot and tell you every move you have to make; God gives you a beautiful present and says it's all yours, but you have to open it; you have to accept it. That's what we have in Jesus—the High Priest who died to set us free. Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – God, thank you; thank you not just for Jesus who died, but that He was buried and He has risen—Lord, that we serve a Risen Savior who is in the world today. Lord, sometimes it's easy to put our eyes on the adversary and it seems like sometimes we are losing the battle but Lord, by faith, may we trust you. Lord Jesus said 'in this world you will have trouble, but take heart, because I have overcome the world.' Lord, may we be patient and may we live according to your plan. Lord, thank you that we have a Savior. Lord, thank you that Jesus didn't just come to be an accuser, which He very well could have, and He would have been right. Lord, I thank you that you are a just God and I thank you that you will come back and display your love through justice that you will come to judge the world. Lord, I pray that our judgment—each of us personally—was dealt with on a cross—that we have accepted the gift of Jesus and that our sins have been nailed and buried. Lord, thank you for what we have in Jesus and it's in His Name that we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",8/7/2016,
"I hope you were able to stop by sometime this week and check it out; we had a goal for our offering of sponsoring 30 kids in Guatemala and to raise $1,500, but I think they passed that amount on the second or third night and ended up raising about $2,800 which will sponsor 41 or 42 kids. I'm sure all the money isn't in yet because I just put some more in today, so we'll see what happens with that. Also, there was enough of the offering to help purchase a refrigerator for Haiti. So there was a lot of really, really, cool stuff going on and we have a lot of really, really, really tired adults after this week and I'm here to say ""thank you"" for just so much. We might have a little less attendance today because some of our kids didn't get off the time capsule in time when it was taken away. For those of you who weren't here last week, you don't know what I'm talking about, but the entire Wallace Family is gone; I sent them back to the time of Noah. I thought it would be good for those boys to work on that Ark a little while so they should be returning sometime tonight.
 
I do have one matter of serious business that we need to discuss concerning our staff here. Teri Curnutt had her first hole-in-one this week—don't clap—she has only been playing golf about 2 years; how many of you have been playing forever and haven't had a hole-in-one?  That's kind of irritating to me anyway.  But she did so now we have an office assistant hole-in-one, so I'm not sure if I am on speaking terms with her right now or not.
 
Today, as we look at our Torah portion, today is going to be snapshots because there are a bunch of pictures of Jesus in today's Torah portion and we are not going to be spending time on any of those in depth; instead I just want to go through them in snapshot form. Today's Torah portion is called Pinchas; it is Numbers 25:10-29:40. It's a pretty extensive amount of chapters and verses. Pinchas is the name Phinehas. Phinehas was the grandson of Aaron; he was in the lineage of the priests and I want to start in Chapter 25 and I just want to take a look at the story of Phinehas because in the story of Phinehas we have a snapshot of Jesus. Going back to the end of last week's portion, in Chapter 25:3 we find that ""Israel had yoked themselves to the Baal of Peor. And the Lord's anger burned against them."" At the end of last portion, we find that the Israelites, even now, still haven't figured it out. And isn't that the way humanity is? We swear ourselves off of something; I mean we're not going to smoke anymore or we're not going to overeat anymore, or we're not going to use profanity anymore—I mean we make all these proclamations but human weakness often times takes us where?—right back to where we were. We're not going to let anger control us anymore and then something triggers us and we're right back to where we were. And Israel is a lot the same way—the people of Israel—the Nation. God has been dealing with them now for several years. They've been in the wilderness; they've experienced God's blessings—they've experienced God's mercy—they've experienced God's provision. But now it says they ""have yoked themselves to Baal of Peor."" It's a troubling thing. Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron, sees this and steps in and he deals with it. The plague that happened to the Israelites was because of this sin and it took 24,000 lives but would have taken more if Phinehas hadn't stepped in. And as this portion starts, it says (JR read Verses 10-13.)  In the life and the actions of Phinehas we can see the life of Jesus. There was no one more zealous for a nation than Jesus. Phinehas was zealous for the Name of God in this Chapter 25 of Numbers but you won't find anyone who was more zealous for people than Jesus. Just as Phinehas acted zealously, so Jesus acted zealously. Just as Phinehas turned away God's wrath from people, Jesus turned away God's wrath from people. Just as Phinehas offered himself in place of Israel, Jesus offered Himself in place of Israel. Just as Phinehas suffered for the sin of the people, so Jesus suffered for the sin of the people. Just as God made a covenant of peace with Phinehas, so God made a covenant of peace with Jesus. Just as God offered Phinehas an eternal priesthood through the family of Aaron, so God offered Jesus an eternal priesthood.  
 
Now I want to go back to Exodus 1 for this next snapshot today. I want to go back to Exodus 1 and remember the book of Genesis ends with the family of Joseph, the family of Jacob, who has gone to Egypt. They went in as 70 people from the family of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Remember, Joseph went there because he was sold into slavery so he went there to begin with and then through his life, God made a way to bring the rest of his family there. When we start the book of Exodus the family of Israel is in Egypt and it says this in Exodus 1:6. (JR read Verses 6-7 and then continued reading Verse 12a.) What happened when they got to Egypt was that God took them in, and we talked about this at the time, that God took them in as a ""family,"" but He brought them out as a ""nation."" When they were in the land, the sages and rabbis teach and speak about how they had miraculous fertility—how the women were having babies and babies and babies and babies, and how God just poured out His blessing on them, and a big part of that was the whole process of bringing in a family and bringing out a nation. They go in as ""70"" but they come out as ""2-3 million."" That's fertile! That is reproduction! I bring that up because throughout those years it was multiplication—exponential growth—of the people. We get to the book of Numbers and the book of Numbers is right upon them coming out. In Numbers 1 we find that the first census was taken—the first census to find out how many soldiers they had available and that was the whole reasoning to find out how many soldiers they had at their disposal. And in the first census we find that the numbered fighting men counted to be 603,550 so basically 604,000 men (rounded up) that were ready to fight. Now, we have 40 years they wandered in the wilderness. From that time when there were 603,000 fighting men we have this wandering period in the wilderness.
 
In Chapter 26 we come to the second census; the second census taken 40 years later and the number of soldiers counted at this time are just shy of 602,000—they have actually decreased in numbers. As one generation has died off and replaced by another generation they have actually decreased, but essentially it is the same when you're talking about 602 – 603,000 men. So it is essentially the same, but technically it has decreased. I started to think about this; I started to think just what is God doing here? They have now come full circle. In Chapter 1 they sat on the edge of the land of promise—the land that was promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; it was promised to their family as they were going in to take it and live there but that family at that time rejected it. They rejected it. They chose to grumble and complain against God; they chose to not trust His leadership—His leadership through Moses and so now 40 years later after the penalty of all of those soldiers at that age dying off minus two—who were the two that survived? They were Caleb and Joshua; they were the only two that survived. Now they've spent 40 more years and their numbers have actually decreased. That fertility—that rapid reproduction—it's as if God put it on hold. I was thinking about that this week and I was thinking, 'what is God doing here?' Why was there multiplication, multiplication, multiplication, and suddenly it goes into neutral? I don't know for sure but as I spent time over the last week or two looking and thinking through this story, I have to think they came to this point and God said to them in a spiritual way, 'You don't need more warriors; you need more trust.' 'You don't need more warriors; you need more trust.' Now think about this for a minute because it makes sense in a practical human sense because the first time they numbered 603,000 soldiers; 40 years later they would have come to  the line again, and it's time to cross over and now they if they would have 750,000 soldiers, in human terms it would be easy to rationalize, 'Now we have more soldiers; now we have more fighters; now we can go do this,' but God is saying 'You don't need more; it is essentially the same and what I'm looking for is I'm not looking to have more of you, but for you to have more of Me. Is this generation any different than your forefathers? Will you trust Me in ways that they didn't?' And even if that is not what God was intentionally doing, that was the opportunity they had. Because now they stand at the line of battle—the line to cross over—with the same number—the same ratio—the same odds.  The question is 'Do you trust?'
 
And I believe that God would ask us the same question today. How much more would you have to have in any one area of life to trust God more? How much multiplication would there have to be for me to trust God at a higher level, or do I have the spiritual maturity in that place where I can say 'I don't need more? I just need to trust.' He's already given me more than enough—more than enough.
 
This past week at VBS in the story of Gideon, and I was reminded of it watching the video when Matt was blowing the shofar—they were doing the story of Gideon, I was reminded in this whole scope of how in the story of Gideon in the book of Judges God actually said to Gideon when he goes to fight, 'What, you have too many warriors—too many soldiers, so you need to trim them down.' So Gideon trims them down dramatically leaving only 300 soldiers.  Why?  Because I believe that God wanted to erase any question in Gideon's mind as to who brought forth the victory. It wasn't because of them; it was because of Him and it was because they trusted and were willing to go anyway.
 
In Numbers 27 we find a glimpse of Jesus. Starting in Verse 12; this where God is telling Moses that he won't be going into the Promised Land because he was disobedient (JR read Numbers 27:12-17.) The Midrash teaching of the sages and the rabbis—they say this language here where Moses says 'to give them one who will lead them out and bring them in . . . .' what they teach in this—what the rabbis teach, is what Moses was asking was basically the question YoVerNNu'who will lead them now and who will lead them in the future?'—that Moses was saying, 'Don't leave this people. Give them someone who will lead them now at this present time but don't abandon them in the future—give them someone they can trust.' (JR continued reading Verse 18,--take Joshua—take Yehoshua, and make him your leader.) I hope you hear the language there. Yehoshua in the Hebrew is the same as the transliteration of Jesus' Yeshua. Jesus is a namesake—He has the same name as Joshua of the Old Testament and Moses pleads with God here to 'Make sure, please God, give us someone who will lead our people now and someone who will lead this family in the future.' And God says, 'Take Jesus—take Yehoshua—take Yeshua.' We find in the book of Joshua (Yehoshua) that Joshua was the one to lead them in that time, in that day, to do the thing that God had promised them, but we also find through Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John that Yehoshua is the one that God set forth to lead them in the future.
 
Next snapshot! I pondered and debated on spending lots of time on one of these; instead I decided to surf through a bunch of them. We get to Numbers 28; the first two chapters goes over again the different feasts and some of the different sacrifices—God is repetitive, if you haven't figured that out in this Torah—He just repeats and repeats and repeats. In Chapter 28 it is talking about the daily offerings. (He began reading Verses 1-5.) The daily offering—it was to be a burnt offering. If you remember when we went through the burnt offerings, the burnt offering was the burnt offering where 'there was nothing in it for me.' There was nothing in it for the one who is offering it. This is all about God; this is all Him—the people got nothing back from it. We find throughout Scriptures that these daily times of prayer—that the morning and evening prayers became very purposed in the life of the Nation of Israel. And in the morning—every day—there was a lamb that was offered as a sacrifice, as part of the ritual of their prayer. Every morning there would be a lamb that was offered and then at twilight at evening time, there was a lamb offered. It's interesting, though, that the word we use for ""twilight"" doesn't mean the same thing in Judaism; it doesn't—when we think of twilight we think of right when the sun is going down toward the beginning of evening, but within Judaism if you go back and read pretty much all of them, they all say that twilight is ""mid-afternoon."" The morning sacrifices were offered between 6-9 a.m. in the morning and the twilight sacrifices (or the afternoon sacrifices) were offered between 2-3 p.m. in the afternoon—every day—every day, within the life of Israel. There was a lamb offered in the morning and a lamb offered in the mid-afternoon—a burnt offering—given totally to God.
 
In Mark 15:21 it says (JR read Verses 21 – 34.) The picture that we have of Jesus on the cross is that the writer of the book of Mark tells us specifically that Jesus' Crucifixion began at the 9th hour, the time of the morning sacrifice. Jesus was crucified upon a cross at the same time, not only the Passover lambs were being offered because it was during Passover, but the morning sacrifice lambs were being offered and that Jesus died at the time that the evening lambs were being offered. Don't think for a minute that the writers of the Gospels, when they put that information in there, that they were putting it in there so we would know what time it was—there is a reason why they wanted us to know what time it was because in the scope of the American mindset, it doesn't matter to us whether He was crucified at 9 in the morning or 10 in the morning or 7 a.m.—it doesn't matter but the writers are trying to communicate something and it is that Jesus is the picture of the burnt offerings and He fulfills both of those roles. 
 
Let's skip over to Numbers 29 for our last snapshot picture of Jesus today. In Numbers 29—the end of this portion—it starts with the Feast of Trumpets. Now, I could have gone down through these but I didn't go through all the other pictures of Jesus, starting with the Passover, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because we've spent time .with those in the past, so I didn't want to spend time on those again here today. But I did want to get to Numbers 29:12 and following, basically through the end of the chapter. It's kind of a weird read. It's talking about Sukkot, about the Feast of Tabernacles. (JR read Verse 12 and skipped through several verses following.) Verse 13 says 13 bulls; Verse 17 says 12 bulls, in Verse 20 it says on the 3rd day, it was 11 bulls, and the next day it was 10 bulls, then 9 bulls, then 8 bulls, and on the 7th day they were to offer 7 bulls, and so for this 7-day festival it was kind of an odd thing. They were to offer 13 bulls, then the next day 12, then the next day 11, then the next day 10, and then 9, 8, and then they get down to 7 and that ends the festival.
 
What does that have to do with anything? I think it's teaching a bigger picture; I believe that it is teaching a bigger picture because if you add 13 + 12 + 11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7, you will find that over the course of Sukkot—over the course of the Feast of Tabernacles—they offered 70 bulls. That number 70, according to the sages and rabbis is the number that is representative of the nations of the world, and what you find is that throughout the course of the Sukkot Festival, they offer 1 bull for every nation of the world. What does that matter?
 
Well, in Zechariah 14:16 it is a teaching on the Feast of Sukkot. It's a teaching on the Feast of Sukkot—not now, but in the future. It's a teaching on the Feast of Sukkot and Jesus, how He helps to fulfill the Feast of Tabernacles in Verse 16; it says (JR read it.) The Festival of Tabernacles of Sukkot was a celebration of the Israelites wandering in the wilderness and their coming to freedom in a new land, but it's not a celebration that is exclusive to the Israelites. God has chosen to reach out to the nations of the world and to offer the invitation 'If you want peace; if you want refuge; if you want to be in a place where I will provide safety, come to Me.' The book of Numbers teaches that picture ahead of time through the sacrifices of the bulls.
 
Friends, we're getting ready to have a baptism in just a couple of minutes and I'm super excited about it; I'm so excited about it because this relationship for me extends back a few years to basketball.  Donnie Evans is coming in a few minutes and I'm going to jump back there and get ready as we sing our last song. He told me a few weeks ago; he came to the couches and he said, 'Listen, I need to do this now because if I don't do it now, I'm not ever going to do it; God is speaking to me now and I've got to be obedient.' And it has been a way cool thing for me to see in the last year how God has spoken into Donnie's life. Friends, God can and wants to do the same thing for you. The world is a prison and as I've spoken in the last 2 weeks previous to today, the world is a prison—the world is a snare; the world is a place filled with deceit—the world is a place where Satan makes wrong things look right and right things look wrong. It's a world of confusion; it's a world filled with traps, but Jesus came to set you free. Jesus came to set you free from bondage; Jesus came to set you free from all of the things that you struggle with. It doesn't mean that we won't still struggle because that's life in this world. The Apostle Paul talked about it; it's life in this world—getting up every day and going to battle and going to war, knowing that war is raging against your soul, but Jesus is the one who declares the victory and my prayer is that through faith in Him, you will claim that same victory. Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Jesus, thank you; thank you for your goodness. Lord, I thank you for the pictures we see of you that are just so numerous, even in this portion of the Bible that we, a lot of times, ignore or skip over. God, your Word is so rich. Lord, I pray, as much as anything that we capture again these snapshots of Jesus that are on every page in every verse of Scripture. Lord, the reason He is there is because He is the one who has come to save. It is in His Name and in His Name only—the Name of Yeshua—that we call to for salvation. He is the One who gives grace and mercy and peace so God, I pray that if there is anyone who needs to make a decision to trust you and follow you, just as Donnie has today, Lord, I pray that today would be a new start, that today would be a day of deliverance, that today would be a time of leaving the wilderness and crossing the Jordan. Lord, thank you, and it's in the Name of Jesus, we pray, Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",7/31/2016,
"It is fantastic what the Beaver Family and others have done to invest in our kids.  We all know what visuals do and when they step in here tonight on the first evening of our VBS they will see this gigantic time machine.  This will give them experiences as the visuals are so powerful; they will be able to step inside and go back to places in time with God and witness different things that have happened.  Many are involved in this week-long event so I ask you to pray for all those teaching and serving in any way that God will really penetrate their hearts and souls and they will be different. 
 
I just got back Thursday night from a week in the jungle; this past week was Jungle Huts. It was amazing; I got there and in the middle of the jungle at those huts that are about 10 feet off the ground—they had installed air conditioning for us just specifically for this week and I have to tell you that I told the kids one night—we were standing around the campfire and I said, ""Let's sit around the campfire,"" and they said ""There is no fire,"" to which I replied, ""Use your imagination!"" And that's the air conditioner that I had; it was using our imagination that it was actually cool in those huts. It was an amazing time; we had 42 4th, 5th, and 6th graders. That probably doesn't seem like many to you but having that many for several days---that's a lot. Jungle Hut capacity is really supposed to be 30—they really like it to be 25 but we had 42 so we way exceeded capacity but it's hard for me to tell kids they can't come so when I see a waiting list it's really hard and makes it difficult but God was good and God worked us through that. It was a great week with very, very, very minimal problems with the kids. Listen to this; it sounds like an oxymoron—4th, 5th, and 6th graders so well behaved for the whole time. You know I've come back in the past with some crazy stories; I had one person tell me last week, 'Oh, you're going to Jungle Huts this next week; I can't wait for the stories you will tell,' but this time they just didn't give me any. For the most part, they did what I asked them to do. I will say this that on our last night there we were getting ready to go up at midnight to do a thing with the other camp that was there, as they had invited us up to join in, but I was talking to my kids that my biggest concern was that they couldn't be quiet and it was at that point that Lucas raised his hand and said, ""I can be quiet,"" and I thought 'No way'—that's impossible, cause he was my one challenge all week as I had to keep saying to him, ""Would you please be quiet?"" But you know if you have a group of kids together and that's your biggest issue, so be it. That's not really that big of an issue and it's not that big of a deal.
 
One of the things that I told them was during one of the evenings; I told them, 'This is the only time this group will ever be together.' We had 8 or 10 adults and we had 42 kids so we had about 50 to 55 people and I told them, ""This is the only time that this group of people will ever be together."" I continued, ""If we were ever to have a Jungle Hut reunion at Christmas, maybe during Christmas Break, somebody is not going to be able to be there."" ""If we were to do this same camp next year and move the age group from 4th through 6th grade to 5th through 7th grade and just invite all of you back to do the exact same camp, for whatever reason, not everybody will be able to be there, whether it's adults or whether it's kids, it just wouldn't happen."" Then I went on to tell them this:  ""The thing that really makes me sad is if I go by what God's Word says, that if we were to have this Jungle Hut group reunion in Heaven someday, we will not all be there; we will not all be there."" Some will choose the wide path; some will choose the broad road that leads to destruction.
 
Some of the things I said in here last week will overlap today that Jesus Himself said that 'Many will say to me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not do all these things?' to which Jesus will reply, ""Away from me; I never knew you."" It grieves me; it breaks my heart that I would have to stand before a group of 42 4th through 6th graders that according to odds of what God says scripturally, we couldn't even have a reunion in Heaven because not everyone will choose Jesus—not everyone will choose Jesus. Now that same application is made even on a greater level here at ACC, as we have 500 people. I would love to say that whoever is here today that we would be able to come back and have a reunion of this day in Heaven, but the reality is some won't choose the narrow path; some will choose to live life on their own apart from God. Now we don't like to deal with that reality because we like to live in a happy world—in a happy place. I understand that, but if the Scriptures are true, that's what God has spoken.
 
The world is at war and that's what I talked about last week; the world is at war against your soul. The world in its way; the world in its desires—the world that we know today Jesus said 'Satan is the prince of this world.' Now we know that Jesus is the King of the world to come, but Jesus Himself said that Satan is the prince of this world and he is at war against your soul and he desires for you to be destroyed.
 
Today's Torah portion is Numbers 22:2 through 25:9, but I am just going to look at scattered verses in Chapter 22. At the beginning of this chapter in this portion, and this portion is named in the first sentence, Balak. (JR read Numbers 22:1 through 22:6a.) Now as this story evolves, Balak sends a delegation to Balaam to get him; Balaam says he won't go because God intervenes and tells him not to go. Another delegation is sent with more dignitaries—with more hype—and I want you to understand as this evolves, I want you to make the connection that this is how Satan often works in our lives. This is how Satan often works in our lives because he will throw things out there and if it is not enough to lure us in, he will throw out bigger and better things even more to eventually entice us. You know if you go fish and you use the same lure over and over and over and over, you won't catch anything—most people wouldn't sit there for 2 hours using the same lure so what do we do? We change bait. I mean, if you've got a 5-year old with you, you change bait every cast; no, you don't re-bait, you change bait every cast because they don't like that one because it didn't work that one time. I think Satan is a little more patient than that; I think that he would use that lure and use that lure and use that lure but eventually he is going to change it; he's going to give himself every opportunity to get you.
 
So Balak summons for Balaam and he tries to persuade him; finally Balaam agrees to come and he comes under the premise that he's going to do what?—he's going to curse the Israelites. That was the whole point of the trip. The whole point of the trip was for Balaam to bring out prophetic curses upon the nation of Israel, the nation that was to be blessed to be doing it upon the Israelites that were. As the story evolves we find that God intervenes. God intervenes and puts Himself in the middle of the story and as Balaam stands to pronounce his curses, they actually come out of his mouth as blessings. He blesses Israel and Balak is beside himself and says 'What are you doing? I ask you to come here to curse them, but yet you bless them.'
 
Now I think there is a big picture here that we can see. I think there is a big picture that ties into life as we know it. I believe that that is the satanic plot—the satanic strategy—I believe that it's what Satan wants and desires for your life. I believe he wants to bring Balak into your life to pronounce curses upon you. I believe that those of you that are down in a hole and struggling to get up that he wants to put his foot on you to keep you there. And those of you who are out roaming free and doing well, he wants you to find the pit. As you are walking through this world we call a ""jungle"" which it is—I mean when we look around, we see that it is a jungle; it's a dangerous place but Satan wants it to be like we see in the movies especially in the old days when they had these movies and they would dig a big hole and they would put stuff over it so you couldn't see that there was a hole there and as you walk along, you take a step and the next thing you know, you're in the bottom of the pit. Most of us understand Satan to be clever that he covers that hole and disguises it well, because if he just left a big hole there, most of us will walk right along and we would see it so could avoid it; we would maneuver our way around it, but he disguises it.
 
In John 15:18 Jesus addressed this. (JR read Verses 18-21.) They will treat you this way because of my name. Listen to this, friends: If you are a follower of Jesus, you will be targeted. You will be targeted. Now, in our airports, we are not supposed to target people—I mean that's the politically correct thing to do. The politically correct thing to do at an airport is not to target the people that might be dangerous; it's to shake down the 94-year old grandma who can barely make her way on to the plane to make sure she's not carrying anything that's dangerous. But I'm telling you that if you're a follower of Jesus, you will be targeted. You will be targeted at least in two different ways. You will be targeted by Satan and ultimately he is the one that's behind all of it. You will be targeted by Satan. I mentioned John 10:10 last week where it says the enemy—the thief—his desire is to steal, kill, and destroy and he wants to steal, kill and destroy essentially everything that you have that is good because the Scriptures teach that every good and perfect gift is from above. And so anything that you have that is good that he can equate to God's goodness in your life, he is going to set out to destroy it because he doesn't want God's blessing in your life. He is going to set out to pronounce a curse upon you, upon your family so that he can lead you to a pit of destruction.
The second way that you will be targeted—it's still by Satan, but I believe this; I believe that he will send Balak into your life. It will be people; it will be people—Satan will send Balak into your life to try to summon up a Balaam to try to scheme, to plot, to strategize and to do everything—and he will use people to do this—to do everything that they can do in order to destroy you. This is where it's hard for us—it's hard to discern and keep truth straight because Paul says that our battle is not against what?—it is not against flesh and blood, but we often times get lured into the battle of flesh and blood. I mean, we have a certain thing in our mind that this person's the enemy and in reality there is something behind that person that's causing the friction. It is all satanic strategy to destroy our lives. Satan goes after God's chosen by using Balak to summon Balaam and there is no reason for me to think, according to Jesus' words, that if they persecute you, 'remember they persecuted me first and you will be persecuted because of me.' There is no reason for me to think that Balak is not going to come onto the scene in my life, too. Satan has not changed his strategy; he'll adapt it and he'll adjust it, but even though he may change the strategies a little bit, he ultimately doesn't change his goal and that is to steal, to kill, and to destroy.
 
In 1 John 2:15-17, a passage that I referred to last week where the Apostle John says this: (JR read it.)  That's one of the fishing lures that Satan uses; it's the world and it's the desires we have for more stuff, for bigger, for better and it's not just material things that I have been talking about the last few weeks; sometimes it's experiences. Sometimes it's just doing things that stimulate us and excite us. (JR repeated Verse 17.) In 1 John 4:4, he said, (JR read it.)  He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. You see, we have this civil war—I believe we have this civil war going on in our bodies. Galatians 5 talks about the desire, the simple nature, and how it conflicts with the desires of the spirit. You know for those who aren't Christians, there's not really a civil war going on because the Spirit of God does not reside in us, but for those of us who are believers and followers of Jesus who have been born again and His Spirit resides in us, we have that internal struggle of fleshly and carnal things pulling us one direction and God on the other side, saying 'no, no, no, that's the world and the world's desires will pass away, but the one who does the will of God lives forever.' In 1 John 5:2 the Apostle John says this: (JR read Verses 2-5.)  
 
You see ultimately I believe if we could only have one title—we talked about this at Jungle Huts this past week—we talked about one of our super heroes being Moses. We talked about God appearing to Moses through the burning bush and Moses was firing away at his excuses and he said, 'God, if I go to the Pharaoh and tell him who is it that I tell him you are?—so what's your name?' There are a lot of gods; what's your name? And God simply says what?—'I am; I am that I am.' I talked to the kids about that asking what would God mean ""name?"" How did God think Moses was going to name Him? Is there any name that we could give to God that totally describes everything about who He is? Just think about Jesus. How many names do we have for Jesus? Tell me right now—how many names can we come up with? I was actually shocked at how many names the kids were firing out at camp. Tell me how many names or different titles do we have for Jesus? Give me some. (Here audience members spoke aloud the following: Messiah, King of Kings, Savior, Trinity, Emmanuel, God among us, Friend, Rock, the Bread of Life, Alpha and Omega, Light of the World, Good Shepherd.) I mean we could just go on and on couldn't we, and all of those names have a different slant to who He is. Who is it that we can call God? What is the Name that we can give Him that would fully describe Him? I Am. He just is. But here I just read a passage to you that if there is maybe one title that we should have—if there is one title that we should have, it might be in the passage that I just read to you. It is ""overcomer."" Overcomer!—that we are overcomers—those who love God; those who trust God, he refers to them as ""overcomers."" We've overcome the world; we've overcome the obstacles; we've overcome the battle lines that Satan has drawn—the wars that he has put up against us. Anybody in here been in a battle with Satan? Did you feel that attack? Once in your life?—twice in your life? Constantly?—in your life? If you get to the end of your life and they can write on your tombstone ""overcomer"" in reference to what God says here, you are right where God wants you to be. You are right where God wants you to be; that means you fully trusted in Jesus. That means you have fully surrendered in Him. Now, why do I say 'that's a great title?'
 
When I get to the book of Revelation 2 and 3, this is what I find in the 7 letters to the 7 churches. In the last book that He writes to us—a book about Heaven—a book about end times—a book about all these different things. This is what he says and I'm going to fire down a bunch of verses that are all in Chapters 2 and 3. He says:
 
   To those who overcome I will give the right to eat from the Tree of Life. Guess what?—that is in the New Eden. That is in Eden restored—that is eternal life, my friends.
   To those who overcome they will not be hurt by the second death. The overcomer will not be hurt by the second death. What's the second death?—the second death is beyond the first death—the first death is simply the physical—the second death is spiritual death but to he who overcomes, he will not be hurt at all by the second death.
   To him that overcomes I will give him some of the hidden manna. I will give to him some of the hidden manna. Really you could take this into some deep levels, but this is Jesus who was the Bread, the Manna of God.
   To them who overcomes I will give them a white stone with a new name written on it. To him who overcomes will get a white stone which was symbolic in a courtroom for what? In today's world we have someone stand up and open the envelope and read something. In that world you either got a white stone or a black stone; the black stone meant you were what?—guilty, and a white stone meant you were innocent. To him who overcomes, God will give him a white stone—not because you're good, but because Jesus was good—not because you can earn salvation, but because Jesus died so that you would have salvation through Him.
   To them who overcomes and does my will to the end, I will give him authority over the nations. H
   To them that overcomes, I will give them the Morning Star, and we know Jesus to be the Morning Star.
   To them that overcomes, they will be dressed in white.
   To them that overcomes, I will never blot their names from the Book of Life. Their names will never be blotted from the Book of Life, but will be acknowledged before my Father.
   To them that overcomes, I will make pillars in the Temple of my God.
   To them that overcomes, I will write on them the Name of my God and the Name of the City of my God, the New Jerusalem.
   To Him who overcomes, I will also write on them my new Name. And finally, He says
   To those who overcome, I will give them the right to sit with Me on my throne.
 
Thirteen promises made in Revelation 2 and 3—13 promises to overcomers—13 promises that hold your future—13 promises that give you hope—13 promises that give you a picture of God's love for you in even a different way than Jesus hanging on a cross. Friends, you want to have the title of ""overcomer."" You want to have that title, but it's hard because this world is at war against you. And sometimes—sometimes when we get knocked down and we've seen it in movies before when there is a boxing match and the guy is getting obliterated and his corner guy will grab the towel and start to throw it and in the movies, the guy laying on the floor with blood all over him says what?—'don't do it; I'm okay. This is going just the way I planned it.' But sometimes your corner guy knows it's over and he throws it in because he's done and he's finished and in real life, there are times, friends, when we get knocked down to the mats and there are people who tell us to give up; for example, Job's wife—if you're not sure about that, go back and read about the loving encouragement she gave him when she said, 'Just curse God and die.' That's what she told him; 'just curse God and die.' There are people who will tell us to quit. Some of those people are Balak, sent there strategically at that time to tell you to 'just curse God and die. What are you fooling with that faith stuff for?' And sometimes it's us; we just don't feel like we have the strength or the energy to get up off the mat and fight another day, but friends, it's worth it. Jesus never said your life is going to be easy here. He said the exact opposite; He said 'If you follow Me, you're walking into a war zone and they will hate you but it's because they hated Me first.'
 
Could you today put ""overcomer"" on your tombstone? Have you fully surrendered everything that you are to God and put all of your trust—all of your hope for the future—all of your hope for eternity in the Hands of Jesus, or are you still trying to do it all on your own? If you're trying to do it on your own, that's a steep hill to climb. It's a steep hill to climb and when you get to the top, all you'll find is a cliff that you're going to fall off of because you can't do it yourself.
 
I asked kids this past week at Jungle Huts and I don't remember exactly what it was in reference to, but I said, 'If you could do this on your own, what was the reason Jesus died?' And they said, ""For nothing."" And that's the truth! If you can walk through this world on your own and get to the destination of Heaven on your own, Jesus didn't need to die and God sent His Son for nothing!   But the truth of Scripture says we can't. We will get there by hanging onto His coattail—hanging on to His Tallit—His prayer shawl, and walking with Him.  Let's pray.
 
 
 
 
Closing Prayer – God, I thank you for the life that you've given us through Jesus, and it's hard and it's a battle and it's a struggle and often times we want to quit, but Lord, I pray that we would understand to be an overcomer, that it's worth it. Lord, I pray that we would understand that there are Balaks in this world that are out to curse us and they'll use other people to curse us and use any means they can to curse us. The truth of that story was that the Israelites weren't even there to fight. They were in Moab as a temporary stopping point until they crossed the Jordan River to gain their inheritance; they weren't even there to fight, and even though they were there in peace, the enemy still tried to wage war. Lord, so many of us have that experience in our lives spiritually. Lord, I pray for divine protection for the people in this room, whether it be people who are already walking with you in faith or whether it be people who have started this journey and are trying to figure out who it is that you are and how you fill a place in their lives. Lord, I pray for divine protection for everyone. When I say divine protection, Lord, I know there are going to be physical battles—that's just the nature of it—and there are going to be spiritual battles, but I pray that you will give us divine spiritual protection that we would understand those words of Jesus 'we should not fear the one who has no control over our souls' and that is Satan. Lord, I pray that we would be able to walk with boldness, that we would have courage, that we would be overcomers. Lord, I'm excited about the baptisms which will take place at the start of 2nd service again this week and Lord, I pray that if there is anyone in here in 1st service today that needs to do that same thing, Lord, I pray that you would move their hearts and that they would understand your lead and follow through. Lord thank you. It's in Jesus' Name, we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",7/24/2016,
"We started last week with the same thing = You had better make sure that the person you are following is going the right direction or you will end up in the wrong place every single time. You had better make sure that the person you are following is going the right direction or you will end up in the wrong place EVERY SINGLE TIME. There is no exception to that—no exception at all. If the person you are following is going the wrong direction, you are going to end up in the wrong place and it is imperative in life that we walk the right direction. We as people who claim to be Jesus followers—those of us who have given our lives to Him and claim to be people of faith, we are called by the Scriptures to be in the world but not of the world. We are going to live here and be a part of life on this planet as it is where He has put us and we are to be in the world but not of the world. When it is talking about ""of the world"" it is talking about the world system that we, the church, literally means ""called out"" so we are the called out ones. Though we live here we are not part of the world system. It says 'If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.'  If we are in love with the world system, and world culture and going that direction, it's impossible for the love of God to be within us. James, the brother of Jesus, says that 'friendship with the world is hatred toward God.' Peter tells us that 'we are to be aliens and strangers in the world.' Paul tells us in the book of Philippians that 'our citizenship is in Heaven' so though we reside here, our true citizenship is in Heaven, that this is not our place and this world is not what we strive for. In Romans 12 Paul tells this to the church at Rome: ""Do not conform to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your minds."" I could go on and on and on and on and on with passages of Scripture that tell us that this world, this economy, this way of life is not who we are; it is not who we are to strive to be—that we serve a King from another place; we serve a God that is bigger than this world. We live in a world that is at war; it is at war with us. If you claim to be a follower of Jesus, this world is at war with you. The world system that Satan is directing, that he has contrived and manipulated—he is at war with you. John 10 says that the 'enemy comes to steal, to kill and destroy.' This world is at war against your soul. This world is at war against you and the holiness that God wants to be a part of your life—holiness, as we've talked through the Torah, means 'set apart for God's use,' that you are to be holy and set apart for God's use. You are an alien and a stranger in this world; you're different—you're not conformed to the pattern of this world but you are transformed by the renewing of your mind. This world is at war against the holiness that God would have us be as being people set apart and is at war with us in the area concerning righteousness. Righteousness is one of those big sounding churchy words but it's really pretty simple. ""Right"" is the root word and it simply means doing right before God.
 
God wants us to walk in the right direction; God wants us to do the right things and if we are following someone who is not going the right direction, we will end up in the wrong place every, single time. There is never an exception. 
This week's Torah portion is Chukat and it goes from Numbers 19:1 through Numbers 22:1. We are going to kind of skim through there; it's a transitional period within the life of Israel because the Israelites now have been in the desert and in the wilderness for 40 years. When we get to Chapter 19 they're ending their 40 years of wandering. They're beginning their transitional process of getting ready to go into the Promised Land. In Chapter 19 we have the story of the water; it's a story of the red heifer. There are about 10 different things in this portion of Scripture that I wish I had time to really teach. The story of the red heifer is an amazing thing. The red heifer in this chapter as you look at it—they would burn the animal outside the camp and take its ashes. This was not a sacrifice offered on the altar within the Tabernacle, but it was an offering that took place outside the camp and they would take the ashes of the red heifer and sprinkle it with what they called 'living water' that was not stagnant but water that they drew from a fresh source and they would spill out water that they referred to as living water. The waters were mixed together and one of the main things that that water was used for was for people who were ritually unclean because of contamination from a dead body. If someone were to touch a dead body you became ritually unclean; within Judaism it was considered the highest state of uncleanliness; I mean it was about as bad as you could get. Remember that being unclean wasn't a sin; there were several times in Jesus' ministry that He became unclean—Jesus touched a leper—Jesus touched dead people; Jesus became ritually unclean but that wasn't itself a sin; it was just a state of purity as far as their ability to go into the Temple or the Tabernacle, but here we have the story of the red heifer and they would take its ashes and mix them with living water and they would sprinkle it on someone through different series of events and that's the way they would then become clean.
 
I wish I had time to develop this because if you take the life of Jesus, the book of Hebrews tells us that He was taken outside the city gates and He was crucified outside the camp, and the life of Jesus does what for us? The life of Jesus makes clean those who are bound for death due to sin. The story of the red heifer is the story of Jesus.
 
We get to Chapter 20 and it starts out like this. I want to read the first portion of it. (JR read Numbers 20:1.) Miriam, a big part of this story—we have Moses, and Aaron and Miriam throughout this whole story of the Israelites all the way back into the book of Exodus. Now Miriam dies and she's buried. (He continued reading Verse 2.) I want to stop here for just a second because something happens here with Miriam when she dies. The sages connect the water to Miriam. The sages and rabbis in the traditional teachings connect Aaron to the pillar of cloud and they connect Moses with the manna, and what they do is they teach through, in a sense, that all these things ceased upon their deaths, that when Miriam died, the water stopped and when Moses died, the manna stopped and when Aaron died, the pillar cloud that led them stopped. And I don't have time to go back and talk about the waters that we talked about previously but this is the first time that water is mentioned, for them needing water, in 40 years. At the beginning of this journey, we talked about this rock that followed them that Paul refers to in the New Testament and Paul connects it to the Messiah—that it was the Messiah—that it was Jesus that provided for them when they were in the wilderness.
And here Miriam—this is why the sages and rabbis connect it here is that Miriam dies and now the water ceases. So I want to stop and make a point here, that hundreds of years later there will come another ""Miriam"" onto the scene; you know her as Mary. And this Miriam that comes onto the scene hundreds of years later will be the one who gives birth to the ""rock"" who will call all men and women unto Himself—the One who says, 'If you are thirsty, come and drink from me, and I will give you water and you will never thirst again.' This portion goes on; it says (JR continued reading Verses 3-5.) Now here is a group of people—we talked about this last week—they have come out of bondage and slavery in Egypt and for 40 years, God has provided every single day. God has provided what they need every single day. God has provided for their needs; He gave them what they needed but He didn't necessarily give them what they wanted and us as humans fight a selfish drive. We just tend to want more. Has anyone ever given something to a child and it wasn't enough? Maybe it was your child; maybe it was another child. You have gone overboard to try and bless them with something and they give you that attitude of 'that's it?'
 
The people turn on Moses again. (JR continued reading Verses 6-12.)  Moses fails here and he really fails here under the pressure of the grumbling and complaining of the people. They kept at him and at him and at him and at him and he didn't listen to the instruction of the Lord. You see this is the opposite way that God had told him to do it earlier. At the beginning of the journey, God had told him to strike the rock and here He tells him to speak to the rock and it seems harsh that God would say, 'Because of this you've given up 40 years of your life and you've gone through so much struggle leading these people, but you are now not to enter the Promised Land and you're not going to lead them into it either.' Does that mean God took Heaven away and salvation away?—No, I don't think that's what it's talking about. What God is saying is there are consequences in behavior—there are consequences in behavior and Aaron is standing right beside him. If God doesn't deal with this—if God doesn't deal with this behavior issue from what He had told Moses to do and Moses not doing it; if He just overlooks or ignores it, what's that telling the rest of the people? He's serious when He speaks, but He doesn't really mean it?  But God means what He says and He says what He means. You know there are those moments in life where we would all like to go back and have a redo. Anyone in here like to be able to go back and have a redo? Maybe things that we've said—I mean it doesn't have to be weeks or years later that we regret what was done because sometimes the words are about right here and we're wishing we could grab them and shove them back in. There are a lot of things we wish that we could have redo's on and I imagine if Moses were to reflect back on his life, I think this is one that Moses would have liked to have had a redo. Because I would have to think after 40 years of struggling through that wilderness, he was really looking forward to seeing the land that was promised to his forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the land he had heard about over and over and over and over—this land of promise that he was not going to be allowed to lead the people into. Oh, we'll see in the book of Deuteronomy that Moses gets to see it—that God lets him see it but only from across the borders because he wasn't allowed to enter.
 
It's important that we pick up lessons from the life of Moses that obedience matters. Obedience matters and when we don't obey, there are consequences and we suffer and sometimes it hurts and it's painful and is it that God wants us to hurt?—or because God wants us to suffer? Do our parents punish us because they want us to hurt or because they want us to suffer? Or does God do that and lead us in those directions because He wants us to become a people who we can be—ultimately it's because He wants to protect us and lead us into the place where He would most want us to be. It's also important that we understand that our grumbling against contentment is grumbling against God. In American culture, we are so obese with excess; I mean, we just have so much stuff but we drive to get more. And when we grumble and complain in our hearts about God about the stuff that we don't have all the time, rather than focusing on what we do have and the blessings that we have; it doesn't mean we don't hurt—doesn't mean we don't struggle but we need to be people that have an attitude of thanksgiving and being grateful to God for what He has given us.
 
We move on and we get to Numbers 21. We find that the people are still railing out against Moses. Aaron has just died at the end of Chapter 20 so Miriam dies and then Aaron dies and we get to Numbers 21:4—(JR reads first half of Verse 4.)  They are working their way up the Eastern side of the land of Israel; they are beginning this process of getting to the border to where they can cross over. (JR continued reading Verses 4b-5.) ""There is no bread; we detest this miserable food."" ""There is no bread; we detest this miserable food."" Do you hear what they're saying? 'There is food but it is not what we want.' 'I don't want peanut butter and jelly; I want grilled cheese.' 'I don't want a hamburger; I want pizza.' (JR continued reading Verses 6-7.) Wouldn't you get sick of this if you were Moses? C'mon, isn't there a degree to which you would want to say 'Too bad, so sad?' or 'Let me play my little violin for you.' You know as a leader he would have to be so frustrated at this continual cycle—they mumble and grumble and complain and backstab against him but as soon as they get into trouble, they come to him to bail them out. And then they do it again and they come to him again and they do it again somewhat like little kids learning to be adults—somewhat like me. They say 'Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away.' (JR continued reading Verses 8-9.) Have you ever looked at the back of an ambulance? Do you know what that little sign is? It's a pole with a snake on it. The Scripture is where all that stuff originates from. 'Pray that the Lord will take the snakes away.' Well, guess what? The Lord did not take the snakes away. God did not take the snakes away, but what He did was He left the struggle. The struggle was still there, but what He did was He made it into an act of trust. God left the struggle—He left the snakes, but He turned it into an act of trust. 'Do you really trust me through this struggle; when you get bitten, do you have enough faith and trust in me to come and do something as ludicrous as looking at a bronze snake on a pole?' Because we all know that doesn't make a snakebite go away unless the God that said, 'Let there be light' intervenes. So do you trust? And the application here for us is the same. God is not always going to take away our struggles; sometimes He will; sometimes He won't. Paul wanted God to take away his struggle—three times Paul prayed that the thorn in his flesh would be gone, but God answered, ""My grace is sufficient for you."" In other words, 'trust me.' God will not always take away our struggles but what He does do through our struggles is that He allows that to be a thing to draw us to Him. But that's up to who? That's up to us. That's up to us and what we want from that.
 
In John 3 we find a story about a man named Nicodemus and Nicodemus was a Pharisee. He had been raised with the teachings of the sages and the rabbis which are the very things that I'm trying to pull out of this Torah series and bring out to shed light on are the very things that Nicodemus was raised up in. He was taught these very same things and I told you from the outset of this that one of my goals is to try to have the mindset and the understanding of what did it mean to be a Jewish person living in the times of Jesus. What was their filter; what were the things they knew and what were the things they understood? And here in John 3:1-2 it says (JR read those two verses.)  No one could perform the signs; God had said 'I will send you a prophet like Moses.' All through the Torah we find this mindset that Moses is a foreshadow of the true prophet that was to come later. And Nicodemus recognizes that Jesus is this Prophet like Moses—that He's doing these great signs. (JR continued reading Verses 3-15 emphasizing Verse 14.) Jesus is making the application to Nicodemus, the Pharisee, 'Go back to the book of Numbers; go back to the Torah where it speaks of me, though with Moses, it was snakes and snakebites' and this snake that was lifted up on a pole and people would look upon it. Now, why would they put a snake on a pole? Why wouldn't they put a cherubim or an angel or something similar on a pole? Well, let's go back to the beginning. Where did the curse start? It all started with temptation--with the serpent—the brokenness of mankind and this picture of the brokenness of mankind is erected up on a pole and Jesus is telling this Pharisee who had learned the traditions of the sages and the rabbis to 'understand that this story of Moses and your forefathers is really a story about me. Just as the snake was lifted up in the desert, so I will be lifted up and I will heal their snakebites; I will heal their brokenness.'
 
It doesn't stop there though. Those applications don't stop there. In Isaiah 11:12 it says this about God. It says (JR read the verse.) It says that He will raise a banner; the banner that He will raise there is the word ""nes"" and it's the exact same word for that pole that's lifted up. It's the exact same word—that He will raise a banner over the people and that He will call the nations to Himself. The pole that He is speaking of within the life of Israel throughout their history where they would fight wars and they would fight battles and they would be in a battle down in a valley somewhere and once they would gain control of a hill, someone would go up on the hillside and they would raise the ""nes""—they would raise the pole—they would raise the standard—they would raise the banner and people would know that's a place they could go to for safety.
 
In the Gospel of John, Chapter 12, starting in Verse 30, Jesus said, (JR read Verses 30-32.) When Jesus talked about this, He was talking about the standard; He was talking about this banner being raised that showed a place where you could run to not just for healing, but a place that you could run to for safety.
 
Where do you run when you need healing? Is it to a person?—is it to a friend? We have a lot of different places that we go and those things aren't inherently bad—sometimes God uses people to give us wise counsel and to help us. But that only happens when that person knows where he is going and they're walking the right direction because if you're getting your help from someone—if you're getting your safety from someone and they are walking the wrong direction, you are going to end up in the wrong place every, single time. That's why truth should always be measured against God's Word. When someone is telling you something is true, it should be measured against whether God says that it's true. And if the things that your friend or your spouse or whoever is telling you in your time of need or trying to give you comfort and safety—if they connect with the truth of God, then it really is of God and it does provide us safety and it does provide us comfort.
 
Who do you run to?  Too many people in the world in which we live run to lots of wrong places. Our culture in the world in which we live that we are not to be bought into, we are in a state of addiction unlike anything I've ever seen. I had meetings with people this week out my ears, it seemed like, where things tracked back to the same addictions, the most tragic of which was the death of a 31-year old father of two because he couldn't shake his addictions to alcohol and other drugs and it was the saddest of sad stories. It just broke my heart because his mother each day would tell her husband 'I wonder when we're going to get the call' because she knew that it was coming. She knew her son was following the wrong person and was going to end up in the wrong place. It was painful.
 
To where do you run? Do you run to that standard that God has set up to where He says there will be healing? Or do you run elsewhere? In 2 Kings 18, it starts out like this: (JR read Verses 1-4.)  The very thing that was the symbol of healing became the symbol or the object of their worship. Look how subtle this is! We're in Numbers—we're in this Torah portion where God provides a bronze snake on a pole that if people look on it, they get healed. But rather than understanding in the future, and rather than understanding that it was God that did the healing, they began to worship the pole—and the snake! We need to make sure that we never, ever ever put the object ahead of the Savior!  We do not worship the cross. We worship the sacrifice and this is a subtle thing when you read the story of Hezekiah and you see how God spoke out against the worship of the bronze snake and the pole. We are not drawn to objects; we are to be drawn to the person of Jesus who gives you hope, who loves you with a passion, who gives you the opportunity for forgiveness, but the choice is yours as to whether or not you will look upon Him. Let's pray.
 
 
Closing Prayer – God, thank you—thank you for this day and for the depth of your Word. Lord, I just wish I had weeks to spend on this Torah portion for some of the things that we could plunge way down into. But Lord, I pray that by your Spirit that you will speak today, that you would speak into our hearts that we would individually catch the things that we need personally. Lord, God, thank you that you forgive our rebellion. Thank you that you are willing to forgive our hard heartedness. Lord, I thank you that as we walk through life we know there is One that we can follow whose destination is already known and that if we follow Jesus, we will end up in the right place every single time. When we turn and start going our own way and sometimes follow other people who are connected to the world that we will end up lost. God, may you give us the wisdom and the courage to walk the right direction. Lord, thank you for Jesus—for His courage; thank you for His boldness in His walk to the cross that He would become the snake upon the pole, so to speak and Lord, that He would become the sacrifice and that He would become death and sin in our place so that we might experience the Promise Land and that we might experience eternal life with you. God, I pray that if there is anyone in here today that needs to make a decision to follow you that needs to be buried who needs to die to their own self and needs to go through what Nicodemus talked about that the birthing process—being born of water. The baptistery is a womb and a tomb; it's a place of birth and it's a place of death. Lord, if there is anyone in here that needs to die to their old self and be born again, Lord, I pray that today might be a day of salvation. I'm excited about the ones who will be doing that at the start of 2nd service today. Lord, I pray that your Spirit might be here. It's in Jesus' Name I pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",7/17/2016,
"Several years ago when I was in college, we were on a basketball trip; we had been playing in Michigan. I was a freshman—a freshman, no-nothing—a freshman, you keep your mouth shut and let the upperclassmen lead the freshmen. We had spent 3 or 4 days in Michigan and we were headed back down 75 towards Cincinnati; we were, I think, in 3 different vehicles and I was in the one in the back. This was so long ago that I think it was a station wagon that I was riding in and I had been asleep for quite a while and I woke up and looked out the window and there was really nothing going on in our vehicle; everyone was quiet, and I see a sign, and I don't remember the exact mileage it stated, but it was like Chicago—33 miles or something like that. Now I'm just a freshman who doesn't know anything but I'm sitting there thinking 'That's not on the way to Cincinnati.' So I waited a minute because you know when you first wake up, you try to get your bearings anyway, so I was trying to shake the cobwebs out and finally said to the guy driving, 'Chad, where are we at?'  He said, 'I don't know; I'm just following the van in front of us.' I then asked, 'Well, then, who is driving the van in front of us?' And I followed with, 'And do they know where they are going?' and Chad answered, 'I don't know; I'm just following them.' I then said, 'Chad, I'm pretty sure we are not supposed to be seeing signs saying ""Chicago."" Somehow we had driven into northern Ohio and gotten on the Interstate heading west instead of south. Yeah, I don't know, for a bunch of guys who were tired and ready to be back anyway to realize that you had been going not remotely close in the right direction is a very frustrating thing. Remember, this was before cellphones, and it's 3 o'clock in the morning and we're pulling up to them on their side on the interstate hanging out the windows trying to get them to pull off so that we can turn around. You had better make sure the person that you are following is going the right direction. That's one of the simplest things that I can tell you about life. You had better make sure that the person that you are following is going the right direction. Because if you are following them and they're not, guess where you will end up?—in the wrong place every time—every time—without exception—every time. If you follow someone going the wrong direction, you will end up in the wrong place. 
 
Let's look at Numbers 16:1 thru 18:32. Our Torah portion today is Korach or Korah. This section is named for Korah and it's not a compliment, as he is the one in this Torah portion, if you read it this week, that led a rebellion against Moses but really he led a rebellion against God because Moses was God's appointed leader, so when you just cut to the chase, he stood in rebellion to God. Korah accused Moses of at least two different major violations. #1 He accused Moses of not leading them into the Promised Land—he said 'You've just brought us out here to the desert to die.' The facts of the matter that we read are what? In last week's portion Moses was ready and more than willing to lead them into the Promised Land except what? It was their decision, through their murmuring and bitter hearts not trusting God—it was their decision not to go but Korah accuses Moses of something that's not true. #2 Korah was mad at Moses/God because they had given the house of Aaron the seat of the priesthood. Now Korah was a Levite so was within the family of the Levites but the priesthood was to go through Aaron so Korah was mad and he was upset about that. And those things were the basis of their murmuring and grumbling against Moses. In Numbers 16:1-3 it says (JR read this.)  And that's what he's talking about there when he says 'We are all holy; we don't need the priesthood and we don't need to go through Aaron. We will go before God on our own.' Then in Verse 12, (JR read it and added at the end blah, blah, blah, blah, wah, wah, wah.) The two things that they opposed—the two major things they opposed—did you note the things that the sons of Eliab said? They said, (JR re-read Verse 13.) See how they reverse everything? 'We were in Egypt and we had it made; Egypt was the land flowing with milk and honey.' Oh, how quickly we forget the murmuring and grumbling they were doing when they were in that land they thought was milk and honey earlier and they summoned for God to come and rescue them and to take them out.
 
In Acts 7 we find the story of Stephen being opposed by the Sanhedrin. This is the story of the first recorded martyr of a follower of Jesus, and throughout this passage we find that Stephen is confronting the Sanhedrin; he's confronting the Jewish leadership of that day. In Verses 35-40, it says this: (JR read this passage.)  Then in Verses 51-53, it says: (JR read it, pausing after the word still.) What Stephen is doing in Acts 7 is that he is taking the Sanhedrin, the Jewish leaders, back to the time of Moses and he's saying 'Nothing has changed; your hearts and ears are still uncircumcised.' (JR then finished reading through Verse 53.) 'You have received the Law but you have not obeyed it.'
 
If you were to do a pretty thorough reading and study of this chapter, what I believe you will find is that you will find that Stephen believed that Jesus was to face rejection of the leaders just the same way as Moses was. You see God had said and He said it in the portion that I just read—God had said, 'I will send you a prophet just like Moses,' and if Jesus was to be a prophet like Moses, then He was going to experience the things that Moses experienced. And when Moses led the people out and he led them to the precipice of the Promised Land, he led them to the place where they could cross over and enjoy the bounty of God, but they stood up and they opposed him, just the same as in Jesus' day when He stood before them and said, 'The Kingdom of God is at hand,'—there was an opportunity for them to receive at that moment but their hearts were still hardened. Their hearts were still hardened, and Stephen is teaching us that. He's teaching that just like Moses when he led the people in the desert and he stood before the spiritual leaders who stood in opposition to him, so Jesus the Messiah had to do the same thing.
 
You see in the portion that we read today, Moses acted as a mediator—Moses acted as a mediator. Now a mediator is one who acts for both sides to maintain a relationship. A mediator is not one who just represents one side but they stand in between and represent both sides. Now, how do we see Moses as a mediator in this portion? We do throughout his whole life, but in this portion we see it with this and we saw it last week, too. The prophecies that God spoke through Moses—the things that God spoke into Moses that he then spoke into the people were God's voice and God's word to Israel. When he spoke the prophecies, he stood representing the side of God to say 'This is what the Holy One expects' and 'This is what the Holy One declares.' But at the same time Moses stood before God to give petitions for the sake of Israel. And we see different times where Moses stood before God and pleaded with God and begged God to have mercy to turn His head and to excuse their ignorance. Moses acted as a mediator. In the Temple context of the life of the Jewish people, the priests were the mediators. You would go to the Temple and you would make your offerings and the priests were the go-betweens; they were the ones that were the representatives—the mediators—that stood before God and the people and what we learn in this portion is that Korah learned very clearly that you cannot approach God without a proper mediator. And if you haven't read the story, I would encourage you to at least read Chapter 16 in its entirety because there were 250 + men that were devoured by God for trying to stand as mediators that were in a position that they were not supposed to be in. You see when God speaks, He means it. When God speaks, He means it!
 
And that's a message that America needs to hear. The message that America needs to hear is that when God speaks, He means it. When He tells us the direction that we need to go to walk towards righteousness and to walk towards holiness—to be disciples of Him—to be conformed to His Image because when God says it, He means it!  That's why Jesus said 'There will come a time when many will say to me, and many will proclaim to me, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we do this and didn't we do that; didn't we go to church and didn't we serve communion and didn't we teach Bible School and didn't we do this and didn't we do that?' and I will look at them and say, I never knew you—away from me.'  Now we all fall short. Just because I'm a preacher or just because you claim to be a Christian and just because I claim to be a Christian doesn't mean that we're sinless; it doesn't mean that we stumble, but we do not have the right to re-write what God has said. We don't have the right to re-write it and put it into our context to where it makes sense to us to make our lives easier.
 
God is serious about His Word as Korah found out and there are heavy consequences. And I don't have time to discuss it because I'm abbreviating my message today because I really wanted to hear from our students that went on the CIY MOVE trip this past week, but if you read this out to its fullness, these guys end up in shole. Do a study on that.
 
And that brings us to Jesus. In 1 Timothy 2:5 (JR read it.)  Paul says that there is one mediator—that was the death that Adam talked about that He comes one time to die for the sins of everyone. There is one mediator—do you know when I pray, why do I say 'In the Name of Jesus?' Why? Because He is my mediator. He is the one that stands before God and me; if I go like Korah and try to stand in before God on my own, I will be consumed because I am a sinful man! And I need one who will stand on my behalf.
 
In Hebrews 9:15, the writer of Hebrews says (JR read it.) Jesus died to be my mediator. Friends, America needs a mediator; America needs a mediator. We don't need better police officers as we already have a lot of great police officers. We don't need better Presidents in the sense of they are going to solve our problems. We don't need better governors and mayors and everything else down the line if it's the mindset that they're going to solve our problems because they are NOT going to solve our problems. These problems are way bigger than any human who stands on the earth today. The issues that we have are issues of the human heart; the issues that we have are that we are a people who believe lies. We believe lies and one of the lies we believe is that we don't take God at His Word. Often times we water it down and make Him this big loving teddy bear in the sky and as long as I claim His grace, everything's fine, but you know what? God is a God of judgment! And judgement is a form of love. You show me a parent who does not bring judgment upon their children when they're out of line, I will show you a parent who does not truly love their child. And this does anger me. It does anger me that our country—that our people—that our church abroad is so flippant with the Word of God. It does bother me and we had better wake up, America. If we think these are dark days—if we don't get it figured out and get on our knees and turn to the One who can solve our problems—if we think these are dark days, just wait, because mankind has already proven that we can't handle ourselves. It gets progressively worse.
 
Anybody in here fearful for your grandchildren? Anybody in here fearful for your children? It is a war zone; it is a WAR ZONE. And the church needs to stand up—the church needs to rise up—the church needs to quit talking about it—the church needs to quit acting and the church needs to start following.
 
I think it was in Chapter 17 Moses was so incensed he tells them to each bring a staff from the 12 tribes so they bring them in and nothing happens except to Aaron's staff and Aaron's staff blooms and begins to produce almonds. I will tell you in short form and you can go and do your own research and study that as Moses stood in the desert and needed proof and an indication that he was following God and that he was in his right place as he was being persecuted by the spiritual leaders of Israel, so Jesus as He stood being persecuted by the spiritual leaders of Israel, was nailed to a tree and that tree bloomed when He walked out of a tomb as the proof and the evidence that He was a prophet like Moses.
 
Roughly 15 years ago we were getting ready to go to CIY MOVE Conference. We had spent a day in Philadelphia on the 4th of July—a pretty cool place to spend the 4th of July, in Philadelphia, and we were headed back toward Lancaster, Pennsylvania, headed west on Highway 30. We had been out there the year before or maybe a couple years before and had made the same trek being out in the middle of Amish country—it was beautiful country out there—we had been in New York City two days before that and then we were in Philadelphia on the 4th; we were hot and we were tired and just worn out and we're driving and riding in a couple of vans headed back towards Lancaster and I look up as I am driving the lead van—this story is not going to go well from this point on—I am driving in the lead van and we're just sitting and talking and I'm pretty sure I was talking to Bryan Grinstead at the moment and I looked up and I saw a sign that said ""Wilmington, 11 miles,"" and I kept driving and about 2 miles later, all of a sudden I thought, ""Wilmington?"" We're not going through any ""Wilmington,"" and then I realized the sign was announcing ""Wilmington, Delaware.""  It wasn't near what I had expected nor wanted to see. Somehow we had gone from Highway 30 West to Highway 202 South and we are about to get to Delaware. So we pull over into a gas station and if anybody knows my pet peeves—one of them is backtracking—and the other one is losing things; I can't stand either one of those—they both drive me crazy, so I pull into this gas station. You have to realize this is before GPS and all the fancy technology we have now and I'm telling Bryan and the other van members, 'I have to get this figured out.' So I'm looking at maps and where we are and where we're supposed to be and I'm not going to tell you what was going through my mind because I knew that if I hadn't of taken a wrong turn that at any moment I would be in a cool air-conditioned dorm room way from all of these teenagers for just a few minutes. But I'd been locked in this van with them—did I mention that the van that I was driving was the one where the air-conditioning was not working and it was about 95 degrees outside?
 
You had better make sure that the person you are following is going the right direction or you will end up in the wrong place every single time. JESUS IS GOING THE RIGHT DIRECTION; WILL YOU FOLLOW HIM? Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Abba, thank you for your forgiveness. It is only through your forgiveness that we have the ability to follow you. Lord, I thank you that our young people spent this past week at the CIY event, and I thank you for the leaders and adults that spent their time, who invested their time with these young lives, Lord, helping to teach them that Jesus is the one to follow. Lord, I just pray that you continue to work on our nation; we are a nation at war, but it is not a war of flesh and blood even though if you watch TV, it sure looks as if it is. Lord, it is a spiritual war and the enemy is Satan who comes to steal, to kill and to destroy and there are days that it seems like he is overwhelmingly winning the battle. God, I pray that you would rise up an army that would drop to their knees and that they would pray and that they would seek you and that they wouldn't pray for other people to change but Lord that we would pray that we would change and that as we change, Lord that you would bring others along. God, I thank you for the work that is being done within this church in the lives of people—Lord, I know, because I've seen it for the last few weeks and as I told Craig the other day, I just sense a boiling within people—of you moving in people's lives, but with that comes adversity and with that comes opposition so God I pray that we would be strong and that we would be focused, and I pray Lord, that we would learn a lesson from the Israelites that often times the destruction of a nation and the destruction of an assembly of people comes not from without, but from within. So God, I pray that we might be unified in our love and desire to follow Jesus. God, I pray that if there is anyone else here today who needs to make a decision, whether it be a decision to repent from a direction they were going, to repent from things stored up in the heart, to repent of sin, to be baptized—there is no reason we can't do that right now; we are going to have several at the beginning of the next service, so there's no reason we can't do some right now. God, whatever it is that you want to work in our hearts, I pray that you would work—that your Spirit would work and that we would not impede. Lord, thank you for Jesus' love, His forgiveness—His grace, and it's in His Name that we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",7/10/2016,
"We probably think of our country's independence as being gained through the armed struggle and our ability to defeat other countries we've fought at different points over the last 240 years. We won because we were tougher! We won because we wanted it more than those we fought against. We won because we refused to surrender. The Declaration of Independence says we have the rights to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness . . . .' But where have these pursuits taken us?
 
If I celebrate freedom, but I'm still enslaved to addiction, am I free? Jesus replied, ""Very truly I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.""  Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed! 
 
If I celebrate independence, but I depend on the things of this world to bring me joy, am I free? In Mark 8, Jesus asked ""What good is it for someone to gain the whole world, yet forfeit their soul?"" If I celebrate liberty, but I'm still chained to my past, am I free? 2 Corinthians 5 Paul adds ""Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: the old is gone, the new is here!""
 
Jesus says ""Celebrate freedom in me. Through my death and resurrection, the world will celebrate true life and liberty. Through my death and resurrection the world will have the chance to choose to become free. Through my death and resurrection generations from now, boys and girls, men and women, in bondage to the desires of the world, can throw off those handcuffs and become free through me. I HAVE WON!""  As we celebrate Christ's last meal with His disciples, let's remember it as Christ's surrender ultimately leading to His victory and our freedom.
 
Prayer: God, make us in awe as we think about how the greatest victory in the world was brought about by your Son's surrender and how He alone can give us life, liberty, and happiness. Amen.
 
(JR gave today's message.)
 
Today's Torah portion is Numbers 13:1 – 15:41. This contains one of the most famous stories from the wandering. Really, when we think of the Israelites wandering in the wilderness, this is the story often times that pops into our minds and it's ironic or God's plan that it is on this day because I think it's interesting that this was their opportunity to have a land of dependence. I say that because they weren't a people who were looking for independence. They were a people who needed dependence. They had come to the threshold of a land where God was sending them and if things would have gone the way God had wanted them to go, they would have gone into the land totally dependent upon Him—totally submissive to His will. And there's a degree in America probably to where we need to sit back and evaluate our independence. I understand what the independence is all about—we don't want to be a people totally independent. We want to be a people who are in submission to God. We want to be a people who are following Him. But the reality is today that we in America don't want to be that. We don't want to be a people following God. We don't want to be a people chasing after His desires and His dreams and because of that we look around and we have what we have. We have what we have—there is a lot of good but there is a lot of turmoil, too.
 
So we get to Numbers 13 and today I probably want to surf a little more in the passage than what I've been doing in previous weeks. Starting in Numbers 13:1 it says: (JR read Verses 1-2.) That's what Shelach (this week's Torah portion) means:  send some men or sent ones. (JR continued reading Verses 3-4.) Then it goes on and it lists the names. Now notice that when we get to the end of this story—you'll remember it from a famous children's song—""10 were bad; 2 were good,"" but it's interesting in this story that God lists all the names. They are all given the opportunity to have their names recorded in history as people of faith but because they were not people of faith, 10 of their names go down recorded in history. You know there are some places we don't know the names. You remember back in the story of Lot when he was rescued out of Sodom, she was called just ""Lot's wife."" We don't even know her name. There are different places where the names aren't mentioned, but here the names are mentioned. I say that because when I think about this, I think about it in terms of modern day. The Scriptures are still being written, maybe not in written form the way we read it today, but God is not interested in just being a God of history, as in past. God is a God interested in writing His story in your life today. So when I think about this, sometimes it brings a little bit and I don't know if ""fear"" is the right word but maybe a little bit of trepidation on the idea of my name could go down for all history to see as one who did not trust God. ""10 were bad; 2 were good."" Another thing that communicates to me is that the overwhelming percentage didn't. Jesus said similar things to that: ""Enter through the narrow gate, for broad is the gate and wide is the road that leads to destruction and many will walk down that path. But narrow the gate and small is the path that leads to eternal life and only a few will find that."" Sometimes I think about the church and I think about the 12 spies that were sent out who were men of faith supposedly. They wouldn't have been chosen—they wouldn't have been selected if they weren't in that position or if they hadn't been thought of in that way, but yet 10 of the 12 failed. If we were to use those same kinds of numbers and take this room, for example, how many of us would actually walk the narrow path?—how many of us would actually come back with a good solid report? I'm not saying that the numbers would be exactly the same here; I'm just saying my mind thinks on these things. These were people in a position they thought could be trusted to chase God, but yet 10 of the 12 failed—10 of the 12 weren't positionally where they needed to be and their names are recorded. In Verses 16-20 it goes on to say this: (JR read them.) And so they were given instructions he sends them out; Moses gave them the vision. Now here's the thing: I don't believe that Moses ever sent them in with the intent of asking the question of 'should we take the land?' Why do I not believe that was really the intent of sending them in there? Because God had already told them what?—that He was giving it to them—that He was sending them in there. This was not a committee sent in to determine the likelihood of success; this was a group of people or leaders who was supposed to come back with a report of how good it was going to be once they were successful. But it doesn't really unfold this way.
 
'Sent ones'—that's what they were. The word in the Hebrew—Shelach—is the exact same word that translates over into the Greek for ""apostle."" Apostle means ""sent one."" In a true sense you could say Moses didn't send spies into the land; he sent 'apostles,' because once they were sent, they became apostles. Moses, the first redeemer, sent apostles into the Promised Land to check it out. Let's turn to Matthew 10 for a minute. In Matthew 10 we find the story of the Second Redeemer, Jesus. Moses, as we've talked about for weeks and weeks here of being the first redeemer of the people of God, gives way and he prophesied that there would come a prophet like himself that would do things like himself; we've talked about different things that Jesus did: His bursting on the scene, His first miracle was changing water into wine, the same way that Moses in his first big miracle changed water to blood. Here is Jesus in Matthew 10 and it says this: (JR read Matthew 10:1.) Now who did He call? It says He called His 12 disciples to Him. In Verse 2 it says ""These are the names of the 12 apostles,""—what's the difference? Why does the Bible use different words here? Disciples are ""servants;"" apostles are ""sent ones."" What is Jesus doing in this passage? (JR continued reading Matthew 10:2-7.) I would testify to you that if you would go through Matthew 10 and Numbers 13 you would find a ton of parallels between these two groups. Moses got to the edge of the Promised Land and he sent in 12 apostles—he sent in 12 spies—he sent in 12 'sent out ones' into the land, to survey the land, to check it out and to bring back a message in the same way the Second Redeemer was already there living in the land and He sent out 12 apostles—12 'sent ones' into the land with the specifics they were to remain in the land and to only go to the lost sheep of Israel and not to the Gentiles—that there was a specific mission. Jesus sent His men out in pairs. You know what the sages and rabbis teach about the 12 spies that were sent out by Moses? The traditions teach that they went in pairs—that they were paired up; pretty much across the board, the Jewish position on that is that Moses sent them out 2 by 2 by 2 by 2 by 2. The fate of both generations—the generation of Moses—the generation of Jesus—the fate of both generations hung on the success of the missions, the missions that the 12 were sent out to do. I encourage you to make that a study this week and look at the parallels between Matthew 10 and Numbers 13. I wish I had more time to spend on that today, but I don't so we are now going back to Numbers 13.
 
They are sent out; they're given specific instructions. Verse 25 says: (JR read it and then he began reading Verses 26-29.) Did you hear what happened there? It kind of flows the way sometimes we talk but they gave Moses this account in Verse 27. (JR repeated Verse 27.) It's exactly the way that you said it was going to be; it's exactly what God said it was going to be—it's the portrait of our dreams, but.  But what? But what? What if we inserted but into other Bible stories? What if we inserted but into just the story of Jesus? He came, He was born in Bethlehem; He was raised in Nazareth, He lived a perfect life, He looked around and He indeed did see sinful man. He saw mankind in need of a Savior and He knew He was the possibility of fulfilling that role, but, He decided to go on vacation. Do you understand what I'm asking there? Do you understand that process? Where does but ever come into it? There was no but that entered Jesus' mind. When He got to this point coming to earth from Heaven, He was on a mission. He was an ""apostle"" in a sense. He had been sent by God to fulfill a mission and there was going to be no 3-letter but get in His way. Why do we so often go to the but? Yeah, I really believe that God is calling me to do this—God has laid this on my heart, but. But I don't have the time, but I don't have the money, but I don't this, but I don't that . . . .  I would really like to intervene and help that family but it's too much of an emotional investment. I would really love to reach out and help those children—those kids—but, too little time. If the world that claims to be following Jesus could just erase the ""buts"". . . .  It says in Verse 30—Caleb was one of the spies—one of the apostles—one of the sent ones. (JR read it.) What do you mean? Caleb saw the exact same thing that the others saw. He and Joshua saw the exact same things that the other 10 saw. What was the difference? They had all seen the exact same things but their conclusions were so dramatically different. (JR then read Verse 31.) David journeyed down through the valley where he saw Goliath opposing the Israelites; he knew someone should do something—God laid it on his heart to do it, but he realized Goliath was so much bigger than he and realized that Goliath was an esteemed warrior, so David turned around and went home. That's how those stories could transpire, when we allow a but to get in the way. David didn't see Goliath—when he saw Goliath he saw who?—he saw God; He saw victory. There are hundreds of soldiers standing around there seeing the exact same thing—Saul himself saw the exact same thing, so why is it that David came to the conclusion that 'it was time to get it on?' He saw that it was time to fight because he saw with different eyes. It wasn't the things he saw that were different; it was the interpretation in his eyes, his mind and in his heart. (JR continued reading Verse 32 and then continued into Numbers 14 paraphrasing 14:1.) ""We don't want to go; don't make us do it—it's too dangerous."" The disciples were sent out as apostles; they heard the voice of Jesus tell them to go. They knew that there was a mission that needed to be done, but, they looked around and saw that He was handing them over as to wolves and it's too dangerous so they decided to go back to their jobs in Galilee fishing. That's how those stories could evolve if we let but get in the way. (JR read Numbers 14:1-2a.)  Do you see what a lack of vision leads to? A lack of vision—a lack of trust in God results in grumbling against God's appointed. When you grumble against Aaron and Moses, ultimately what are you doing? Who put them in those positions? God did! (JR continued reading Numbers 14:2b-3.) Woe is me—woe, woe, woe. Why do we do that? Why do we focus on what seems to be an unsurpassable mountain when we've already come over that mountain? How do we so quickly forget where we've been? I'm speaking of us as Israelites as if we are in this story. Why is this a big deal? Was not the Pharaoh of Egypt a bigger deal when it comes to power? They said, ""Wouldn't it be better for us to go back to Egypt?"" (JR then read Verse 4.) 
 
The New Testament says there will come a time when ""men will not put up with sound doctrine but they will gather around themselves a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear."" Times are no different; we're no different now than they were then. We do the same thing now. We'll surf around and look for a Bible teacher who teaches us what is consistent—and tells us what doesn't ruffle our feathers. 'I want to be happy; I want the happy gospel—I want the happy Jesus. I don't want the one that says there is going to be persecution and pain. I don't want the Jesus of the Bible who said ""when they persecute you, remember they persecuted me first,"" and know this is going to happen if you are really following me.' We don't like that because it doesn't make us comfortable and after all, God is a God of comfort. God is surely the one who helped us create air-conditioning and power windows in our cars cause Heaven forbid, we'd have to crank the window up or down. That's the American God, I mean, He is the God of comfort! We've talked about it before that there is nothing more annoying to our comfort zone than when the remote control does not work. Man, it's like we're in a 3rd world country because the batteries died in the remote control and I don't have any replacements. 'Somebody go down to CVS and get some more batteries.' We get caught up in a world of just wanting to be comfortable and that follows the course, a lot of times, in our theologies. You know, I listen to a lot of Bible teachers that I don't necessarily agree with all the time—do you know why?—because it challenges me and it stimulates me and it makes me go and study because if I don't agree with it and they are using passages, I have to go and I have to wrestle through that. It's a lot easier to just get somebody that I agree with 99% of whatever they say and they can give me a pre-game pep talk, pat me on the back, tell me how good I am and put me in the game.
 
This is one of the most traumatic days in Jewish history. I've spent time on it for today and I have for a reason because this is one of the most traumatic days in Jewish history. Oh, I don't mean just on this day of simple occasion. We've already seen in our Torah study how God tends to do things repeatedly or circularly, over and over and over. This day happened to be the 9th day of Av—Tisha B'Av—it generally comes during our calendar months of July/August. We celebrate Passover and we talk about Passover—the Jews talk about Passover and the great things that have happened on Passover—this day right here with the rejection of God by the Jews of not going into the Promised Land--we look at it and we see how it happened and we see that for 40 years that generation wandered around in the wilderness until they all perished--other than Caleb and Joshua, all the men of fighting age died before they went but we don't see what transpired in the future. Do you realize that it was on this day that Solomon's temple fell to Nebuchadnezzar and they were sent into the wilderness of Babylon; it was also on this exact day that the Jewish Temple Mount and the Temple of Herod fell to Titus of Rome and the Jews were dispersed into the wilderness of the nations—on the exact same day, hundreds of years later, these things evolved. It was on this day in 132 A.D. that 100,000 Jews were killed in a revolt by the Romans; it was on this day that the first crusade was declared by Pope Urban II and in that crusade 1.2 million Jews died. It was on this day—Tisha B'Av, that the Jews were expelled from England. And it was on this day—Tisha B'Av, that the Jews were expelled from France. It was on this day—Tisha B'Av, that the Jews were expelled from Spain. It was on this day that there was the declaration of war for WWI which was a precursor of WWII—really they're kind of one and the same as according to historians, WWII was trying to finish up what WWI had started. During WWII was the Holocaust where 6 million Jews perished. It was on Tisha B'Av, this exact same day, that there was an order for mass deportation from the Warsaw ghetto. Is it coincidental that on the day that God brought His people to the precipice of the Promised Land for them to go and to embrace the land flowing with milk and honey—the place that He had given them—is it a coincidence that on that very day when they rejected God and said, 'No, we will not go' became a day for other events throughout the rest of history?
 
Where have you seen God working in your life?—in your life personally? I want you to take a second and I want you to look back and think about those moments when you have seen God working—those moments when you've seen God's intervention. These could be in job situations, maybe family situations where there was no hope, humanly speaking, and then something changed. Has anybody in here ever seen God work where you just knew it was God as there is no other explanation? We have seen God work and if we would sit here and have individual conversations and those are some of my favorite conversations to have as people tell me their stories and when they tell me their stories, they are so jacked up; they are so excited because they are talking about God's intervention and seeing God working in their lives. 
 
Why is it that we can have Numbers 14:11?  It says this: (JR read it.)  Let me expound upon that a little bit. These same people had been in bondage; they had built bricks and they had been building pyramids; they had been totally in subject to Pharaoh and their lives were in misery. 'They were whining and groaning and complaining to Me to intervene and I did. I did intervene. They watched Me send 10 plagues that destroyed the Egyptians yet didn't even touch them. They watched Me destroy the confidence and the mentality of the Egyptian people. Then we let them out—the death of the firstborn—they hear the wailing and the mourning all over Egypt of the people who lost their children and I lead them out to the edge of the Red Sea where it looks like they're in real trouble; the Red Sea in front of them and the Egyptian Army coming behind them; I split the Sea and I send them through and I close the Sea and destroy the Egyptians. They become thirsty; I give them water. They're hungry, so I give them manna. But they didn't want manna every day.' We did that one last week; grilled cheese again, Mom? 'They were never satisfied; we get to Mount Sinai and they see Me descend upon the mountain—I brought them to the edge of a land that I'm going to send them into and they're worried about the people there.' Their eyes have gone off of God and onto people.
 
Why is it that we have to have a Numbers 14:11?  ""How long will these people treat me with contempt?"" I've already said that they weren't any different in that day than we are in this day and what I would attest to is 'sometimes JR is guilty of the exact same thing.' I've seen God work in my life; I've seen God work in your lives and then God calls me to a new and different challenge and I focus on the obstacles. God forbid! Where does God want you? What new land—what new territory does He want you to charge and take starting today? What new territory does He want you to say, 'Alright, if you're leading me this way, I'm going, regardless of the Nephilim, regardless of how challenging it looks, I'm going to trust.' You see, the bottom line is, if you could go take the land on your own, you don't need God. The whole point of Him bringing them there with giants in the land and everything else, it was to continue the revelation that God is with them. If you wait until all the obstacles are gone, why would you need God? You're sufficient in yourself. So I ask you again—what land has He brought you to that you need to charge into starting today? Is it relationships? Is it ministry? What is it? Because I'll just bet you that if you're a chaser of Jesus, He's making you into an apostle in the sense that He wants to send you out. Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer:  God, thank you; thank you, Lord, for your grace and your mercy. God, there was a group of people who stood literally on the edge of history with a chance to change everything, but they chose to focus on the wrong things.  God, I pray that we would not be that group; I pray, Lord, as you have called us out and many of us claim to be your servants—Lord, I pray, that we would accept the role of apostles in the sense that we are sent out. Lord, I pray that we would not be content to just sit where we are and I certainly pray, Lord that we would not be content to go back to captivity. Lord, any time that dying in captivity looks better than serving you in faith—anytime that looks better then Lord, we have lost our focus. I pray, Lord that you convict our hearts and I pray that we would understand that we cannot do this in and of ourselves because we are sinners; we fall short. If we were perfect, we wouldn't need to be here today. Lord, we come here because we're not good enough; we come here because we're not strong enough. We come here because in Jesus we find the strength. Lord, I thank you for His sacrifice—for Him not allowing the word ""but"" to get in the way and that He saw the need—He had the calling and He charged forward despite the obstacles, that He wasn't worried about a safe place because the cross certainly isn't safe. Lord, I pray that we would be a people that would totally sell out to following you. Lord, we are quick to complain about the communities we live in and about all the bad stuff that happens but yet so often we're slow to charge out into new territory in faith. I pray, Lord, that we do so with reckless abandon—not so that we can be liberated and not so that we can be independent, but because we are dependent.  God, I am so excited about the three baptisms at the beginning of 2nd service. It's exciting to see people surrender. Lord, I pray that if there is anyone in here today that needs to surrender, I pray that it will happen today. Lord, we need new birth and new life and new hope and we find that in Jesus. And it is by faith that we come to you because of your grace, Lord that you've given. It's in Jesus' Name we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",7/3/2016,
"He was born Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmo Tebaldo—I'm glad that's not me. He was born in 1882 in Lugo, Italy. He told the New York Times that he came from a well-to-do family in Parma, Italy. When he was still there he took a job as a postal worker early in life, but then he was soon accepted at the University of Rome La Sapienza. It was in 1903 that he arrived in Boston aboard the S.S. Vancouver; he had a total of $2.51 in his pocket. He set out to learn English and quickly learned the language. The next few years consisted of him doing odd jobs around the East Coast eventually taking the position of a dishwasher in a restaurant where he slept on the floor. He managed to work his way up to a position of waiter but he was fired for shortchanging the customers and for theft. In 1907 he moved to Montreal and became an assistant teller at the Banco Zarossi, a bank that was started by an Italian guy. At one point the bank was in serious financial trouble because of bad real estate loans. The bank owner fled to Mexico with a large portion of the bank's money. (That kind of sounds like modern-day America, doesn't it?) This immigrant stayed in Montreal and lived with the bank owner who skipped town; he lived at his house with his abandoned family helping to take care of them. At one point he walked into a local business office and there was no one there and he happened to find a checkbook and he wrote himself a check for $423.58—not sure why that specific amount, but maybe so it wouldn't look so obvious. When he was confronted by the police for writing a bad check, he stuck his hands out, held out his wrists, and said, ""I'm guilty."" He ended up spending three years at St. Vincent-de-Paul Federal Penitentiary on the outskirts of Montreal. While he was in the penitentiary, rather than inform his mother what had happened, he posted her a letter stating that he had found a job as a ""special assistant"" to a prison warden. In 1911 after his release he decided to return to the United States from Canada, but got involved in a scheme to smuggle Italian illegal immigrants across the border. He was caught and spent two years in Atlanta prison. After his release from prison he made his way back to Boston and there he met Rose Maria Gnecco. He proposed marriage and was married to her in 1918. He then began his own company. It took a few years to dream up his company but he got his company going; it was called the Securities Exchange Company. He set up shop in the Niles Building on School Street in Boston. Word spread about the investments and the things that he was doing and investments came in at a rapid pace. He hired agents and paid them generous commissions for every dollar that they brought in and in 1920 his total take in U.S. money was $5,000. In 2010 that would have been about $54,000. By that next month (March) he had made $30,000—in 2010 that would be $324,000. His business was booming; things were happening rapidly and by May of 1920, just 5 months into his venture, he had made $420,000 and in 2010 terms that would be $4.53 million, but his kingdom began to crash; his investments weren't sustainable.  They weren't what they seemed to be and people began to catch on. He was using new investments to pay off old debts. Things were starting to spiral downhill and on November 1 of that same year (1920) just 11 months later, Charles Ponzi pleaded guilty to multiple charges and faced a lifetime in prison. His investors lost about $20 million in 1920 which was equivalent in 2011 dollars to about $225 million. Charles Ponzi completely annihilated their finances; he became a mentor for many people—he has a great thing named after him—now we call it the ""Ponzi scheme."" What a thing to be known for.
 
I thought about that and thought what if I were to do something like that where generations later it would be known as the ""Moffatt scheme?"" As I was thinking about that this week it just kind of stunned me to think that someone could be in that position. Ponzi spent the last years of his life in poverty; he had gone back to prison; he had actually been released from prison and had gone back to prison after several things had transpired in his life, but he lived his last few years in poverty working occasionally as a translator but his health suffered. He had a heart attack in 1941 which left him considerably weakened. His eyesight began failing, and by 1948, he was almost completely blind. A brain hemorrhage paralyzed his right leg and arm. He died in a charity hospital in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil on January 15, 1949. Soon before his death he was granted one last interview by an American reporter and this is what Charles Ponzi said about his Ponzi scheme. He said, ""Even if they never got anything for it,""—here he was speaking of the people he swindled millions of dollars from—""it was cheap at that price. Without malice aforethought I had given them the best show that was ever staged in their territory since the landing of the Pilgrims! It was easily worth $15 million bucks to watch me put the thing over.""
 
The hardened heart—the hardened heart of a discontented life. American Greed is a television show in its 10th or 11th season. I pulled it up and I looked over the captions of what each show has been about over the last 10 or 11 years and I was astounded at the amount—you know I've seen the show on TV but to just put it in front of your face and read one thing after another after another after another after another of millions and millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars being pilfered off of people--American Greed is the place in which we live. When I looked at it and saw the 10 seasons, I saw dentists and doctors and lawyers and preachers and contractors and artists and real estate investors and Wall Street people and construction companies, etc.,--I mean the list goes on and on and on—it wasn't just one group. One of the things that I noticed is that there seems to be no end to greed. We live in a culture riddled with ""wanting more, wanting more, wanting more."" Another one of the things I noticed, and I know it's not just exclusively true of our culture, but within this show, the vast majority of the stories about American greed were about people who already had stuff. It wasn't about the person who is laying in the gutter and has nothing so went in and was just trying to survive. These stories were about people who wanted more and more and more and more and more.
 
We as a people have a lack of contentment.  We have a lack of contentment problem; we have a lack of contentment crisis in the world in which we live. It's a lack of contentment not just in money and it's easy to focus on that as when we ask if we're content, a lot of times it goes to whether we have enough stuff. But as I thought about the contentment thing this week--I don't have time to go into each of these, but I thought about the fact that we live in a culture that is addicted to experiences. We're addicted to excitement—it's that we want more and more and more and more. I heard a thing yesterday on the radio about whether or not the new movie ""Independence Day—Resurgence"" is worth watching. The original came out roughly 20 years ago starring Will Smith and it would set a new tone and direction for movies of that time and the level of excitement, and the people who were reviewing it said 'Oh, it's same ole, same ole, scream and action excitement.' What they are saying is 'It's a heart problem of Americans and contentment. It's same ole, same ole.'  I'm not saying whether the movie is good, bad, or ugly—I really have no idea, but the tone that I heard was that 'we need more—we need more—we need more—we need more.'
 
I came from two days of basketball camp—I came home last night; that's why I can't hardly talk today—not sure if you can tell, but I can sure tell. And as I was at camp for two days, it's a breeding ground for more and more and more and more and more. Sports, in the culture of the world in which we live, we need more and more and more and more and more. It's not enough that I play 11 months of the year; I play 12 months of the year. It's not enough that I play 12 months of the year—I have to play 13 months of the year—more and more and more and more. What I saw yesterday and what I've seen the last few weeks with kids is that they're just spent. And they don't even know they're spent; they are just spent—they are worn out cause they have done more and more and more and more. Sitting in a doctor's office with my daughter this last week talking about her ankles and some different things to do to strengthen them and he was talking about kids and injuries with kids and how they used to see them in their early 20's and now are seeing these same injuries all the way back to their early mid-teens--the wear and tear and usage because we overdose. That's just who we are as people; we don't do anything small—we supersize everything. Because of our lack of contentment, we are driven for more and more and more. When we are totally stressed out and have come to the end of our ropes—we are maxed out and we've done so much and we've done everything we can do, then with our lack of content, we look at our next door neighbors, who have taken it upon themselves to clear their schedules and to rest, and then we're envious of that. We're envious of their downtime! The real issue is contentment or lack thereof!
 
I would ask that challenging question to you today. Can you honestly sit and look in the mirror this morning—the spiritual mirror of your life and look into the eyes of God and can you say that you're content with life—that you're content with where you are. There are some things that it may not be good to be content with; spiritually maybe, if we're not moving in the direction God wants us to be going, then maybe we shouldn't be content with that, but some of the issues of life are American greed and we have to check ourselves at the door and we have to look in the mirror and we have to survey where we are.
 
Beha'alotcha—that is this week's portion—from Numbers 8:1 to 12:16. I want us to spend just a few minutes here in Numbers 11 which is in the middle of this Torah portion. Now remember the book of Numbers is the book of their wanderings. It's the time after they've left Egypt and the time or the period when they go into the Promised Land. (JR read Numbers 11:1-6.) ""We've never seen anything but this manna! We've never seen anything but this manna!"" Any parents in here who cooked for your kids ever heard that line? 'We never eat anything but this manna—I'm sick and tired of manna.' And that's the mindset. Now the question we have here is when you come out of slavery, wouldn't you just be happy to be free? If you have something to eat, wouldn't you be happy that you're on your way to freedom? But that's the human heart. That's the human heart; we are rebellious by nature—we want to sit on the throne that God sits on. We want to be King; we want to be Queen. Freedom for these people wasn't enough, but I want you to notice something. If you notice in Verse 4, it says ""the rabble with them began to crave other food . . ."" That's what the NIV says; I'm not sure what your version says but the ""rabble"" are people, but do you know who those people are specifically? They are the non-Jews among them. Now, hear this; they are the beneficiaries of God's movement. They are the tag-alongs that came out of Egypt (non-Jews) with the Nation of Israel and we saw earlier in our Torah study that there were other people that came out with the Jews; there were non-Jews that came along with them that are the beneficiaries of the promise. Can you imagine taking someone on vacation with you and your family, paying for the whole thing and having them complain the entire time about where you're staying, about how you're driving, about what exits you take and what you're eating? Would that sit well with you? Would it influence your attitude about life at the moment? I know the way we are; we'd be mumbling under our breath, 'These ungrateful bums,'—which is TRUE! It would be true, but this discontent impacts our hearts—it impacts our souls—those kinds of things, doesn't it? If you're having a great day and you go somewhere and you spend 4 hours locked in a room with a bunch of people who are really having bad days and not afraid to let you know it—what eventually happens to your good day? It's not quite as good—isn't it hard to stay focused because what eventually happens is that they point things out and you look at your good day and the vision of your circumstances change. And instead of seeing 99 positives, we focus on 1 negative—they are able to stir that up.
 
The 'rabble amongst them started to complain about the food that they got. You know what the New Testament says about this kind of thing? Do you know what Paul says about this?  He said, ""Bad company corrupts good character."" God addresses this a lot with the Israelites all throughout the Scriptures—about who they should marry and who they shouldn't marry and the reasons why, because if you are unequally yoked; if you don't have the same calling—the same vision—eventually, the majority of the time, according to God, the negative wins. And so here, the grumblers and the complainers—they are the beneficiaries—they're the ones that are tagging along. They should be the most grateful that they get to be included in the blessing of Israel, but the beginnings of the discontentment of the Nation are sewn probably from a place that should have been ignored but it's not that easy. It's not that easy to ignore; it's not that easy to be content; it's not easy to be content in the world in which we live in—the world of obesity and excess and I'm not talking about body weight—I'm talking about everything we do. We are on hyper drive in America with everything—I said before we supersize everything; everything has to be better. Everything has to stimulate me more. But this is not new; this is not new. Discontentment goes back years and we'll read soon if we are to continue this study of the Old Testament when we get to the book of Joshua which is just a couple of books later—we get to the book of Joshua in Chapters 6-7 and we find the story of Achan. Here we find the story of when God tells the Israelites, some 40 years later from what we're currently reading, as they go into the Promised Land that they are to take Jericho and He mandated the things they were supposed to do; they were supposed to give some things to God and destroy everything else but Achan had a better idea, so he takes some of it and puts it in his own tent and hides and stashes it away. Do you know why? Because for whatever reason in his life, he was not content to trust God. He wasn't content with what he had.
 
American greed always comes from a lack of contentment. If we are content, we don't need any excess—right? We don't need more and more and more, and as we read the story, we find out that when they went to fight the next city of Ai, some Israeli soldiers lost their lives, which means kids lost their fathers and it was all tracked back to God's punishment to the Nation because of one man's discontentment--because of Achan's unwillingness to trust in God. God had said, 'This is the plan; this is the idea and this is what I want you to do,' but because Achan deviated from God's plan, children lost their fathers.
 
These kinds of things—they are scary to me because I start having to ask the hard question to myself, ""Who have lost fathers because of the lack of contentment in my own life?"" Now that's a pretty deep question to think through and ponder. Where are the areas of my life where I have not trusted God—where I have not been content?—and because of that, it changed a direction. You know, those are deep things. If I decide today to go to lunch in Tipton or to go to Noblesville—those two choices change my life—they alter my life; they alter the timing of everything today—they alter the people I come in contact with; they may not always be life-altering in huge proportions where people die, but they could. It's not the question of whether or not someone may die physically because JR did not trust God and was not content with where God was leading him in life, but did people die spiritually? That's even more dangerous. That's even more dangerous and that's even scarier to me as the one who stands up here and tries to teach and spiritually lead this in this family. It's a scary thing to me to think are there times in my life where I was not content and didn't chase God the way I should have that eventually it led to ripple effects of people dying spiritually that I don't even know about—that I won't even know about until later—to where if God could sit down with me today and say, 'Hey, look, there was one phase of your life where you were not trusting and content with me and my direction, and if you would have been, look what would have happened—this is how life would have evolved and this is the impact that you would have had.' Do you understand where I'm going there? Those are scary things to me. The good thing is it keeps me grounded in my humanity and it reminds me that I'm not Jesus. That's pretty easy for me to realize I'm not Jesus, but if there are ever those times when I'm thinking I need to sit in His seat, those are pretty easy things for me to go back to and realize I'm not Him.
 
Craig spoke today in his communion meditation about the story of the prodigal son going to his father and saying, 'I want my inheritance now,'—why?--because at some level, he was discontented. He was not content with where his life was at that moment and 'I want it now, now, now, more, bigger, supersize me now, Dad.' And that's life; it's not just an American thing—it's a human thing; it's a people thing; it's not just a guy thing. It's not a girl thing. It's an all of us thing. 
 
The Apostle Paul talks about this in Philippians 4—one of the most famous passages on being content. Starting in Verse 10, it says this. (JR read Verses 10-13.) That last verse is so very famous and many take it out of context. ""I can do all things in Him who gives me strength."" How hard is it to be content? Honestly, how many of you struggle with being content? I mean there are all areas of life where we are uneasy with situations. It's hard to be in that place where Paul is. I think about that phrase 'I've learned to be content in every situation.' When you read that, you think 'Well he must have had life pretty easy. He hasn't faced what I've faced. If Paul had faced what I have faced, then he wouldn't be so quick to say 'I can be content in every situation.' Well, listen to what he says in 2 Corinthians 11:21-29. Paul says this: (JR read through Verse 24 repeating Verse 24 twice.) Five times for his faith—for his trust in Jesus—5 times--do you know why they phrase it 40 lashes minus 1? They called it that because a man couldn't live through 40 so we are going to beat him within one stroke of his life—5 times Paul received 40 lashes minus 1. (JR continued reading Verses 25 through 29.) Can you imagine sitting down face to face with Paul and telling him that you did not live Jesus in your workplace because you were afraid they were going to make fun of you? Could you even get those words out to this man after that list? Read the book of Acts; you'll see those things where they happen. Paul said, 'I have learned to be content in all situations.' How are you content when for the 4th time you are beaten within 1 stroke of your life? How would you be content with that? I don't know and I don't claim to have the answer to that. I mean I know what the answer is intellectually—the answer is because you are connected to God and through the Holy Spirit God gives you that peace to be content.  I understand that, but to flesh that out and to actually be content as I'm being strapped to a pole and beaten by rods—I've never had to experience that—but in my mind, it's hard to wrap my mind around that and how one could be content with that. I know in Acts 16 there is a cool story in the life of Paul and Silas when they were sitting in prison. They were sitting in prison in Philippi where he wrote the book of Philippians or who he wrote the book of Philippians to. He was sitting there in the middle of the night giving praise to God in worship and God sets him free by earthquake. God sets him free when he's sitting in that prison and you know what? He demonstrated that he was content in all situations because though he was set free, he stayed there in the jail cell. He never moved; when the jailer lifted the sword to take his own life because he thought his prisoners had escaped, Paul said in the darkness, 'Don't harm yourself; we're all here.' Contentment saved that man's life—the contentment of Paul saved that Philippian jailer's life.  We know he had a family because a few verses later, the jailer asked, 'Sirs, what is it that I must do to be saved?' After Paul told him, the jailer and all of his household were mikvahed—they were immersed—they were baptized.
 
When and where is God going to use your contentment to save a life? Do the people at your work; do the people at your school—do the people around you need to see more of the pursuit and the stress of the American dream or do they need to see contentment with where God has led you in life and peace with God?
Paul learned from Jesus; Paul learned from the Master, the Model, of contentment. The world was at the fingertips of Jesus. The world was right in front of him but yet He didn't grab hold of it. When He was tempted and Satan took Him up on the mountain and said, 'All these kingdoms I will give you if you bow down and worship me,' but Jesus was content to continue His pursuit to walk to the cross to die for you.
 
Now what does this Torah portion have to do with Jesus? In John 6:51 Jesus said, ""I am the Living Bread that came down out of Heaven."" Jesus said, ""I am the Living Manna—I am the Manna."" And just as the generation in the wilderness rejected manna, so the generation of the Master rejected Him. Just as the generation who wandered in the wilderness rejected God and His gift of the manna, so the generation of Jesus rejected the gift of the Living, true Manna that He had given to them. That leads to this question: What about this generation? What will we do with the Living Manna? What will you do with the Living Manna? The bottom line for this Torah portion is God gave them everything they needed; He just didn't give them everything they wanted. Are you content in your prayer life to say 'God, give me enough; give me what I need. Give me what I need to be the best dad I can be. Give me what I need to be the best mom I can be. Give me what I need to be the best son or daughter or grandparent that I can be. Give me what I need to be the best preacher, teacher, student, secretary that I can be.'  A lack of contentment ultimately is a lack of trust. There's nothing harder, and I shared a little bit of this last week—there's nothing harder to be in the midst of a crisis—when Leigh Ann and I were steeped in the middle of infertility, there's nothing harder than to pray the prayer 'God, just help me to be content with what you're doing in our lives'--because what you want is so consuming. What will you do with the Living Manna of God? Do you inadvertently speak and say, 'I'm tired of this manna; I'm tired of this Jesus; I'm tired of this faith,' or do you trust? These are hard questions, I think.  I think they're hard and I think the older I get, the harder they get. Oh, when I was younger and had my whole life in front of me, I didn't think quite as seriously about this stuff. What say you? Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Abba, thank you; thank you for loving us and embracing us. Lord, I thank you that Jesus was the epitome of contentment. He was content to be a homeless man. He was content to be wrongly accused and He was content to offer Himself up on a cross. God, we fight—we fight in being content with manna. We look around us and see that everybody around us seems to have everything and we can't keep up with bills. We look around and see our friends get to go places on Spring Break and I got to sit in the house. We look around and we see and we see and we see and it leads often times to discontentment. God, I pray that you give us spiritual eyes to see what we do have and quit looking at what we don't have. God, I pray that as we look at what we do have, I pray that many times you send people into our lives that intersect our lives and they are a great blessing to us; they watch our children when we don't have the finances to put them in childcare; they give us a job doing extra things when we need money to pay bills; they lend an ear of encouragement and maybe they don't even know that we needed it on that particular day or occasion.  Lord, I pray that we would see these blessings and understand that you send manna from Heaven; it may not be what we always want, but Lord, help us to trust you that it is what we need. God, I pray that if there is anyone in here today who needs to trust the Master, who needs to surrender to Jesus, Lord, I pray that they would find peace—that they would find Shalom in that direction and understand Lord, that true peace doesn't happen apart from Jesus. We can have the absence of conflict but that's not true peace. God, I pray that you transform us. In Jesus' Name, Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",6/26/2016,
"You know that there's nothing you can do as a father, I don't believe, that's better than what Jack said, and that's ""chasing God,"" even if it is into what is perceived dangerous places. There is no better example that we can leave our children than that—than to pursue God with a reckless abandon. You know who ever dreamed this American dream, this American Christianity dream, that 'following Jesus is safe,' hasn't read the Bible. The Bible is a dangerous book in that a lot of people that we read about—a lot of our heroes—were in very, very perilous situations and not in places where we would necessarily encourage our kids to go, because when we encourage our kids, we tend to encourage them towards safety and not necessarily towards faith and a calling and where God has called us to be.
 
It was in 1968 when James Reddick, a dentist, and I believe he was from Seattle; he was 51 years old and he was climbing Mt. Rainier in Washington with two of his children. (He had two others that he left home with his wife.) His daughter, Sharon, was 12 and his son, David, was 11 and they were headed towards the 10,000-foot camp named Camp Muir but before they could get there at about 9,000 feet, they got caught in a bad storm--a very much anticipated situation they found themselves in.  James Reddick proceeded to dig a snow cave in the side of the hill; he got his kids into the snow cave that he dug and got them into their sleeping bags and then he himself became the door. He lay in the doorway of the snow cave with his back to the outside as best he could to plug up the hole to shield them from 55 mph winds and heavy snowfall. When the rescue people came, the two kids were alive but James Reddick had perished. Upon talking to the children about what had happened, they told them the story about how their father had dug the snow cave and how he had plugged the hole with his own body to provide them safety. The children said all the way to the very end, 'Dad was cheerful'—that he was positive—that 'he was giving us hope,' and that he was singing songs and that he was quoting Bible verses.
 
I was thinking about that story and I was thinking about being a good, good father. I was thinking about what it would be for those children to know that their dad physically gave his life and that with his last breaths he was speaking the faith of God. I wondered what kind of impression it would make.
 
In 2008 on the same mountain, Eduard Burceag, on Mt. Rainier, gave his life in much the same way for his wife. They also had another individual with them but Eduard basically plugged a hole in the same way and refused to move—he refused to rotate and take turns and while they were laying there, he told his wife, 'Our children are going to need you.' It was about his children that he gave his life. We live in a world where kids need the blessing from a father. We live in a world where kids need the blessing of a father and it's not just the current world as it's always been this way. But in today's culture, especially in America, I look around and I see it as there has been no more of a pressing time that it has become glaringly obvious that kids need the blessing of a good father. As we see the world around us seemingly disintegrate—as we look around and we see tragedy after tragedy, I truly believe that a lot of the root cause of that is the disintegration of the family. It's the disintegration of the family; it's the disintegration of having the role model. It's the disintegration of not having that person walking out front and leading. All you have to do to see it really, really, really clearly is to walk into our inner cities and when you walk into our inner cities, you see case after case after case of absent fathers and then you see girls that are running to find the love that they don't have from an absent father to another guy who then becomes a father, who then leaves, and we repeat the cycle over and over and over and over. We need the blessing of a father in our culture today but it's hard because quite honestly, just like I said, fathers aren't always around. Mother's Day and Father's Day are hard; I just think they're hard days; there are blessings to those whose lives are seemingly perfect, but in so many other ways, they're very difficult. You heard Missy stand up here and speak just a little bit ago about her difficulty of having an identity in herself; I didn't have any idea she was going to say that stuff today, but it was exactly what I'm talking about, and it's exactly the conversation I had with someone this past week who just sat and talked about having absent parents as a teenager—absent parents because both parents are alcoholics, where there were periods of days at a time where parents had no idea where this individual was.
 
I look around and think how happy Father's Day is for some people but how painful it is for others. The pain of Father's Day and Mother's Day is very vivid for those who have struggled with infertility. I've shared before that Mother's Day was a day that my wife just totally quit coming to church. She just couldn't handle it; it was just too painful to come to church on Mother's Day. It was something she desired to be, but yet for whatever reason at that point, it didn't seem like God was leading us there. For so many people, Father's Day and Mother's Day is representation of pain. It's representation of pain because of children they wish they had, or it's representation of pain because there is the absence of a mother or father who they wished that they had. It's the result of a broken world; we live in a broken world—we live in a place where Satan knows just—I think it was last week that I shared and talked about the fact—I think I was even more clear in 2nd service than I was in 1st service, but Satan, he is at war with God. He is at war with God and he knows the way to hurt God is to hurt you. Satan is not so much at war with us as he is at war with God, and God loves His children, so Satan knows that the more pain he can inflict upon God's children, the more he thinks he is winning the battle. He's really not, but he thinks he is. Satan knows that through the destruction of the family, he can blow up the family so he can blow up people's lives. We know that John 10:10 says that Satan, the adversary, comes only to steal, to kill and to destroy—to kill and destroy everything that God would like—everything that God would smile upon.
 
We need the blessing of a father, but the problem is that they are not always around. Quite frankly we can't solve that situation for some of you in here. Maybe your fathers have already passed away or maybe your fathers have separated themselves from you physically to where there is no contact; maybe your fathers have separated themselves from you emotionally though physically they're around, but they're really not. We can't always solve this problem because fathers aren't frankly what we need to be. Because we live in a broken world, we fathers, I think that we really struggle and that's one of those things I had in that conversation this past week. I said, 'It's really, really difficult in today's world for a lot of fathers to know what to do, where to go, as far as leadership because the world is so broken and so battered, they may not have had any examples, and so we're kind of flying by the seat of our pants putting one foot in front of the other hoping that we end up in a good destination. Maybe there are aspects to it that we get figured out but there are other parts that we don't comprehend. Maybe we're pretty good at the emotional part of it but maybe we're not very good at the spiritual part of it. Or maybe we're good at the spiritual part of it but these other things we're just not good at and that's part of the result of living in a broken world.
 
Earthly fathers are human—we are human and because we're human we're not perfect. That doesn't stop the fact that we have a perfect Savior. We have a perfect example—that we as fathers—we as parents in general, and I speak to women here, too, because there are many of us who play dual roles; there are many of us who play the role of Mom and Dad in a lot of different ways. And I'm here to tell you today is that what we need is to have a pursuit of Jesus; we need to be in all out—full out pursuit of Jesus in that mindset of Doug Harrold of being more afraid of not doing what God has called him to do than I am afraid of putting myself in a physical situation, and that's what we need to pursue as people.
 
Today's Torah portion is Nasso; it is Numbers 4:21 through Numbers 7:89 but we are going to look today at Chapter 6, which is a small, little portion called the ""Aaronic blessing."" It's a blessing that many of you are familiar with; we pray this in here from time to time. It starts in Numbers 6:22-27. (JR read the passage.) ""So they will put my name on the Israelites and I will bless them."" Just a couple of things about the ""Aaronic blessing."" Aaron was the priest who stood in front of the Israelites--between the Israelites and God and God tells them—He instructs them and through Jewish tradition in other places, we see that when they would pronounce this blessing, they would lift up their hands—the priests would lift up their hands above the Israelites and we've seen this repeated over and over and over in the book of Leviticus. Remember in the book of Leviticus, they would bring their sacrifices and they would take their hands and they would place them on the sacrifices to transfer something and Aaron would stand in front of the whole congregation of the Israelites and he would lift up his hands over them. What I just did here was a Jewish tradition. If you've never heard this before google Leonard Nimoy and the Aaronic blessing and watch it. Leonard Nimoy was a Jewish man who passed away not long ago and he tells about a time when he was a kid in the synagogue and they were getting ready for the Aaronic blessing and he peeked—you see when they do the Aaronic blessing, the tradition is that they keep their heads down and they don't look and the tradition of it is that God would, through their hands—sometimes the priests' hands would glow and I'm not worried about all that because a lot of that is just traditional talk but there is a degree to where the hands being over the people is being representative of like a hen putting her wings over her chicks, and Leonard Nimoy tells the story of being in that synagogue and he was peeking and he was scared to peek because he wasn't sure what would happen to him if he actually saw something and how that evolved into the sign for Star Trek and how that came about. It's interesting—there is a picture right back here on our wall so as you leave today look at this picture. Not very many people realize but you'll see that Jesus, in this picture, is doing the same thing. You don't see that very often but it's a very Jewish thing that He is doing in that painted picture back there. The rabbis refer to the Aaronic blessing as ""the lifting of hands."" It's the lifting of hands because it is the representation of God standing over the people asking His blessing.
 
I heard Rabbi Jeff Adler talking on this one time; it was really, really cool and I wish I could just have him here to explain this but what he said is in the original Hebrew the way that it's written, when they would raise their hands above the congregation, it wasn't a congregational blessing—it was an individual blessing with the congregation present, and that it was very personal—it was very singular that when this took place, this was about you. This was God connecting with you in this blessing. ""May the Lord bless you and protect you and may the Lord make His Face shine upon you and be gracious to you; may the Lord show you His favor and give you His Shalom.""
 
A couple of words on this blessing. ""May the Lord bless you . . . .""—we find in Ephesians 1:3 that we find every blessing of God in Jesus. We find that Jesus literally is the fulfillment of the Aaronic blessing and that in every one of these statements in here, Jesus personified—Jesus lived it out—Jesus connected with people through them. In Romans 5:1 we find that we have peace with God through Jesus. Jesus said, ""My peace I leave you; my peace I give you."" In Colossians 3:15 he says ""Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts . . . .""
 
""May the Lord bless you and protect you; may the Lord make His Face shine upon you and be gracious to you; may the Lord show you His favor and give you His Shalom. So they will put my name on the Israelites and I will bless them."" They will put on my Name. You know as much as we need the blessing of a father in America, we need the blessing of our Heavenly Father worse. You know I struggle with this cultural vacuum because it seems like more and more and more and more people come to me with questions that I don't have answers for because they are answers I cannot control. You know I like the questions when someone comes and says 'Where is that verse ""For God so Loved the World . . . .?""—well I can find that but when someone says 'I need a father because mine won't speak to me,' I feel helpless. Why? Because I am helpless. There isn't really anything I can do about that. The only thing I can do personally about that is to try and fill in the gap a little bit—to try and be a good example—to try to be an encourager. Missy said something a little while ago that was really profound and that Charlie Gerber taught me years and years ago and it jumps out at me every time I hear it. It is that our same-sex parent is our role model parent; our opposite sex parent is our esteem builder parent. And Missy stood here and talked about how she struggled in the absence of a good, good father to feel any self-worth.
 
You know we need people like you to have eyes and ears to see and hear to step in the gap for others, to be an encourager. Until that day when the Prophet Isaiah, speaking on behalf of God, gave us this promise about Jesus. (JR read Isaiah 9:7.)  We long for those days for that passage to be fulfilled. We long for those days when Jesus will sit on the throne of David—a throne that really belongs to Him because He is the true King of Israel. And the world will then experience peace for the first time—not just the glimpse of peace that we have now, because that's what we have now. Each of us, no matter how close we get to God or no matter how much we chase God, we live in a world of turmoil and peace seems like it kind of comes and goes. Now I'm not suggesting that God is not strong enough to have that peace there all the time but as soon as we feel like we have this whole peace and connection with God figured out, disease strikes and it rattles us to the core and our peace becomes a little less peaceful. And we long for that day when the One who has fulfilled the Aaronic blessing—when the One who will bless us and protect us and make His Face shine upon us and be gracious to us will give us His Shalom.
 
There's an interesting thing the last moment of Jesus' physical life here on earth found in Luke 24:50-51.  It says this: This is the point when He ascended. (JR read the verses.)  Jesus stood before His disciples and He lifted up His Hands and He blessed them. And this is how He blessed them:  ""May the Lord bless you and protect you; may the Lord make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you; and may the Lord show you His favor and give you His peace.""
 
That would be my prayer for you today, that whether you are a father who is trying to figure out what being a father is, whether you are a child who is absent of a father, or whether life for you is really good, my prayer for you is the blessing of the Great High Priest of Jesus that you would have the peace of God and the only way we get that is through Jesus—through a relationship with Him, where He stands in the gap for us. Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – We say 'Abba, Daddy,' and Lord today on Father's Day, we cry Abba, Lord, asking for your continued blessing. Lord, I pray—there are many in here who struggle with the whole parent thing, whether it's because of their parents or whether it's just being a parent and Lord, I pray your blessing upon them. I pray for your spiritual guidance. I pray, Lord, that we as fathers in this room—the ones of us that have been so blessed, Lord, I pray that we would understand the importance of spiritual leadership and that we would be Jesus chasers—Lord, that we wouldn't be just content to lead our kids into safety but Lord, that we would lead them to chase you which might mean danger. Lord, I pray in that you would give us courage. Lord, I pray for the broken hearts that are in here because of dreams unfulfilled. Lord, I pray for severed relationships that they might have the chance to be restored. Lord, I pray that there will be leaders that will take the initiative for restoration. Lord, I pray that we would know that true healing is found in Jesus. Lord, I pray that we would surrender another part of who we are today at the foot of the cross of Jesus. Lord, I thank you for your love, for the unconditional love of a father. Lord, I pray that we would find our identity in you and not wherever it is that the world tags us. Lord, I thank you for this church, for this family of believers, for their commitment to you. Lord, I thank you for Jesus who was willing to give His life as a good, good Father would for His children. I pray, Lord, that if there is anyone in here today who needs to make a decision to accept Jesus as Lord and Savior, that today might be a great Father's Day for you as we bring the gift of ourselves. It's these things we pray in Jesus' Name. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",6/19/2016,
"We were driving in 2011 heading west to Durango, CO. Leigh Ann, Shanna, and I were driving through western TX with an additional passenger, Leah Knapp. She had stayed to attend a wedding so was going with us to meet up with the group of ACC kids that were already there. We were headed out to join the rest of our students here from ACC to a CIY Conference in Durango. We were driving and like a typical teenager, Leah had been sleeping in the van and I remember we were in West Texas on the other side of Amarillo. She had been sleeping for quite a while and I had seen her head pop up in the rearview mirror. If you've ever been out that direction, the climate is a little bit different, let's say, than what it is here. People from there would be shocked if they showed up here in the summer and saw all of our green cornfields—I mean, it's a different world. I remember seeing Leah's head pop up in the back seat and she looked out the window and could see nothing but tumbleweeds—it's just desert out there. Then she looked out the other side and kind of went back and forth looking out each side and I could see it on her face and her mind was wandering thinking 'Where are we?—have we been dropped onto the face of Mars?' She had been awakened to a scene that was alien to what she was used to and finally she just looked up and said, 'Who would live out here?' I laughed and replied, 'Obviously, no one.' We had been driving and driving and driving and we didn't see anyone. Maybe every once in a while we would see some cattle out in a field but there's just no one—there was just desert. As we talked, I just told her, 'If you ever get stranded out in an area like this, just walk towards the windmills.' She said, 'What?' I said, 'If you look out over the landscape, every once in a while you'll see a windmill and they have them there to water their cattle, so your best chance if you get stranded out here is to walk towards the windmill, and of course, watch for the rattlesnakes,' to which I got another 'What?' But the desert can be a tough and brutal place. We went on to Durango and spent a week there and then Leah continued with us plus we grabbed Zac out of that group and we kept going west. We drove over into Southern Utah and across the top of New Mexico and then drove to Northern Arizona and it was desert. It was all desert. I mean, at one point I remember driving on a state highway like SR 19—it was not interstate and we drove over 250 miles without coming to one stoplight or one stop sign. That's like driving from here to St. Louis on a local road and never seeing one. Well, there wasn't really any reason to stop because there is nobody there.  I mean, it's just wilderness—nothing there—but it's absolutely beautiful. It's gorgeous—some of the most beautiful places I've been in my life have been desert and have been in wilderness areas. Now, I'll qualify it with this. It was beautiful to me because I was in an air-conditioned van and had plenty of water. It was beautiful because I had provisions; I had what I needed. My thinking is that if my situation would have been different—if I had been sitting under a rock with nothing to drink for two days and I had been walking, I would say that it wouldn't have looked quite as attractive. So you can be in the same place, but your situation can be very different.
 
This week I was thinking about wilderness; I was thinking about desert—I was thinking about how everyone in life travels the road of wilderness. Everyone! At some point in time of your life, you walk on the wilderness road. You walk the road of the desert. You walk the road of being in the middle of nowhere, where no one really understands and where no one really gets it. If we would just take the time this morning and set a chair up here and you were to come up here and tell your story of your wilderness experiences, many of you could talk a long time. The stories we would hear would be the wilderness stories of heartbreak about when life didn't evolve like the way we thought it was going to in whatever situation and we had high hopes and then our hearts were crushed. We would tell wilderness and desert stories of loneliness and seclusion. Some of you could tell of times in your life when you sat in the wilderness of loneliness and seclusion where, whether they did or not, you felt like no one got it and you felt like no one was there. You could be in the middle of a room like this with other physical bodies around you but you were still isolated. We could tell the stories of the wilderness that were caused by our anger—a raging inferno that had been boiling down within us for a long time and that anger led to the wilderness. Maybe your anger resided deep within you because of abuse you took as a child—something which shouldn't have happened; maybe it was physical, maybe it was sexual, maybe it was emotional. And that sat and sat in your spirit and eventually became anger and you've lived angry and you've lived bitter because of your hurt when you've spent that time in the wilderness.
 
We could talk about the wilderness of despair. There would be stories in here of the wilderness of despair and confusion where we were so distraught; we were so hurt and so lost. We could tell wilderness stories of brokenness. When we came to the very end of our ropes and were so broken we would just sit in a chair and not really even function. We would hear stories of the wilderness of rough relationships—lots of rough relationships. We would hear stories about the deserts we've been in because of the broken relationships with our parents, broken relationships with brothers or sisters, broken relationships with friends. We would hear stories about rough relationships about how someone stood one time in a place such as this in front of family and friends and made promises to each other only to find that now it's become a tough journey. Some of those journeys may have ended and some may still be in the midst of those struggles. We would sit here and we'd hear stories of prodigal children—of parents who have tried to raise their kids in the faith. They've tried to raise their children with a love and a faith in God only to find that later in life their journey has gone in another direction. As a parent it has left us in a wilderness—a wilderness of fear for a child—a wilderness of hurt. There is no doubt that all of us will go through a wilderness.
 
There are some who spend time in the wilderness of denial but they don't realize it because they are in denial. That's more common than what you would think. You've seen it before; you've seen it on television programs where they call it an intervention where people who are family and friends who love someone gather around and sit them down and say, 'Look, you're in the middle of a wilderness; you're in danger,' but often times they are in denial and everyone may see it and everyone may get it except for the one that needs to realize it. There is no doubt, because of life and that life being a journey—we will all journey at some certain point in time to a wilderness. Most all of us have spent at least some time there already; some of us have spent significant time there. Because we will spend time in the wilderness, we will need a shepherd. Shepherds are masters of the wilderness. Shepherds in the Middle East, where a lot of it is desert—shepherds are specialists in knowing how to navigate and how to survive and not just for themselves to survive, but their flocks to survive.
 
We need a good shepherd; we need the Good Shepherd. I've come as I've lived life now more than half of the life I will have is gone—it seems to be ticking away now faster than it did a few years ago, but with that I think comes a little more wisdom and knowledge just because of life experiences and I'm so totally convinced that we need Jesus. We just can't do it on our own. We often times think we can but I've seen the strongest of people, because of life experiences, be brought to their knees. We think we don't need anybody but there are certain things that are out of our control and it's in those moments that we need the Good Shepherd; we need His rod and His staff to comfort us; we need Him to lead us beside quiet waters and we need Him to restore our souls.
 
I want to talk about a guy in the Bible for a few minutes who experienced the wilderness in 1 Kings 18. We have in this chapter what was my son's favorite story. It is kind of one of those strange wilderness things, though, because 1 Kings 18—whenever my son Zac was 2 or 3 years old, and I would say, 'Go get your children's Bible and let's read something,' and he would bring it in and I would ask, 'Zac, what story do you want to read?' and every single time he would say the same thing, 'Fire up the bull.' I would chuckle and he would repeat, 'Dad, I want to read the fire up the bull story.' It is in 1 Kings 18 and if you're familiar with it, it's the story of the great prophet, Elijah. He was kind of isolated there in Israel; I mean it is a story of great triumph, but when I say he was kind of isolated in the Nation of Israel, the Hebrew children were kind of running ragged—they weren't chasing God like they were supposed to be chasing God. Elijah felt isolated because there weren't very many people of faith around and so as the story evolves in Chapter 18 and I'm sure many of you are familiar with it, and if not, I encourage you to go and read it later but the enemy false prophets had risen up against Elijah and they were threatening his life. So he goes to Mt. Carmel in Northeastern Israel; he assembles the people and calls the nation together and calls the false prophets together and he issues a challenge. The challenge was this: he said, 'each of us will take a bull and you hundreds of false prophets take your bull and prepare it, lay it on the altar and you call upon your gods to bring fire to accept your sacrifice.' Well, this story kind of plays out like modern day NBA. I mean there was smack talk and everything. They get their bull and prepare it and put it on the altar and they pray and nothing happens. So Elijah says, 'Well, maybe your gods are out to lunch.' So they do some other things but nothing happens. Elijah says, 'Well, maybe your gods are on vacation.' Or 'Maybe your gods are in the bathroom and can't hear you' and this whole chapter is Elijah ridiculing gods that don't exist. The false prophets get to the point where they are cutting themselves and offering up their own blood so their gods will answer but nothing happens. So then Elijah, towards the end of the chapter, takes his bull, kills it and puts it on the altar and pours water on it three times. Then he lifts his hands and he prays and God throws lightning and fire, etc., down from Heaven and devours the entire thing. Now you talk about the fact that there are certain things in the Bible that would be cool to see? Fire up the bull would be one of them. Fire up the bull would be very cool—from a distance, of course. I mean can you imagine after watching all day and the false prophets calling, calling, calling with nothing happening and then Elijah says, 'God, reveal yourself,' and BAM? There would have been a huge collective gasp and then Elijah orders that the false prophets be taken off the mountain and down to the valley to be slaughtered because it is serious in God's eyes when people are led away from Him and when you do, you are at war with Him. How is this a valley? How is this a wilderness? How is this a desert? I mean, Elijah is on the mountain top; this is as good as it gets. I mean if you get to walk off the NBA floor with a little strut in your step, this is his time. This is when Elijah can stick his chest out a little bit and say, 'You know—I told you; this is the God we serve.' If there was ever a time you would be excited about life, this is it, but let's look now at Chapter 19.
 
It says, (JR read 1 Kings 19:1-2.) 'I am the Queen and I am going to kill you. What you just did to my prophets, I will do to you.' (JR continued reading Verses 3-5a.) What? How do you get there? How do you get from Chapter 18 on top of the mountain—on top of the world—to laying under a tree asking God to take your life? I say 'how do you get there?' but some of you are saying 'I've been there and I get that.' I've been at that moment when I thought everything was perfect and thought everything was so good and then I walked into the other room and everything changed. We tend to think of people sometimes—we disconnect a little bit and we tend to think that the guy who ends up laying under the tree pleading with God to take his life that he has been laying under that tree for a long time but that's not necessarily the case. Sometimes people who look like they are at the top of their game—well, looks may be deceiving. They may be a lot like you and me—very normal—very human.
 
Elijah--if you were to list—all the prophets of God were important—I mean they were all prophets; they had a spiritual status that was good, but if you were to ask 'Who were the top 2 or 3 prophets of the Bible?' I would have to say Elijah is going to be right there. He was so heavily in despair he wanted God to take his life. Let's read on. (JR continued reading Verses 5b through 9a.) In the midst of his despair, God showed up. In the midst of his hurt laying under a broom tree, God showed up and God brought the windmill; God brought the water and God brought the sustenance in the stuff Elijah needed to survive—in the midst of his anguish and in the midst of his despair and in the midst of his desert, literally it was a desert he was laying in, God reached out to him. And guess where God led him to? God led him 40 days on a journey right back to Mt. Sinai—God led him right back to Mt. Horeb to the place where He had originally met Moses in the burning bush. 
 
There is a picture in this. The picture in this is that it is not necessarily just about God; it's about you; it's about me. The picture in this is in the midst of our despair and in the midst of Elijah's despair, no matter how distraught he was, God brought him back to a place of a question which was a question that Moses had to wrestle with—'do you trust me?' God says to Moses out of the bush, 'I'm going to send you to get the Israelites out of Egypt,' and what did Moses do? He started firing excuses back to God. We were walking through the Torah so we were there back at the beginning of Exodus.  Moses fired excuse after excuse after excuse but ultimately God was just saying, 'Moses, do you trust me? It's not about me trusting you even if you have a stuttering problem—this is about you, and not about me, so do you trust me?' In the midst of your wilderness you will find if you allow Him, God will take you to Sinai. In the midst of your wilderness—in the midst of your desert—in the midst of your struggle, God will take you back to that question, 'Do you trust me?' We have a hard time with that because we have such a strong desire to trust ourselves but God is always wanting us to think in terms of Him. All the way back to Genesis 3 which we've mentioned before and I remind us on occasion, at the first question that God asked in the Bible. That was when Adam and Eve hid from God in the Garden of Eden and God's first question was 'Where are you?' Like He didn't know? He can speak the world into existence and they hide behind a tree and He doesn't know where they are? I don't think His question was what it appeared to be. The question had a deeper meaning. God was saying, 'Adam and Eve—you and me—this situation where you just sinned and you broke our relationship, now where are you?' 'You know, you and I—relationally we were together and relationally I am in the same place, but where are you?—because you've moved.' 'You've chosen to walk away from me.'
 
And God, in the midst of Elijah's despair, as he lays under a tree, God gives him the strength to get him to Mt. Sinai so He can ask him that same question. 'Look, where are you?' 'You and I—life is hard—will you journey with me—will you trust me?' You see, it's hard for us to get to that place because sometimes we have a distorted view of who God really is and part of that I blame on our American culture and the way we have Americanized God. We have made God this Super Being that is there to serve our needs and we pray when we need Him to serve our needs. Sometimes we are told if we give some money then He will resupply us beyond that. We have some of these false teachings that aren't the heart of who God really is. So sometimes it's hard for us to sort through this that God is not really there to serve me but that I am here to serve Him.
 
In Rick Warren's book, The Purpose Driven Life, starts out with the sentence, ""It's not about me."" That is the very first sentence in the book. It's not about me—why does he say that? Because it's not about me. You see ultimately rather than God sitting in the heavens in a position to serve me and to make my life comfortable here, the reality is that God has put me here so that I can live out my journey and live out my existence to bring Him glory. Rather than bringing me glory, it's about me bringing Him glory and what I have found is that some of the best opportunities in life to give God and bring God glory is when you are in the wilderness, because when you're in the wilderness—when you're in the desert—when you're in the midst of pain, despair, loneliness, hurt, and confusion, what else do you have to rely on? If you're sitting under a rock in the middle of the desert and you're lost and you have no vehicle and you're on foot and somebody comes along on a camel and offers you a drink of water, your response probably is not going to be 'that's not tap water, is it? Because I don't drink tap water; I only drink bottled water.'  When we are desperate—when we are desperate, we're looking for something that is solid. 
 
Elijah was in the desert and God showed up. I saw that this past week. I saw that this week—I saw God show up in the midst of the desert this week. I saw a family whose 15-year old daughter had just lost a year and a half battle to leukemia. In the midst of the greatest despair they had ever experienced, I saw God show up. I saw God show up in the form of some of you—over 40 of you—who took time off work to come in and serve this family at Kiley's memorial service—who on Monday night gave up time, spontaneously came giving up time, to organize things because some funerals aren't ordinary funerals. What I mean by an ordinary funeral is I'm talking about manageable crowds. There are some funerals that might not be manageable and when it is a 15-year old girl, that's one of those times that it is possible. I can't even tell you how many family members said to me, ""Your church is amazing; your people are amazing."" I would say—you know I haven't been around many places that do things with the excellence that Beck's Hybrids does—the things they do?—it's with excellence and done really, really well. Sonny Beck stood out at the cemetery and held my hand and he said to me, ""The people of the Arcadia Christian Church are incredible; I'm blown away."" 
 
You see, here's the thing: when we're in the wilderness, we're looking for a shepherd. When we're not in the wilderness, if we are followers of Jesus, we should be a shepherd. And you know what? There are people you go to school with—there are people you play on sports teams with—there are people that you sit beside every day at work and they're in the middle of the wilderness right now and they are looking for a shepherd and if you are a follower of Jesus, it is your responsibility to be that light. It is your responsibility; that's why God put you there. He's put us here for that moment.
 
I gotta tell you; Tuesday was one of the worst days I've ever experienced in ministry, but it was also—in a weird way, it was one of the most fun and the most fulfilling because I think Kiley would have been so honored and happy, if she was here to see, I just think she would have loved it. When she arrived at the cemetery being pulled by horses all the way from here (ACC) to the Cicero Cemetery, I think she would have just been ecstatic especially to see people pointed towards a Savior.
 
I have a couple of thoughts out of Numbers because we do have a Torah portion today found in Numbers. Our Torah portion this week is Bamidbar. We're starting the book of Numbers—we finished Leviticus last week so we're now starting the book of Numbers. The book of Numbers is about wilderness. That's why I spent the majority of our time today on wilderness, because the book of Numbers is a story of wilderness.  The book of Numbers records several of the events--several of the things that transpire—several of the things that take place in the lives of the Israelites after they leave Egypt and before they get to enter the Promised Land. These are the 40 years of wandering that we talk about—the 40 years of desert—the 40 years of despair—the 40 years of death and that's what it was for them because an entire generation had to die out before they could go into the Promised Land. Why was it that God made an entire generation die out?—it was because they were grumblers and complainers and we'll get there in Numbers 13. It was a wilderness experience. This Torah portion starts in Numbers 1 where God was telling them to number their troops.  It's important what He's telling them—He's not saying to number the people and He's not saying to number the girls and to number the boys or not to number all those who have brown eyes—He was specific for them to number the troops and number those in Numbers 1:2-3 (JR read it.)  That was what they were to number; they were to number the troops. They are headed for war so they are to number the troops. Later in that same chapter, starting in Verse 5 it gives certain people from each of the tribes and it says ""these men are to assist (He read Verses 5 and 6.) I can't even pronounce some of these but it ends in Verse 15 (which he also read.) There's an interesting thing here—an interesting Midrash in teaching that I learned this week that the rabbis and the sages focus on here. Elizur, the first name that is mentioned in Verse 5, the first one of the assistants—the first one listed; his name means ""God is the Protector."" And then in Verse 15 from Naphtali, Ahira—the last one mentioned; his name means ""eye""—not I as in me, but eye as in ""eye."" Well, that's real deep. 'God is the Protector of your eye.' What does this mean? What do we put together with this? I was reading as I was studying and I read that the rabbis in Deuteronomy 32:10 at the end of Torah say that God in these few verses here that God is giving us a picture where God says about Israel that 'He protected them like the apple of His Eye.' God is the Protector at the top; at the bottom is the eye and who is in between there?—everyone else! The entire Nation is wrapped up in those few verses with God as the Protector of these people like the apple of His Eye.
 
What does that mean for you? What that means for you if you are a follower of Jesus then you have come to Him by faith and you are engrafted and you are adopted sons and daughters into the family of believers and you're right in the middle of that and God is your Protector. Some would say, ""Yeah, I wish He was my Protector; He sure has done a great job. Have you seen what all has gone on in my life?"" God being your Protector—sometimes we don't think through the big picture of Scripture. God has never told us we're not going to have issues; God has never told us we're not going to have struggles. Jesus Himself said, 'Do not fear the one who can just destroy your body but fear the one who can destroy your soul.' In that statement Jesus acknowledges what Job learned and that is what?—that Satan will wreak havoc with our lives. Why? Because he hates God. It's not because he hates you; Satan wants to destroy you because he hates God—it has nothing to do with you. Don't think more of ourselves than what we ought. It really doesn't have anything to do with you. It really doesn't have anything to do with me. He hates God and God loves you. Mothers and fathers in here—what's the quickest way to enrage you? Hurt you or hurt your kid? Satan is very strategic; it's not about me, but when he is successful in destroying me, he snickers because he knows that hurts God's heart.
 
God has never said we won't go through struggles. Jesus said 'you will go through struggles.' Jesus said it will be hard but God is our Protector and spiritually Satan can't do anything to separate me from God; spiritually he can do nothing. He has no power over me; he can cut off all my fingers and he can poke me in the eyes—he can do worse than those because he can torture me with snakes—that would be the worst for me, but he can't do anything to separate me from my eternity—nothing. And you've heard the statement before, maybe; if he even thinks about that, all we have to do is speak that I know he's headed for hell and I'm not—he is the one who has the bigger problems—not me. I may have to endure hell on earth for a while through circumstances but my eternity is in the hands of a Savior that has prepared a place for me.
 
In Numbers 2 we find the arrangement of the tribal camps and I learned some really cool stuff that I don't have time to go into—some really cool stuff as to why they were arranged in the orders that they were—why 3 were on the north and 3 were on the south and why they were where they were and with who they were camped and the reasons why. But here's the interesting thing here that we find in Numbers 2:3. (JR read Verses 3-4.)  Nahshon—anybody remember Nahshon? This is not the first time we have heard about Nahshon. If you remember, Nahshon is the guy that the sages teach that at the time of the exodus when they came to the Red Sea, Nahshon was the one that did what?—he was the one who charged into the waters and said, 'Let's go. Let's go because God is in the middle of this.' And we see now that we get to the other side of it that God has elevated him as the Prince of the tribe of Judah. He is the one who stands before the people of Judah in Numbers 10:11-14 where it says this: (JR read the passage.) When they would pack up and they would camp, they would be at a place where God would tell them, 'It's time to move' and they would pack up and when they got ready to leave, it was Judah who led. It was Judah who would pack up their things and they would be the ones to set forth first; everyone else would fall in behind. It was Judah who would pack their stuff and they would charge into, if there was going to be enemy territory, with Nahshon, the Prince of Judah right at the front of the charge.
 
We get to Revelation 19 and we find this. We find that the sky splits and from the heavens descends the Prince of Judah, who is Jesus the Messiah who will lead the armies of Heaven. The picture we see in Numbers is a pre-picture of what is going to happen in the end as the Prince of Peace—as the King of Kings leads the Armies of Heaven to come and rescue you—that the One who was the First Fruits of the Resurrection, Jesus, will raise from the dead all those who have died in Him. What an awesome thing to think now—right now as Scripture says that Jesus is preparing a place for you. He's preparing a place for you. What you see here—this is not your future. Jesus is preparing a place for you. A week ago Saturday Kiley took her last earthly breath and she shows up at a place that Jesus prepared for her. I can't hardly wrap my mind around that. The stuff you need?—He's prepared it for you. Individually for you if you trust Him!  You see, He's made the offer, but you don't have to go. He's given you the choice.
Someone said 'Why does a loving God send anyone to hell?' God doesn't send anyone to hell. We choose—we choose by not choosing Him. And I know it is complex and it isn't as simple as that—I get it and I know somebody's going to be sitting there thinking about people in some country who have never heard about Jesus, but let's deal with the here and now with us. You have the opportunity to accept Jesus as your Messiah, to go into a watery grave to die into His death so that you can be birthed through water a second time into eternal life. It's up to you. Let's pray.
 
 
 
Closing Prayer – Abba Father, thank you for the picture we have from the book of Numbers showing the Prince of Peace, Jesus, will be the One leading the armies of the Heavens. Lord, we look forward to that day when you bring us our salvation. We look forward to that day when you usher in peace from the wilderness for all of the world. Lord, I pray that we would experience you Shalom—your peace. Lord, I pray that if there is anyone in here today who needs to accept you as Lord and Savior, who needs to surrender to themselves—Lord, who needs to not necessarily leave the wilderness because sometimes it is good that we are in the wilderness, but Lord, if they need you as their guide in the wilderness, Lord, I pray that today will be a day of salvation. Lord, give us the courage to take the steps that we need to take in order to get the healing that we need for our souls. It's these things we pray in Jesus' Name. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",6/12/2016,
"Graduation Sunday!  You endured, persevered, persisted, withstood, sustained, stuck with it, and made it through—the Book of Leviticus!  You thought I was talking to the graduates about school, didn't you?
 
I just want to review a little bit, especially if anyone in here is new at ACC, where we have been over the past 6 months.  I want to talk about what we have been doing. We have been going through, over the past several months, the books of Moses; they are also called the Pentateuch, Books of Law, the first 5 books of the Bible, and the Torah. What we have been trying to get at is where we have seen these pictures or shadows of Jesus, and what we have discovered so far is that Jesus is all over the place.  In today's portion, it is the last couple of chapters of Leviticus and it isn't really any different.  Let's turn to Leviticus 26.
 
I have always known in my head that it was always better to obey—to listen—to listen to my parents—to listen to my teachers.  It was always better for me as a kid if I did what I was supposed to do. Anyone else discover that growing up? I knew it was always better and things would work out better if I did, but it didn't always transfer from my head to my heart—or more specifically from my head to my hands and feet.  It just didn't quite play out sometimes.  One example was when I was a kid in high school.  I grew up on a farm and we had little dirt bikes and trail bikes and we had this one 3-wheeler. There were certain rules that we had about those things and just last weekend—Memorial Day weekend, we were riding some of those and my parents were going over with their grandkids what some of the rules were much like they did with my brother and me years ago.  Back when I was in high school, it was winter time and we would go back in the fields and there was this one low place in the field where water would congregate and freeze because the water couldn't drain out of it and it was an area way bigger than this room and it was a foot to 18 inches deep.  It would stay there throughout the winter and just be a nice frozen pond to drive across.  If you got going really fast and then hit the brakes on the ice, it was so much fun. STAY OFF THE ICE! But it was so much fun. Sometimes you could hear the ice cracking behind you.  The problem was stopping because then you would sink down to the bottom and get wet up to your knees; then we would have to walk a half mile back to the house and explain why we didn't listen and why there is a 3-wheeler stuck in the middle of the field.
 
We've all been there; we all have our own stories where you just wish you had obeyed.  Mine wasn't really significant but your stories could be more serious—ones in which you wish you would've listened and paid attention, but you didn't, and you paid the price for it.  In fact, you may still be paying the price for it.  It could've been relationally, financially, spiritually—it doesn't really matter, but aren't there times we just wish we would have listened?--not just listened, but obeyed.
 
That brings us to today's Torah portion in Leviticus 26 and 27. I am going to deal mostly with Chapter 26.  Now, there is a word in these two chapters but mostly in Chapter 26 which is mentioned 8 times and that word is ""if."" A lot of times we might not pay attention to such a small word, but in this case, this little word carries a lot of weight.  Most of them are in if/then kinds of statements where it says if this, then that.  I'm sure you're familiar with them; they are statements like this:  if you don't eat your vegetables, then . . . . (You can fill in the blanks after each one.); if you don't clean your room, then . . . . ; if you don't zip up your coat when it's cold, then . . . . ; if you don't lose some weight, then . . . . ; if you don't start exercising, then . . . . All those are if/then statements that if you don't do something, then there will be some type of consequence.  Now those were all in the negative, but you can also have them in the positive: if you get straight A's, then . . . . ; if you get all your chores done, then . . . . ; so there is this if/then stuff going on and that is Chapter 26; that is Leviticus 26. And it all begins in Verse 3 and it just says: ""If you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands, then . . . ,"" for the next 10 verses God describes some of the good things that will happen. Then comes Verse 14 where it switches gears. Verse 14 says ""But if you will not listen to me and carry out all these commands . . . ,"" then there is a string of bad things for the next 25 verses. So if you listen, there are good things but if you don't, there are some bad things listed in the next 25 verses—then you get to Verse 40. You get to Leviticus 26:40 where we find another ""but if"" and then there is another big turn that I'll go into just a little bit later, but I want you to see that the word if in Leviticus 26 has a very prominent role.
 
I won't get into it chronologically but I want to start in the middle—I want to start in Leviticus 26:14 where it starts out ""but if.""  It says, ""But if you will not listen to me and carry out all these commands . . . ."" We've been through Leviticus and it has a lot of commands where we find ourselves scratching our heads and asking 'What does this mean?' and 'Why is this important?'—it's important because God said so. (Clint read Leviticus 26:14-17.) If you keep going through Verse 39, there is a lot of bad stuff and it is not going to go well with them if they don't obey. It's going to go bad if they don't listen and obey. In James 1:22 (Clint read it.)  God is pleading with His people here saying, 'Do what I tell you; it will go better for you if you do, but if you don't, this is what's going to happen.' And it's just like a father; it's just like a parent. Have you ever been there with your kids before and you say, 'Okay, I need you to do this; if you don't clean your room, then this is your consequence,'—whatever you decide it will be.  You know when you say that, kids are usually right on it and say, 'Yes, Mom or Dad, I will honor and respect you and go do it.'  Right? (Laughter prevailed.) Isn't that how it works? Okay, well, not so much. So you sit and you wait and nothing happens—you're still sitting on the couch when you asked them. So you say, 'Okay, if you don't do this,' you say, 'this and this is going to happen.' That always gets them going, right? You end up getting up and having this long string of things that you go through—you know a lot of times, things don't start to happen until you get up out of your chair or off the couch, so they know Mom and Dad mean business—this is what's going on here—God says 'If you don't do this, then this is what's going to happen.' And in paragraph after paragraph, He says, ""but if."" Then in Verse 18 and Verse 21 and Verse 23 and Verse 27 and He goes on and on and it is a picture of a Father and His children trying to get them to see—trying to get them to obey—and that's what He does with us. There are 5 times in Verses 14 through 39 'if after all this you keep disobeying—in spite of all these things . . . .' Then the last one in Verses 28 and 29 it says this: (Clint read them.)  That has happened. If you go look in some of the history in 70 A.D. there was a story told by Josephus who was a Jewish historian where the Roman General Titus came into Jerusalem and cut off food supplies and Josephus actually recorded some stories of parents thinking their children were going to die anyway in doing it. If I could put a phrase or a slogan on this section of Scripture right here, in this middle of Chapter 26 where these 'but if' statements are, it would be sin has consequences. And if you read down through that and read through all the things and think of God like a parent saying 'You guys, 'if you don't do this, then this,' or 'but if' or 'in spite of this,' He is pleading with them and He's telling them their actions have consequences.
 
If you look down through it, it sounds a lot like our world today. It is not going well in our culture; we live in a world that is not getting any better, at least it doesn't seem like it to me. We live in a world, and I'm going to speak specifically with our country that we can talk about how we were founded on Judeo Christian values and all those things but we have totally turned our backs on that and walked away from them and it is not going well for our culture or any of us as a whole. I read Leviticus 26:14 and on and see our society in that—now mind you I don't see any us eating our kids but in a sense, our kids are paying the price; they are paying a price, and I said earlier when we had our graduates up here that a lot of these students—they are going through and have gone through different things than what you and I went through as adults. They just do; I used to think that it's all the same and that we went through the same stuff, but listen—it's not. It is different, and some of the things you and I experience when we are talking about when they were maybe first introduced to something, just culturally, they are introduced to it at a much younger age than what you and I ever were.  And that is our sons and daughters that are going through that. Sin has consequences and our sons and daughters pay the price as well and I can't imagine what my grandkids will experience if something doesn't change, so I pray 'Lord, come back quickly.'
 
The second part in another 'but if' statement is in Chapter 26: Verse 40. This is so cool—I want you to think of God as a parent and He's saying, 'If this, then this,'—what we've been discussing—but in Verse 40 God says this: (Clint read Verses 40-43.)  Then He goes on down in Verse 44 He says, ""I will not reject . . . ."" And in Verse 45 He confirms that He will remember that covenant. Despite all the things before—despite when we didn't listen and we committed all those sins and God has all these consequences and even though we've turned our backs on Him, God says 'If they confess their sins, I will remember—I won't reject,' and that's what a loving Father does and if I could take a phrase and a statement and stick along this side where God says 'I will remember,' it would be this: God is Faithful. Romans 5:8 says ""While we were yet sinners, Jesus Christ died for us.""  God is faithful; God is faithful.
 
I really want to get back to the first part of this chapter—to 26:3 because that's where all the good stuff is at—that's where we find the more pleasant stuff, but I want to read something else to you first. There was a preacher in Missouri—his name was Boice Mouton--that was at a summer camp with middle school kids and as he was teaching and preaching, he shared this poem with these kids. This was the poem that he told to them:
 
   Mary had a little pig and he was white as snow.
  That is, when he had had a bath, as you of course might know.
  But Mary had an awful time to keep that piggy clean,
  For he was just the dirtiest pig that one has ever seen.
  She'd wash him and scrub him until he would squirm and squeal,
  As if he wanted her to know he'd had an unfair deal.
  And then in the green backyard he'd play from morning until night,
  Unless he'd happen to sneak out and lose himself from sight.
  Mary thought and wondered much what she could ever do,
  But then she figured out a plan and this she carried through.
  She took him to a doctor, who put the pig to sleep.
  And then he took his heart right out! But not of course to keep.
  And then he took a little lamb and took his heart out, too,
  And put it in the little pig before the piggy knew.
  When little piggy did awake, he had no more desire
  To wallow in the mud or forever in the mire.
  So you see, boys and girls, we need a new heart too,
  Just like the little piggy did, the old will never do.
 
Being as it was a group of middle schoolers and in that bunch there are middle school boys, there was a kid at the back who raised his hand and he asked, 'Whatever happened to the lamb?' and Brother Boice, who was quick on his response, said, 'Oh, son, that's pretty heavy' and he continued, 'He was pierced for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on Him, and by His wounds we are healed.'
 
I said I wasn't going to talk much about Leviticus 27 and if you read it, there is this one thing and I may be taking it out of context but it stood out to me. I've read this passage of Chapter 27:9-10 over and over and over this past week and it talks about redeeming what is the Lord's and setting prices for things and side things devoted to the Lord but there are these two verses that just kind of stuck out to me but it reminded me of this and it was in Verses 9-10 and it says, (Clint read it.)  There are two things that just stood out to me and it's just two words—those two words are substitute and holy. It just reminded me of Jesus and that He was my substitute and He was already Holy and because He was my substitute and because He was already Holy, He makes us Holy. That substitute is what gets us back to the beginning, I believe, of this whole portion—back to Leviticus 26:3. So if you want to flip back to that spot, it says: (Clint read Verses 3-12.) Doesn't that sound good? He will put His dwelling place among us and He will be our God and we will be His people.
 
Turn forward into the New Testament to 2 Corinthians 6. In the midst of this the Apostle Paul as he is writing to the Church of Corinth, he is talking about idolatry. If we went back and looked at that middle section of Leviticus a lot of that bad stuff has to do with idolatry and putting other things over God and having things that don't satisfy and in the midst of Paul talking to the Corinthian church about idolatry, he says in Verse 16 (Clint read it.) And I believe that there he is talking about the Holy Spirit; he is talking about the Holy Spirit of God coming and dwelling among us. You see God wanted to be close and He dwelled in the Tabernacle and then Jesus came in the flesh and He walked among them and He could high-5 them and touch them and do all these different things with them but then Jesus left and left the people with confusion. Jesus said 'I will send you my Spirit.'
 
Now turn to John 14. Jesus is talking to His disciples in several chapters—I mean it is a huge discourse of instructions to His disciples and He starts in Chapter 14:15 where He talks about the Holy Spirit and how He is going to come and that the world can't accept Him, but He is going to come and guide them and then in Verse 22 it says this: (Clint read Verses 22 and 23.) God wants to live with us; He wants to dwell with you and if I could take just a couple words and put beside this beginning passage of Leviticus 26, they would be God restores. God restores and God wants to dwell with us. When Jesus sent His Spirit on the Day of Pentecost—if you look in Acts 2, everything changed. Up until that point, the disciples had seen Jesus—they had spent time with Him and then He ascended. Jesus said, 'Go and just wait and hang out,' so they were all hunkered down still in a room and everything and then 'boom'—when the Holy Spirit came upon them, everything changed, and that's because God was dwelling within them. The disciples were no longer really afraid, but instead they were bold and they walked with confidence and as a result, the church was birthed and the world has never been the same.  That's because God was dwelling within them.
 
What about you? What if you woke up every morning with the realization that if Jesus has been your substitute—that if Jesus has made you Holy—what if you woke up realizing that God is dwelling inside of you and you really believed it and I really believed it—wouldn't it have changed the way you live? Wouldn't it have changed the way you interacted with people? Wouldn't it change the way we acted with our kids or change the way we are with our co-workers? Maybe it would change the way that we drive? Or maybe the way that we talk when we drive when someone cuts us off? I think that if we really believe that God was dwelling within us that it would fully change our lives and everything about us and not only us, it would change those around us. What if we as a church—and can you imagine if every one of you started doing that and when we come together as a church living in that confidence and knowing that God is dwelling in us and among us, we could turn this place upside down. That's why I know when looking at the book of Leviticus and leading to the book of Acts, that's why I love the book of Acts is because I mean, God was just everywhere. He was doing everything and it's because the people said, 'Yes, we want you to dwell with us. We want you to dwell among us.'
 
What I'm trying to say is this: Because of the consequences of our sin, the only way to be restored to a dwelling relationship with God is through Jesus and my question for you guys today is 'do you have that?' If not I want to encourage you to get that kind of relationship with Jesus so that we can spend eternity with Him. Because that is the best way to live in obedience to God and in Him dwelling among us.  When we live in obedience and He dwells among us, incredible things can happen.  Sin has consequences; God is Faithful and God restores. Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – God, I thank you for your goodness and I thank you for your grace and for your faithfulness and that you long to restore us and to make us right with you. Help us to see the consequences of our sin and that we would see your faithfulness, God, and that we would realize that you want to restore us and have a dwelling relationship with you. We just pray all of that today in Jesus' Name. Amen.",Clint Flanders,"Arcadia, IN",6/5/2016,
"Happy Race Day!  I'm going to cover a lot of information in a short amount of time so we're going to scoot along. Last week we looked at Leviticus 23 and looked at the yearly calendar—the religious calendar that God gave to Israel. Today we're going to look at something entirely different in scope, but I believe it's one of the most important things that the book of Leviticus teaches.
 
There is an interesting conversation that happens in the book of Luke 24. It's a story we have talked about before; it's post-resurrection—actually it is post resurrection but the people who the story is about didn't realize it was post-resurrection. We find the story of two disciples walking on the road to Emmaus. They are walking on the road to Emmaus and they are distraught after what has just happened as they have just witnessed the death and burial of Jesus. I don't know if they were anticipating that but that's where we pick up the story. They've been through Passover Week; they have seen the death and burial of Jesus and know He is the One they have heard about—the One they have seen and followed when suddenly Jesus appears to them on the road to Emmaus and begins a discussion with them.  In the midst of that discussion as Jesus is asking them 'what is wrong?' and 'what they are distraught about?' this is what they said: (JR read Luke 24:21.) They had told Jesus about Himself and what had happened—not knowing it was Jesus that was walking with them and then they said that to Him. ""We had hoped that He was the one that was going to redeem Israel."" Jesus goes on during the rest of the conversation in the following verses and tells them 'Look this is what was spoken about by the prophets and this is the way it was supposed to go and that He was supposed to die, etc.,' and then God opens their eyes and they realize that it is Jesus that is walking with them. But the question today is why does this whole idea of redeeming Israel and why were they thinking like that? Why were they thinking in terms of this bondage—the servitude—that they had at the current time in their context to Rome? Rome had been suppressing them; Rome had all authority over them, basically over their land and they hoped that He was going to be the Redeemer. You see the context that they lived in was an Old Testament context. It was an Old Covenant context; what I mean by that is it was a Genesis to Malachi context. When they read the Scriptures, what they read was Old Testament. So what they had been taught—this frame of mind they had was this idea of a redeemer. We've talked about even in the Torah this whole idea of Messiah, the Son of David—this Messiah who would come on to the scene and would even surpass David as a leader. He would be the greatest leader that Israel would ever have and would ever see.
 
In this whole scope of context I want to point out a couple more things. In Acts 17 the Bereans are encouraged; the Bereans are applauded—do you remember what it was for? The Bereans were applauded because when the Apostles taught them, they checked the Scriptures to make sure what the Apostles were saying was true and accurate. Well, they weren't flipping to 1 Corinthians; they weren't flipping to 1 or 2 Timothy—they weren't flipping to Matthew, Mark, Luke or John or Romans or Acts or any of them. They were flipping to their context—they were flipping back to the Old Covenant. This is why it is absolutely critical, I believe, that New Testament era believers understand Old Testament, because the context of the New Testament assumes that you have a teaching of having read the first 39 books. There are certain things that the New Testament doesn't necessarily repeat, repeat, repeat, because it's already been spoken in those 39 different books.
 
In Acts 1 we have another example of this, but only it's not an Old Testament context—it is both an Old Testament context and a Jesus context.  Acts 1 is the last moments of Jesus physical life on earth and this is what it says: (JR read Acts 1:1-3.) This ties into what I read in Luke 24 about the two disciples 'hoping He was the one who was going to redeem Israel' because this has the same context that goes with our Torah portion today. So Jesus post-resurrection—He hangs on a cross; He dies and is buried in a tomb and He is raised from the tomb and for 40 days He appears to His disciples—He appears to His apostles and teaches them about the Kingdom. He speaks to them about the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Kingdom of Israel. It says that on one occasion He was eating with them and He gave them this command. (JR continued reading Verses 4-7.)  In Verse 6 they asked Him a question, ""Lord, are you at this time going to restore the kingdom of Israel?"" The disciples on the road to Emmaus said 'We had hoped that it was this Jesus that was going to redeem us'—that was going to redeem Israel and restore Israel to the glory that the Old Testament speaks about. Here, the disciples after spending 40 days learning about what the Kingdom is asked Him the question, 'Is it at this time that you are going to restore the Kingdom to Israel?' Jesus' answer is what?—'don't worry about times or dates.' Jesus' answer is not 'Oh, you've got it all wrong. I've spent 40 days teaching you and 3 years prior to that and you still have no idea what I'm talking about? I've spent 3 years teaching you and now 40 more days specifically teaching you about the Kingdom and you still think it's just a spiritual Kingdom, or you don't understand that it's just a spiritual Kingdom—you still think it's a physical Kingdom?' That wasn't His answer; His answer is consistent with Genesis to Malachi--this idea that God is going to be the Redeemer of His people Israel.
 
Now, that brings us to today's Torah portion to that background, that backset—that backdrop of this whole idea and it's Leviticus 25. Today's Torah portion is Leviticus 25, basically just the one chapter and it does include the first verse of Chapter 26. Today's teaching is that this portion is the laws of the Sabbatical years—the name of the portion is called Behar and it's taken from the first sentence and it just means 'on Mount Sinai' and I won't address that today because I want to get to this whole idea of what is the heart of Chapter 25. The heart of Chapter 25 is redemption. The heart of Chapter 25 is redeemer.  Chapter 25 are the laws of the Sabbatical years—the first 7 verses speak about how they were supposed to farm, that they were to grow their crops for 6 years but on the 7th year they were to allow their fields to have a Shabbat, a Sabbath rest.  Just like the days of the week, last week we talked about how on the Sabbath, God used that as an appointed time that man would remember and always remember that God is the Creator of the Universe because on the 7th day God rested and we are reminded that God is the Creator of the Universe. And so He does the same thing with years and with the fields and with the harvests. They are to plant for 6 years and work their fields for 6 years and then on the 7th year they are to let it lie. But what naturally happens? Yes, things are going to grow. Things are going to grow that you didn't necessarily intend to plant—they are what? They are last year's seeds that fell on the ground and they were there and eventually they sprout and they grow. And God says on that 7th year you can eat that as long as you don't do the work, you can go out there and you can harvest that and eat it—that's what you can eat and all the aliens in the land—that's what they do.
 
Then we get to Leviticus 25:8 and He talks about another period. He says this: (JR read Verses 8 through 13.) This happened on the Day of Atonement—we talked about that last week—Yom Kippur. Now this was a big thing within the life of Israel; it was a big thing that God gave to the people. The year of Jubilee was basically like a ""reset"" button; it's like when you restart your computer, you shut everything down and restart it—or reboot it. Jubilee was kind of like a reset button for Israel.  In the year of Jubilee all debts were cancelled. In the year of Jubilee land reverts back to the original owner so that it would stay with the same clan or within the same families within the life of Israel. In the year of Jubilee those who were in servitude—those who had sold themselves into slavery and ordered to pay a debt—were freed, but ideally, the Jubilee year shouldn't have really had an impact upon anybody. If life went the way that it should, God had already incorporated into the life of Israel a redeemer who should have already redeemed that which was lost and that's what I want to talk about today—this whole idea of Redeemer.
 
What is a redeemer? What does redemption mean? And what is this redeemer? There are two different Hebrew terms—two different primary Hebrew terms that talk about this idea of redeemer. Now, this is important. We started in Luke 24 with the story of two disciples on the road to Emmaus and they said they were hoping He (Jesus) was the One that would be the Redeemer of Israel. We then jumped to Acts 1 where they said, 'Is it at this time that you are going to restore (redeem) Israel?' So what we're going to learn today is the context, the mindset, of those first disciples and why they asked the questions that they asked. The first Hebrew term is padah. In our terminology, this term 'padah' simply means, using our English, ransom. It's ransom that there is a price to release something. There is a price, a monetary, or some type of price to release something. It would be a price to release a slave. In the Old Testament we find different examples of this. There would be a ransom, a padah, to release a slave. You would have a padah, a ransom that would be a substitute for one's life. If someone was in a troubling situation,--you know, that's what we see in the movies today that when there is a ransom, it's a trade-off—right? Someone kidnaps somebody and they have them and hold them for ""ransom."" It's a payment for one's life. There was a padah within the Old Covenant for the first-born son. If you had a first-born son, you would take a ransom to the Temple and you would pay a certain amount. There was a padah, I think, for a first-born donkey; you would take a sheep and give a lamb in exchange for a first-born donkey—don't ask me why about that stuff—I just read it. A padah, a ransom, would be like for a legal event if you got a speeding ticket in your chariot, or on your camel if you're going too fast and they would fine you so you would go and pay the fine. Now, the 2nd term, the pidyom, is the amount. It's the same root word but it's the amount. If it were one lamb that you needed to bring to the Temple in exchange for the birth of your first donkey, that the amount would be the pidyom. The active ransom, or the buying or the paying off—the active ransom is redemption. Okay? The active ransom is redemption. The Hebrew word is ga'al. The one who does it is the goel. The redemption is the ga'al; the redeemer is the goel. The goel, within the Old Testament, was the next of kin. He was the next of kin.
 
God incorporated within His law this idea of your next of kin becoming your redeemer and paying a padah on your behalf—paying a ransom on your behalf. The kinsman redeemer—it would start with—for me, today, it would start with my father. If my father were dead, then that would be the responsibility—and it was a responsibility—to be a kinsman redeemer. It was a responsibility—sometimes they say it was an 'option' but it wasn't really an option; it was God's heart—it was His desire and it was what He wanted. If my father was out of the picture, then it would fall to my brother to be my kinsman redeemer; then it would go to my uncle, if I didn't have a brother; if my uncles were all dead, then it would go to my cousins and right on down the line. It keeps it within the family and the redeemer, the one who pays the purchase amount keeps it within the family.
 
Let me illustrate this a little bit for you today. Let's say I have major financial issues and I am going to lose my house—they are going to foreclose on it, and when it gets into that process my uncle comes and he goes to the mortgage company and they work out a plan. They work out a plan where he just pays them, buys the house, then my uncle comes to me and says, 'I now own the house; you can live there and stay there and pay rent for it.' What a great scenario to have if you get into trouble for whatever reason. What a great family network in order to be able to help and support each other. The idea of the goel and the kinsman redeemer was never intended to be a handout. It was intended to be a way of life for people who are working together—working towards the same goals and objectives as there were times when people just fell on hard times. The kinsman redeemer was there to keep the property in the family. Now I say the year of Jubilee should never have had an impact; in the 50th year when everything reverts back to its original owners, it should never really have to be that way because if the kinsman redeemers are doing their jobs as we go along—families are helping each other—families are assisting each other, everything stays within that context anyway.
 
We have an example of this very thing way before this period of time when this law was actually given in the life of Abraham and Lot. We have a picture of this very thing in the life of Abraham and Lot. They amassed a bunch of stuff; they split and went different directions. Lot is taken captive. Let's just put it this way; I believe in those early days when he was young, he was a little bit of a pain in the rear end to his Uncle Abraham—I mean with some of the decisions that he made—now I do believe that Lot was a righteous man. The New Testament tells us he was a righteous man even though he ended up in Sodom; Scripture tells us that he was righteous, but in his early years before he had wised up a little bit, he made some decisions that I'm not so sure were the best. He gets taken captive by an opposing army. Now it would have been very easy for Abraham to sit back when he heard the news and say 'Well, He hasn't said it yet but when God gives the Torah, He's going to tell us that you reap what you sow.' Abraham could have easily sat back and said, 'He got exactly what he deserved. When you plant that in the field, that's what you end up getting and his destiny is exactly where his actions led him to be.' Abraham could have done that but that's not what he did. What did he do? He got some of his own men, some of his own people, took his own stuff and he went to war to pay the price to redeem Lot, and the price was to be willing to die himself—that was the price. We find this very thing with God. Oh, let me say one more thing about this whole idea of the kinsman redeemer. There were two other major areas where they came into play. One was the ""levirate"" duty or law. If I were to die, and I was married with no children, it was my nearest of kin—my brother's responsibility—to marry my wife and have children with her so that within my family, they would continue to live on. What book do we find that in?—the book of Ruth. The whole book of Ruth is about the law of levirate duty of keeping that within the family.
 
Then there is another one and it's kind of a fascinating one that will jump me to my next thought and it's found in Numbers 35—I know we are not to Numbers yet—we will be in about two weeks when we start that book, but in Numbers 35 we find that it is the kinsman redeemer's responsibility to be the avenger of blood. If someone killed my brother, it was my responsibility to kill them—blood for blood. We get that in the teachings of the cities of refuge. Now this is a crazy concept and sometimes we get all bent out of shape when we hear about it. We hear about it today mostly—we still hear about it today, but today it's mostly within Islamic nations—those types of vengeance things that are actually lived out, but the kinsman redeemer had a responsibility to be what the Bible termed 'the avenger of blood.'
 
The prophets picked up on this whole line and this whole thought of redemption. The prophets taught from Isaiah to Malachi over and over and over with this whole idea of purchasing—this whole idea of ransom. The prophets spoke of a future time when God would again rescue the Israelites from the nations of the earth, but they spoke about it in the context of that God has already acted as the goel for Israel. God has already acted as the goel of Israel, as the Redeemer for Israel, when He went into Egypt and brought His people out. When they were in the land of Egypt, they were like the poor man; they were slaves; they had lost everything. They had been literally, physically sold into slavery—right? Isn't that how Joseph got there to begin with? They were in slavery; they were in bondage; they had no land that was their own and God became their goel, their kinsman Redeemer as He went into Egypt and He was the avenger of blood. He poured out the plagues and He brought His people out.
 
The prophets speak of a future time when God will again rescue the Israelites from the nations of the earth—not just from Egypt—the prophets speak about the fact that God's people will be sent into all of the nations of the earth and He will then bring them back to their land. In Isaiah 63:1-4 we find these words. (JR read it.)  ""The year for me, to redeem, had come."" This picture of the Messiah exercising judgment upon the world is a day of redemption. And just as the first Moses went into Egypt to lead the people out of slavery into freedom, so the second Moses, the Bible speaks of being the last redeemer, shall also become a kinsman redeemer. The last Messiah, the second Moses, and I say that because if you read in Deuteronomy, Moses keeps saying that 'God will send a prophet like me,'—God will send a prophet like Moses in the future—that's why I refer to him as the second Moses. Moses was the redeemer; he was the one that stood before the Pharaoh; he was the one that brought the people out so Jesus will be the one who comes and stands on God's behalf. That is why in Luke 24 on the road to Emmaus, they said, 'We had hoped that He—this Jesus—this Yeshua--He was the one who was going to redeem Israel.'
 
We know there is a time coming because the prophets spoke about it. There is a time coming when God is going to march in to the world and bring His people out and set them free. That's why in Acts 1, not just because of the prophets, but based upon what Jesus had just taught them for 40 days regarding the kingdom; they said, 'Is it at this time that you will restore the Kingdom to Israel?'
 
At the very end of the Torah in the book of Deuteronomy 30:1-5 it says this: (JR read it.)  Through the death of Jesus, He paid the pidyom. The death of Jesus paid the ransom. The book of Hebrews says He gave His life as a ransom for many. We were held hostage—we were just like in the movies; we have been kidnapped by the adversary. We have been taken to a far-off remote place where no one could find us except for the true Redeemer—except for our kinsman Redeemer—the one who came and gave His life. It is the resurrection of Jesus that proves He has the power and the authority to pay the ransom.
 
Job, in his book—you know not many people in their lives have gone through what Job did. Whenever I think I'm having a bad day, I just read Job 1 and it's perspective—not that my day is not still bad, but it could be a whole lot worse. And Job said in Job 19:25-27. He says this: (JR read the passage.)  Even Job said that 'I know that my redeemer lives.' It is through the resurrection of Jesus that He proves He has the authority to ransom, that He has what it takes to buy us back. Now Paul says that 'we have been freed from sin'—that we have been ransomed from sin. But just like the Israelites when they came out of Egypt, God referred to them as 'my slaves that I have brought out of Egypt.' When He brought them out of Egypt, there is what?—there is a servitude to the one that bought you, and God refers to the Israelites as 'my slaves that I brought up out of Egypt.' Paul says, 'We have been freed from sin but have become slaves to righteousness.' It is our duty to pursue right living.  Right living is not what saves us—don't misunderstand. It is the grace of God through faith and trust in Him. We are saved by grace through faith but there is an element to which we become slaves. Why did James, the brother of Jesus, refer to himself as the bondservant of Jesus? What was a bondservant?—it was a slave! He had willingly given himself to be a follower. That's why we say that 'we are not our own but we were bought with a price,' the Scripture says.
 
Now there are two aspects to this and I don't have time to get into both, but I hope that throughout the course of weeks and months that this has become a little more obvious but there is the redemption of God on a physical level and there is the redemption of God on a spiritual level, and both are true.  The Kingdom of God is not just a spiritual kingdom, but is the kingdom of God a spiritual kingdom—yes! Is it exclusively a spiritual kingdom—no! Because from the beginning of Scriptures, God told Abraham to walk the land and Abraham walked the perimeter of the Promised Land and God said, 'I am going to give this to you and to your people to live in freedom and in peace . . .  all these things' and guess what?—it has never happened! NEVER!
 
Oh, but it will! It will, because God is true to the Word which He speaks! What does this have to do with JR as a Gentile? JR was born into the world and his birth mom died at birth—his birth dad died at birth, too—fictitiously, I was born without parents so I need to be what?—I need to be adopted! I need to be brought in—God has brought me into His family. He has brought me into the family of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to where I have the opportunity to share in all the blessings of Israel. Now there is a teaching out there that says that the 'church' has replaced Israel and we have taken all the blessings. You know it's interesting that the church never talks about taking all the ""curses"" that Israel had. We just talk about the blessings when we talk about that type of stuff, but the reality is that God has adopted me into His family to where I am a partaker—full-blooded, so to speak partaker, as an adopted son, as an adopted daughter. You see, Jesus is your Redeemer. If you go to Heaven, it's because Jesus bought you; it is because Jesus paid your pidyom. It's because He was your goel; He was your kinsman Redeemer and you accepted that.
 
Absolutely, without question, one of my favorite passages in Scripture is Revelation 5:1-10. (He read it.)  I hope you listened to that within the context of what we discussed today. God has chosen you! Jesus has chosen you! And when I think about being chosen I think about that the responsibility is up to me on whether or not I will accept the fact that I'm chosen because I also read Scripture and I see that He also chose Judas Iscariot. Just because we are chosen doesn't mean we will accept. The acceptance is from you. Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Abba, Father, thank you again for the depth of your word and thank you, Lord that we can go to an obscure chapter in Leviticus 25 and turn over stones and wind up at the cross. Lord, I thank you for the whole idea of the Jubilee—the Jubilee year being the 50th that is a reminder that you were sending a Redeemer into the world to restore everything to the way it was intended to be. God, I pray that if there is anyone in here today who has never accepted you, even though you've chosen them—maybe there are some that have never accepted you and released life to you, God I pray that today might be that day and will be that day of salvation. God, thank you for new life—new birth—new chances. Thank you for the grace that pours out from the cross. Lord, God, thank you for Jesus; it's in His Name we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",5/29/2016,
"We, today, are in Leviticus 21-24; it is the Torah portion, Emor. We are not really going to spend any time in Chapters 21 or 22; last week I didn't get out of the first verse of the first chapter that we did last week. Today we are going to skip through two chapters and get to the third chapter. Emor simply means to say, or to speak and God tells Moses to speak these words: the first two chapters contain some more regulations or rules and directions for the priests, the Levites, on how to go about the Temple worship. We're going to get to Chapter 23 and when we get there, it is one of the most important chapters—when I say most important, it is one of what the Jews call ""weightier""—they are all important but it is just meatier and in some ways if you were to think of a tree, there is a lot of low-hanging fruit in Chapter 23 that is easy to pick. We have been on this study for 6 months or so looking for Jesus in the Torah. Today is one of those days where it is easy to pick that fruit and it's easy to find it in Chapter 23. Chapter 23 begins with this: (JR read the first two verses.)  These are the appointed times, the appointed festivals. This is a ""weighty"" chapter because of the information He gives.  He says ""these are the appointed times . . . ."" God, in the very beginning of the Scriptures, in the book of Leviticus, early on, says that there are certain times that He has appointed to have sacred assemblies and to meet with His people. These are times when God reveals Himself in a way that is different than the rest of the calendar. God gives us a holiday schedule. When we think as Americans of our holiday schedule, we think of New Year's and we think of the 4th of July and we think of Thanksgiving and all different kinds of things but there is a Biblical calendar; there is a Bible calendar—a holiday schedule. There are appointed times where God wants to meet with His people. It's on the lunar cycle; it's not on our solar calendar that we use; it is on the lunar calendar. The appointed times to meet with His people are something that the Apostle Paul addresses. I want to go there for just a minute because if you're an NIV person, there is an unfortunate translation. In the book of Colossians, in Chapter 2, and in Verses 16 and 17 Paul says this: (JR read it.) ""These are a shadow of the things,"" and in the NIV it says, ""that were to come.""  But I would challenge you to go and read and study because the vast majority of translations from King James to the New American Standard,--actually the NAS does something interesting. They add a word, and they admit that they add a word; they don't say ""that were to come,""—they downplay it by adding the word ""mere."" You would have to go and look at this to get the idea of what I am saying. My point here is this; there is a bias in Scripture translation. You hear people say and you'll hear arguments if you read a lot of controversial stuff and if you read where people debate whether the Bible is true or not, you'll hear these things quite frequently, but there is no way, I do not believe, to translate without a bias. A bias is not necessarily bad. Prejudice is bad—a bias is not necessarily bad. Now when writers translate—some of this stuff and some of the phrases are not exact words—if it were, they would write it word for word, but it doesn't work that way. So there are a lot of times where they have to insert what they think the writers are saying. That's why it is important, when you study, to go and look at 3 or 4 different translations. If you have a controversial passage of Scripture, look at 3 or 4 different translations where groups of translators—you can lay them side by side and see what different groups think. With this in the NIV, the NIV is very alone where it says, ""These are a shadow of the things that were to come."" The other translations say ""These are a shadow of things that are to come."" That is way different; things that were to come or things that are to come. The reality is it is semi-both, in a sense. If you go and finish Verse 17, it says ""the reality . . . is found in Jesus.""
 
So my point here today is Chapter 23 is the festivals; it is the feasts—it is the appointed times of God. The Apostle Paul here in Colossians is addressing this whole idea of the appointed times. Now, Paul in other places, says that the appointed times—that the celebration of the feasts, should never be legalistic; they should never be regulated in the sense of 'if you keep the feasts, you get to go to Heaven,' because that's not what the purpose was. The purpose of the feasts is to show the redemptive plan of God. The shadows are still reality; the shadows are reality. How many times have we been in a situation where we are playing hide and go seek, or that type of thing, and all of a sudden we realize our shadow is going to what?—give us away if we're not careful. I remember deer hunting in southern IN once and sitting up in my tree stand; there are deer below me as it was late in the evening and the sun was at my back and deer in front of me. I remember sitting there thinking 'I cannot move at all' because they are eating and looking at the ground and my shadow was underneath them. Now, here's the thing. Is the shadow really me?—no! Is the shadow really me?—yes! Is it really me?—no! Is it really me?—yes! The shadow, for those deer, when I move, they are not seeing me, but they are seeing me and they run. This is the reality of the feasts; it's the reality of the festivals. God says it--'The feasts are a shadow of Jesus.'  It's the redemptive plan of God—through Jesus. The shadows are shadows—the body is the Messiah. The body is the one casting the shadows, so they are very real. Are they the body?—no! Are they the body?—yes! They are the shadow.
 
So I want to jump into this a little bit and I want to go down through the different things that God institutes as appointed times to meet with His people. He starts in Leviticus 23 with Shabbat, or the Sabbath. Starting in Verse 3 He begins with Sabbath (JR read it.) Now this was written to the Jewish people and that's important to differentiate. This is the plan that God gave to the Jewish people as they embarked upon this journey—a journey to be set apart. Now, that doesn't mean it is wrong for us to participate if we desire to participate, and there is nothing wrong with participating in the shadow because the shadow is what?—it's the body—it's the reality.
 
There are 3 things in particular that I want to point out with Sabbath today that God says is important. It commemorates creation! The Sabbath commemorates creation. God gave us appointed times because it commemorates creation. In Exodus 20:11 at the giving of the Ten Commandments, He said this: (JR read it.)  When we think in terms of the Sabbath—when God gave the Sabbath—He gave it as a commemoration to the fact that He is the Creator of the universe. Do you think that the world needs to hear the message today that God actually created? Do you think the world today needs to believe and trust that God is the Creator? I mean, that is one of the biggest disasters of humanity right now is that we push God away and say 'we have evolved from a fish or something.' God says He set aside the Shabbat, the Sabbath, so that we would remember Him as Creator. But that's not it; He also set aside Sabbath so that we would remember that He is the Redeemer.  In Deuteronomy 5:15—it's interesting that this is the 2nd giving of the Ten Commandments—the one I just read was at the 1st giving of the Ten Commandments, and this is the 2nd one. He says this: (JR read the verse.) Why remember the Sabbath? Because it is a reminder that He is the Creator and it is a reminder that He is the Redeemer—that He pulls you out of slavery—that He gives you freedom and not only is it given for us to commemorate, but it's also given as a foreshadowing. The writer of Hebrews says in Chapter 4:9, that (He read it.) And the writer of Hebrews pushes this Sabbath rest out in front of us that it is still a futuristic thing that 'there remains a Shabbat for God's people'—a rest for God's people—remember, Jesus said, ""Come to me, all you who are weary and I will give you rest."" How many of us have given our lives to Jesus? How many of us have been followers of Jesus and how many of us still cry out because we need rest and we need peace?—because we live in a world where we are bombarded. The adversary is throwing darts; some of us wish he was just throwing darts, because it feels more like hand grenades. You see there is a rest to come; there is a rest that's future.
 
The 2nd feast or appointed time in Leviticus that He points to is the Passover. He points to the Passover and Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread are grouped together in Verses 4-8. He groups those together and we won't spend a lot of time on those because we just celebrated the Passover; 250 plus of us went over to the Primary School and we celebrated the Passover. When the Jews talk about Passover, most of the time they are referring to Passover week—not just the day or the event so when you hear a Jewish person talking about Passover, they are talking about the week, which is really an 8-day period—the day of Passover and then the 7 days following which is the Feast of Unleavened Bread; it's really an 8-day period. When we talk about Passover, and when we talk about this being a shadow of Jesus, it is a memory of the deliverance from Egypt. Passover is remembering the deliverance from Egypt; on the day that Jesus hung on the cross, the realization came about that the Hebrew people had been celebrating the death of Jesus for 1400 years and had no idea because now the shadow is becoming a reality; it's becoming a reality. The Feast of Unleavened Bread celebrates the sinless body of the Messiah. I've told this story several times before and I hope all of you haven't heard it but I remember the first time that I set it apart for myself to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread; I just wanted to do it; I just wanted to see what God would teach me through it and the whole idea of leaven being corruption—it was destruction—it was sin, and so this whole idea of eliminating yeast out of my life for several days—I had no idea how hard it was going to be until I was in the middle of it. I'm walking around different stores trying to figure out what I can eat. I thought I was going to die of starvation; that was what was going through my mind because everything seemed to have leaven in it. I remember it was getting later in the week and I could see the end in sight and I was kind of over the hill and I had done really well. It had been a great thing because every day when I woke up, I would think 'What can I eat today?' and 'What can I do today that does not involve sin?'  I mean that's what God was teaching me—how hard it is to stay away from sin because sin is there all the time. I remember late at the end of the week I was trying to figure out what I could eat for lunch and I was going to Noblesville and you know, pretty much every fast food place has bread and all of a sudden it dawned on me. I thought, 'KFC—I can go get some chicken.' I started thinking that the original recipe that surely it doesn't have yeast in it, so the whole drive down there I was thinking that the original recipe doesn't have breading; it seemed more like it was spices. So I'm going through this wresting match in my mind on how I'm going to avoid sin and that this idea is okay and it's fine, so I go there and order my meal. I'm sitting down there at KFC in Noblesville and I'm looking at my chicken thinking about how good this is going to taste and realized that I had eaten about half of my biscuit. (laughter) I'm not kidding; I was so focused on the chicken that I had eaten half of the biscuit. But you know what God taught me? He taught me that sin—it creeps up on you and it slips right in. The thing is that these are shadows; they are the truth—they are the reality of life, and the fact that we have a Savior who was able to go to KFC and not eat the biscuit—man! He was able in every facet of life to avoid sin and it made Him what?—it made Him the perfect sacrifice!
 
Now within the week of Passover we have another one of these feasts. It is called the Feast of First Fruits. I don't have time to break all this down but within that we find that the Feast of First Fruits happens during this time—why? Because Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15 that Jesus died to become the first fruits of the believers. We find that Jesus arose on the First Fruits because He is the First Fruit. You see these aren't what the New American Standard says are ""merely"" shadows and I told you at the beginning because it's really important they admit that they added that word ""mere""—they aren't mere shadows—the shadow is the body—it's the reality. That's not the flesh—Jesus was the flesh but these are the things that He cast the shadow out upon.
 
Well these make up the spring feasts on the Jewish calendar. There are 4 and if you include Shabbat, which is yearly, there are really 4 spring feasts:  Passover, Unleavened Bread, First Fruits, and oh, I didn't get there yet—the Feast of Weeks—the Pentecost. Pentecost was when they counted from First Fruits and they counted 7 weeks, which was 49 days, and the next day was Pentecost. What we find with Pentecost is this is the one that ends the Spring Feasts—what we find at Pentecost is that God gave His Spirit to the disciples at the Temple Mount in Jerusalem on the exact same day that God descended from the Heavens onto Mt. Sinai to give His people the Commandments. God has a purpose for what He does. He celebrates these appointed times and they were there for a reason; God says 'I am going to meet with you; look at these things—I am going to meet with you and you come to me; I am going to descend and I will meet with you.' Pentecost concludes the Spring Feasts. It's a fascinating thing with the Spring Feasts: they are all in direct correlation to the 1st Coming of Jesus. Every one of those that we just talked about, He fulfilled—He acted out—He lived out in His 1st Coming.
 
Then we get to the Fall Feasts. The first Fall Feast is Rosh Hashanah; Rosh Hashanah is sometimes referred to as the Feast of Trumpets because that's what it is. Rosh Hashanah literally means the ""head of the year."" It's the beginning of the Jewish year; it's their New Year like we have January 1; for them, Rosh Hashanah is the head of the year. It's the Feast of Trumpets; they blow the trumpets—this is a futuristic thing; I think it's now but I also think it's very futuristic. The whole idea of the trumpet within Judaism—within the life of God's people is a coronation of the king. The trumpet symbolizes repentance; the trumpet symbolizes warning; the trumpet symbolizes judgment; the trumpet symbolizes ingathering—they would blow the trumpet to what?—to assemble the congregation. The blowing of the trumpet symbolizes resurrection; the blowing of the trumpet points to the coming of a kingdom. The blowing of the trumpet, and we find it all throughout the Old and New Testaments that there is the anticipation of a Messiah and the blowing of the trumpet heralds the One who will come and fulfill Genesis through Revelation. He will come and all of the things in which have been written about Him will be fulfilled by Him.
 
We talked a couple of weeks ago about Rosh Hashanah because it began a period of 10 days—a 10-day period called the Ten Days of Awe. It's a time where the Jewish people contemplate life—they contemplate where they are with God. It's a time of repentance; it's a time to come clean. You know sometimes we say 'you know we're supposed to do that every day' but you know what?—we do, but there is nothing wrong with having appointed times to say 'God, we're putting this time on the calendar where I am going to refocus and get real serious about where I am with you,' and people say 'Oh, but we're supposed to do that every day,' but I ask you this: why do you come to church on Sundays? Do you worship the same on the other days of the week? Why do you use the appointed time of Sundays? You see what I would say is for those who look down their noses at these appointed times and say, 'Well, we're supposed to be repenting all the time,'—well, I would agree with that but we don't live that out a lot of times the rest of our lives. We would agree that we're supposed to worship every day but we have an appointed time when we come to worship.  And I tell you that's not wrong! That's fine! But during these 10 days there is a lot of traditional stuff that occurs which is kind of interesting, but it leads up to the next feast which is the Feast of Yom Kippur which we have spent the last 2 or 3 weeks talking about.
 
Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement—the Day of God's Reckoning. And I will tell you that there is coming a day when the Messiah of Israel—the Messiah of the world—the Messiah of those who trust Him—Jesus, the Christ, will explode from the skies at the last trumpet. He will come back and there will be a day of atonement; there will be a day of reckoning and it will be a lot worse than what you see in the movie ""Tombstone,"" with Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday and the day of reckoning in that movie. It will be for all mankind. We were talking about this in my WELL Group last Sunday night and we got to the point where I was talking about the judgment of God and I just broke down—I couldn't hardly get the words out because it's going to be awful, friends--for those who are outside of the grace and peace of Jesus, it will be awful. And I say the 'grace and peace of Jesus' because that's how Paul, the writer of his letters, wrote it. When he would write to different churches, he would say ""grace and peace to you.""  Why? Because the grace of God always precedes peace in our lives. ALWAYS! You can't have true peace without God's grace.
 
So you have the Day of Atonement and then five days after the Day of Atonement—here in Leviticus 23 it tells us that there is the Feast of Tabernacles. The Feast of Tabernacles is maybe the most fun of all the feasts. It is the celebration of celebrations. Just as Shabbat is given to point toward a future rest for God's people, the Feast of Tabernacles is a reminder that God is going to come and in Zechariah 14 it says that when Jesus returns to the earth, that the kings of the earth will flood Jerusalem—year after year they will go to Jerusalem to Jesus, the King, to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles. Zechariah goes on to say those kings who choose to decide not to go celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles before Jesus the Messiah—they will suffer drought, so if you live in a country where your king refuses, you either better have stored water or you had better move. Sukkot, or the Feast of Tabernacles, is also tied in with the exodus from Egypt.
 
Then there is the last appointed time—one that most people will skip over found at the very end of Leviticus 23 in Verse 39. (JR read it.) So there is the 8th day; the Jewish rabbis and sages teach that this 8th day here at the end of the Feast of Tabernacles is critical, because the 8th day is out of the norm. When you are talking about a week, there is no 8th day in a week. I addressed this a few weeks or months ago a little bit. There is no 8th day in a week. When you get to the 8th day, it's what?—it's the beginning of something new. The sages and rabbis teach here, and I would agree with them, that this whole idea of this 8th day at the end of the Sabbath rest for God's people, this Kingdom of Jesus that is coming, there will be something that will begin that is totally new and do you know what that will be? That will be Heaven as you envision it—an eternal place—the place where most all of us long for, and I say ""most all of us"" because frankly, I've met some people who don't long for Heaven. I think there will be a time when they do.
 
Friends, there are appointed times that God has given us for Him to meet with us, but I believe this. I believe that there are also individual appointed times where your life intersects with Him and it's a personal appointed time, where God says, 'Listen, today is a day of new beginnings for you, if you will just accept it—if you will just surrender.'
 
I got this week, and it was really cool, and I really appreciate it but I received some emails this past week from people. I never realized that coming back up here last week and sharing the passage of Scripture that God kind of pressed on me—if you were here, you know what I'm talking about. I got multiple emails about that this week from people who had burdens in life, who had struggles and unforgiving spirits, just thanking me because after last Sunday morning, they found release--through God's Word—through God's Grace. That can be yours. New beginnings come in all kinds of shapes and forms. What is it that God wants you to start fresh with today at this appointed time? Let's pray.
 
Closing Prayer – Abba, Father, thank you that you teach us from your word. Lord, it was you who set the appointed times; it wasn't me; it wasn't the Jewish people; it wasn't anyone else but you who ordained the appointed times. God, I pray that we would see Jesus in those. I pray, Lord, that we would understand that just as Jesus fulfilled the spring feasts in His 1st coming, He will fulfill the fall feasts at His 2nd coming. Lord, I pray that you would open our eyes that we will see and I pray that we will diligently search and that your spirit would lead us. Lord, God, thank you for the forgiveness we have through the redemptive work of Jesus that He died on a cross as our replacement. Lord, I pray that we would understand your passion for us—your love for us. In Jesus' Name, we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",5/22/2016,
"It was in 1782 a French essayist wrote a book called ""Letters from an American Farmer."" In it he described a man whose grandpa was English, his wife was Dutch and his son married a French lady. He talks in there about a new race of people that were coming to America—a new race of people that were going to be born out of coming to America; people would be coming from different backgrounds, different languages, different cultures and how those differences would fade and how they would become unified and how they would conquer some great problems in the future. Not only did he talk about different cultures in that book, he talked about religious things too, and he dreamed about a time when Catholics and German Lutherans and Dutch Reform and all of the different groups of people religiously that were coming from overseas would not be rivals but they could, in fact, be neighbors and could love each other. A little over 100 years later in Washington, DC in 1908 there was an opening for a play written by Israel Zangwill, a Jewish playwright; the play was termed ""The Melting Pot."" It was from this play that America grabbed hold of that terminology of being a nation that was a 'melting pot.' In this play David Quizano was a Jewish musician, a Jewish composer—he had come to the United States from Russia. He had left Russia to escape a pogrom that was going on, a direct assault by certain Russians to kill and to extinguish Jewish people. He came to America forever scarred—forever wounded because he had watched his entire family get slaughtered. This is the play he comes and does his music thing and eventually meets a girl named Vera and as all this is transpiring, he's buying into the American dream. He is buying into this same thought as the French essayist had written 120 or so years earlier. This whole idea of how people were going to come together and basically reform humanity—he said the following in this play—he said, ""America is God's crucible—the great melting pot where all the races of Europe are melting and reforming."" Again, it was out of that line of the play where America grabbed this idea—this term of being a 'melting pot.' Well, as the play progresses, David meets Vera and she is also a Russian immigrant and he is as excited as one could be to meet someone who speaks Russian, who he has a lot in common with even though they are in a foreign land, so to speak, that they're trying to make their own way. He's excited that she is Russian except that there is one problem and that is she is also a Christian. His Jewish friends that he has made here in the states are appalled that he would ever consider marrying a non-Jew, especially a Christian. Vera's family is horrified at the thought that she is going to marry a Jew, so they have struggles. They have struggles of other people's perceptions, they have struggles of their own, and they have struggles of this whole idea of a melting pot trying to figure out who they are in this new world. To complicate matters in this play, David and Vera discover that one of the reasons her family came from Russia was that her father was the Russian officer who was supervising the pogrom that actually slaughtered David's family, and so the question is can they cross over the rivers of blood? Can they cross over the differences to become the same?

The idea of a melting pot controversial. This whole idea of a melting pot is controversial and it's controversial because you can frame it in different ways and depending on how you frame it, it can mean something totally different. The question kind of comes out like this possibly—is the melting pot a place where people are different? Is it a place where they can come and express their differences and co-exist and embrace each other's differences and still love each other and care about each other or is this whole idea of a melting pot where everybody comes together and becomes exactly the same? Do you melt together and express your differences or do you all come together and all become exactly the same--thinking in the same way, speaking in the same way and having all the same values? I don't know; I don't even know which one is the correct definition of a melting pot or the most popular definition of a melting pot and to me, I'm not even really concerned about that.

As I was thinking about it this week I was thinking about how this melting pot idea has impacted the church and how this whole idea has impacted the church on a lot of different levels, and one of the ways that is happening today is that the church is being pushed to melt into society. Christians are being pushed to melt into society and to accept everything and really to embrace everything. One of my biggest concerns is that Christians don't know the Scriptures well enough to even know some of the things they are being pushed to embrace and know where God stands on it and I have a heart for that and those of you who have been here very long know that I have a huge heart for God's word becoming the primary source of our teaching. Even in the Christian world there are dangers with this. There are dangers with this within Christendom because there are preachers and teachers all over the place who will preach melting pot theology where they will preach and teach whatever is popular to the masses regardless of what God says about it and that's a scary place—it's a very scary place to be. It's a scary place as we try to define who it is that we are as a church—as we try to define who it is that I am as an individual. Do I draw my conclusions as to who I am to be as an individual from my own opinion and what I feel like and what seems right today or is there a different standard by which I draw from to which I go to? Those of you who know me know I'm not too much into being a conformist; those of you who are old-school Arcadia Christian Church people know from way back that I'm really not concerned that much about what people think—I'm way more concerned about what God thinks about JR. I'm way more concerned about that.

So today as we talk about this whole melting pot thing and how this impacts us as people, we are going to our Torah portion for this week. If you are new and just starting here, we have been going through, since October of last year—going through the Torah which are the 5 books of Moses = Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy and we're getting toward the end of Leviticus right now. We've been talking through these books and we have weekly readings. If you don't have a reading sheet and want one, you can stop by Guest Central and you can pick one up. This week's portion is Kedoshim; it's Leviticus 19:1 through 20:27. We will not get further than Leviticus 19:2, which is not a huge shock—although I'm going to mention this again here now. Just like typical—my messages are not always what I intended to talk about so I'm going to throw this little teaching out there. We will pass 19:2 and I'm going to throw a little snippet out there because it shows God's goodness; it shows the depth of God's Word and our portion this week later on; I think it is in Chapter 20 actually—we'll read this thing where God is talking in the law, what we refer to as the law of Moses and if you read it, He is talking about reaping fields. He is talking about when you go and you get your harvest and if you read it, it's kind of a peculiar thing that He talks about in there because He tells them not to pick the corners of the fields; He tells them not to pick the corners of the fields but it doesn't say why really at this point and it doesn't really define what the corners are; the rabbis are real specific in that God does NOT define what the corners are intentionally because He wants to search your heart.

When you read through there and you read further through the Scriptures, we find another thing with the harvesting that they were not to pick up anything they had dropped along the way as they harvested. If they dropped it on the ground, they were to leave it. The question is the why we find in the book of Ruth when we find Ruth walking around in Boaz' fields picking up grain off of the grounds so that she could eat. This whole idea of leaving the corners of the field was a provision that God wrote into the law for the poor. You were to leave a portion of your harvest for others. God didn't define how big the corner was; you were to leave the corners of the field. I guess if you had a cornfield, you could technically say that a stalk of corn was on the corner and you could leave 4 stalks of corn and technically be right leaving the corners of your field, but again, the rabbis taught that God didn't define that because He wanted to see where man's heart was and where you as a field owner where your heart was. Was your heart about getting everything you could get for you and just checking off your duty that you left a stalk in the corner and the lucky guy that gets there to get the 2 ears of corn off of it—you did your duty? Or was your mindset of thinking how much does my family and I need so how much can we leave so that others will be able to have something? Interesting, too, when I originally wrote through this studying and I wrote down that in order for the poor to eat, they had to work and they had to go collect the food which is a little different concept from our world today sometimes.

As we walk through this today I want you to see just the 2 verses that I'm going to look at has to do with that issue. It's a heart issue. It's a heart issue as to whether or not I'm just looking out for myself and my family or whether I'm looking out for others. Kedoshim—it says this in Leviticus 19:1-2. (JR read it.) 'Be Holy because I am Holy.' Kedosh is the Hebrew word for holy. This portion of the law is just entitled ""holy"" or you could just say 'be holy.' Kedoshim—holy. What is holy? You can't hardly find a more religious word—you don't find too many more churchy words than that. I mean when we think of holy, unless you're a teenager and think of 'jeans,' when you think of holy you almost always think of some kind of religious type thought process. So as we get into this today, I just want to focus on 'holy' and what that is because it's the title of this Torah portion. Holy simply means this: it means 'set apart for the divine'—the divine being God. To be holy means to be set apart for the divine—to be set apart for God. Holy also means, to take that a step further, it's 'separation from the ordinary.' Separation from the ordinary.

Last week when we talked about Yom Kippur--last week's portion is actually normally read with this week's portion. This week's portion, if you read it, is really short and it's normally combined with last week's portion to make one portion except on Leap Year within the Jewish calendar they split this in two so this week we have a shorter portion. Last week we talked about Yom Kippur—we talked about the Day of Atonement—we talked about the Holiest Day of the Year. I told you at one point last week that on Yom Kippur the Holiest Man in the world would go into the Holiest place in the world on the Holiest Day of the world. It stays with that theme of 'set apart.' God set things apart; within the Jewish law concept He set apart the High Priest of Israel as the Holy One of the Nation; he was the Nation's representative. He would walk through the Most Holy Place and go into the Holy of Holies—into the Most Holy place; he would walk through the Holy Place to go into the Most Holy Place, and he would go in there on what?—the day of Yom Kippur—the Day of Atonement—the day that God set aside, the day that God established for him to go there.

I want to take a quick surf through the Scriptures to show you some of the ideas that God has about 'holiness.' Right at the beginning of the Bible we find in the early portion of Genesis, we find that God set aside the 7th day of the week as a Shabbat—as a Sabbath—as a holy day, a day that is set aside—a day that is separation from the ordinary. We get to the early portions of Chapter 3 of the book of Exodus and we find Moses approaching God in that story we call the story of the 'Burning Bush,' and when Moses approaches God, God says to him, 'Take off your sandals for the place you are standing is holy ground.' There are places in the Bible where God sets days aside as holy, set apart; there are places in the Bible where He sets certain places—certain plots of land aside. In the Scriptures we find that the Nation of Israel is set part as a Holy Nation, a Holy Family, a set apart family; I think sometimes when we think of 'holy' I don't think we have a proper view of what that is. I think today hopefully we will clarify this whole idea that holiness is being used for unordinary, that you're set apart—that you're appointed for God. I already mentioned that we had the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place within the Tabernacle and within the Temple. The High Priest of Israel—it was said within the law that they were to engrave a gold plate to hang on him and that plate was to read 'Holy to the Lord'—set apart for the Lord that he's not to be common—he's not to be ordinary.

The Tabernacle articles—the Temple articles—all the things they used for worship in there—the altars; the table of showbread—all of the stuff; all of the implements that were used for worship were to be holy articles. In Exodus 31:13, God says this: ""I am the Lord who makes you holy."" He's speaking to the Jewish nation and He says, ""I am the Lord that makes you holy."" 'I have called you apart; I have set you apart.' God through the Scriptures shows that He is Holy. The Bible continually distinguishes between holy and the common. In Leviticus 19:2—that's the verse that I just read that's in this week's Torah portion = ""Be holy because I, the Lord, am Holy."" The Lord is Holy; the Lord is set apart. There is no other God like the Lord in the world that man might worship. God is set apart amongst all the small gods of the world. Psalm 78:54 we read of this place and some of you have been there. Some of you have said to a friend, 'I would love to go to Israel and tour the Holy Land.' You're going on a Holy Land tour when you get the brochures and you're thinking about going and they say 'Come tour the Holy Land with Marv Rosenthal or First Fruits of Zion' or whoever is leading it. Come and tour the Holy Land and the Scripture talks about that in Psalm 78 that God distinguished that place as a land set apart. In Psalm 111:9 it says that the Name of God is Holy—the Name of God is Holy. The Name of God is set apart; do you know that in the Ten Commandments He addressed that very thing, didn't He? In the Ten Commandments, God says 'You should not misuse my Name'—that you should not just use my Name for ordinary common language. So let me tell you this; when you're texting, or when you're Facebooking or when you're tweeting or you're just talking and in tweet world today we just put letters and we say, 'Oh, I went to town today and OMG, I saw this thing.' God's Name, friends, is not common. The Name of Jesus—to use it frivolously—is to misuse; it's to mix the Holy with the common. God is offended at that because what we're doing when we say 'Oh my God,' and frivolously throw Him around, what we're doing is we're taking Him away from 'sacred' and making Him normal just like everything else. We began this with 'In the beginning God created,'—either He did or He didn't. If He didn't, He doesn't exist and we don't need to worry about it and we are all just fools, but if He did, He deserves honor and respect when He declares His Name to be Holy.

In Psalm 2:6 He speaks of Mt. Zion and refers to it as my Holy Hill. In Psalm 16:10 He's speaking about Jesus and He says ""My Holy One will not see decay."" The Holy One, Jesus, who was set apart from even before birth—the One that was set apart to come into this world, it says His body will not see decay—why?—because He has been set apart and He is not common. He's not like the rest of us. In Psalm 77:13 it tells us that God's ways are Holy and we could run with that a long ways because Scripture over and over says that God says ""My ways are not your ways and your ways are not my ways,"" and the wisdom of man is the foolishness of God. The reason why the world is so messed up today is because our ways are NOT His ways; His ways are Holy and our ways are common and common ends up in trouble a lot of the time.

In the book of Isaiah it says 'The Holy One of Israel (speaking of Jesus) is your Savior and your Redeemer.' We go to the New Testament in Romans 1:2 where the Apostle Paul says that 'the word of God, the Scriptures of God, are Holy.' You see this is where if you're going to be a believer in today's world, it gets tough because if these are the Holy Scriptures—if these are the set apart Scriptures—if these are the ones that are not common and are not ordinary and if these are the ones that are special and of God, the world is telling us to forget that. The world is selling us a different Gospel. It's not really a gospel because that means 'good news' and what the world is selling is not good news because it's not built on truth. The world is going rapidly to a place telling me what I can and what I cannot preach—what I can and what I cannot say. You know what I say?—'too bad.' I don't really care because I don't answer to the world; oh, I may answer to our courts for a little while; they can take all my money and they can have my half drank water bottle; they can take what I got. They can take it from me and there's nothing I can do about it but I would rather lose for a couple decades all of my stuff than to stand before God and say 'my half full of water bottle was more important than standing for truth.'

Either the Scriptures are the Holy Scriptures or they're not. In Romans 11:16 it says, ""If the root is Holy, then the branches are Holy.' Now what does that mean? What that means is this: there is a lot of people in Christendom that do not believe that the Israelites are still the Holy Ones of God. You know what? Paul says here that the root (Israel) is Holy and that God distinguished Israel (the Jewish people) as Holy and if they are Holy and set apart, then the branches are Holy and set apart—guess who the branches are? That would be you and me if we are Jesus followers. Paul tells us in Ephesians 2 that if we are followers of Jesus that we are adopted sons and daughters of the promise; that we have been adopted and engrafted into the family of Israel. And then finally in Romans 12 the Apostle Paul says this: ""Therefore I urge you brothers, in view of God's mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices Holy and pleasing to God."" Holy—set apart—not of common use—different.

Friends, the church needs holiness. The church, by definition, is holiness. The church, by definition, are the called-out ones—called out what?—called out from the normal—called out from the common—called out to be different. Friends, our struggle is not to be accepted by culture. We shed tears over the fact that we have been rejected. We have, not just teenagers, but people that bow to peer pressure all the time to be accepted. We, as adults all the time, like to point to the problems that teenagers have of peer pressure, which is true, but I think sometimes it is a diversion so that they don't look at the problems that we have with peer pressure as adults to stand and be Holy and to be set apart for God's use—to be different. Our goal is not to be accepted; if you are a follower of Jesus, He has already told you that you will not be accepted. It makes common sense because you've been set apart to be used by God and to be used for God—to be used with God. The Scriptures teach that the world, where it is going, Jesus said ""Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it."" The majority of the world is defined by Jesus is common; what's common is not following Jesus. Jesus said ""But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.""

Holiness—how are you doing on a holiness scale? How are you at being set apart? How are you at being different? Peter defined it as being alien as a stranger in the world. Jesus said, 'Remember when they reject you, they rejected me first and when they hated you, they hated me first.' It's common. How are you doing on that scale? If I were to go to your co-workers; if I were to go to your classmates at school; if I were to go to your family; if I were to go to your friends and if I were to ask them ""How is Johnny doing on the Christian scale; how is he doing? Is he a Christian?"" Many of your friends; many of your family members or whoever would say ""Yeah, they go to church; they believe in God; they are Christian."" But if someone answers that question to me if I would ask that question or if you would ask that question on me, and they would answer, ""Yes, he is a Christian,"" it's all based upon what their perception of what a Christian is. I would bet a million bucks that if we were to go in this room today and take a survey and everybody had a sheet of paper, what does it mean to be a Christian, guess what?—we are going to get a lot of different answers. So just to ask your friends if you are a Christian, that really doesn't tell me anything because there are a lot of wicked people who said, 'I am a Christian.' Let me ask you this; ask a little bit different. What if I were to go to your family, or friends, co-workers, classmates, teammates and I were to ask the same question about you but a little bit differently. 'Let me ask you this about Johnny; is Johnny Holy? Is he set apart? Is he set apart for God's use? Does he use different language? Does he have different thoughts? Does he have different actions?' You see you leave the corners of your field unpicked and the guy who leaves 4 or 5 stalks in each corner and technically says, 'I left the corners unpicked' what God is saying is 'I want to see if you are set apart for my use. Where is your heart really?'

American business world today; is it Holy? Is it set apart for the divine? That's not the American business model; the American business model is not to leave the corners for people to come in and pick. The American business model is you must maximize every single dollar and every single dime and you suck as much of that up and put it away for yourself as much as possible. Why do you think America is crashing and burning? Because God's ways are Holy and we, too often, are common. The common is self-driven; the common is what can I get for me? The person who has the mindset of God approaches his fields as in 'my family only needs this much so I'm leaving the rest of it for other people who need it.' When we come on Sunday and we bring tithes and offerings, it's a parallel to bringing the corners of your fields or leaving the corners of your fields unpicked. It's saying, 'We as a church; we as a family want to help the needy in our area.' It's Angels' Attic! It's paying lots of money out of this congregation—lots of money in the last 10 or 15 years that we have poured out to fund Angels' Attic where people can come and get food and clothes and other stuff and not be charged for any of it in order to help them. People last weekend who gave tons of time—tons of energy—to spend on the Angels' Attic garage sale in here to raise money to help people. Friends, God wants people who are called Holy and set apart.

After I finished 1st service today I walked to the back over there and God pressed a passage of Scripture onto me—it used to be one of my favorites to go to and I hadn't even thought of it for this sermon or message—I couldn't believe it, and then I walked over to that side and stood for a while and I couldn't get it out of my mind. I walked down and the hallway back here to my office and it stayed in my mind and I came back around and there was a good place to tell Heather I had something else to say and so it's going to be a part of my message today. In Hebrews 12 the writer of Hebrews says this: ""Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be Holy; without Holiness no one will see the Lord."" Make every effort to live in peace and to be Holy—to be set apart—to be used for God's purposes. ""See to it that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many."" What the writer of Hebrews is saying here is to listen friends, if you've got an unforgiving spirit and there is bitterness in your heart and you've got stuff eating away at you and unresolved issues, it can keep you from holiness and ""without holiness no one will see God.""

You see, here's the thing. This is why in the Scriptures they came to see Jesus and said, 'Lord, Lord, didn't we do this and didn't we do that?'—and He said, 'Depart from me; I never knew you.' There is a holiness that is expected. Do you want to be like the world? If you want to hang with the devil, don't be upset when you hang with the devil. God doesn't send anyone to hell; we choose it. We choose life through His Son or we choose to be common and be with the rest of society. He says (JR repeated Verse 15 and continued reading through Verse 17.) 
Friends, God has called us to Holiness. The church needs to be different. Now I know it's hard because you have to find this happy medium, not of being 'unholy' but we have to live in this world. We have to be able to connect with people who are apart from God; if we don't connect with them relationally, then they're not going to find God. So there is this in-between area that we have to live and the writers of the Bible define it and they say 'be in the world but not of the world.' Be in the world but don't buy into the world's plan; don't be bought into the world's direction and when you have friends that you have conversations with, and they totally disagree with you and their ideas are contrary to what God teaches, it doesn't do any good to just sit there and call them names and tell them they are going to hell. Even though those things may be true, we have to build bridges and there has to be grace extended. Jesus extended grace in order to build relationships and that's where we need to be. We need to be in the world but not of the world. We need to walk through places and do what the Scriptures say. There needs to be the aroma of Jesus everywhere we go. I was teasing Naomi Kuhn out here a little while ago, cause her dad—she ran off for a little bit—she's 6—and when her dad picked her up he said, ""You smell like a donut."" I went over and sniffed her and I said, ""You bought that donut perfume; you've got a bottle of it at home and you squirted donut perfume on you,"" and she said, ""No, no, no, no, no."" Well, you know what?—this whole idea of perfume and Jesus is a connection point because Scriptures tell us that we need to have the aroma of Jesus that when we go into places there should be a sweetness about it—we should be different; we should bring a peace and a joy—we should be different than the rest of the world. When the rest of the world sees despair; when the rest of the world sees hopelessness, you need to be the light in the room because you are the light of the world. Let's pray.

Closing Prayer – God, thank you for being gracious with us. Thank you for loving us. Lord, thank you for sending your Son to die on a cross for us. Lord, we do not have the capacity to be Holy just because we decide to be different. We are at your mercy as we come and we surrender to you. Lord, that through the power of Jesus, He gives us the strength to be Holy, to be different. Lord, I pray for every person in here today. I pray that we understand that this is a big issue for without holiness, the Scriptures say, no one will see you. No one will spend eternity with you without holiness—without being set apart. So God, I pray today that as we get ready to sing, without any talk or without talking with Heather at all, as I looked to see what we were going to be singing after I was done, Lord, I'm reminded how gracious you are in leading us. God, I pray that if there is anyone here today who wants to accept you and that if there is anyone who wants to walk into the waters of baptism—Lord, to die to their old selves—to be connected with you—Lord, to have the feeling and the dwelling of the Holy Spirit and the forgiveness of sins and to have a relationship with you, Lord, I pray that today will be a day of salvation. Lord, thank you for every person here and for all their backgrounds, for all their struggles, for all their victories—Lord, I pray that you will teach us through those. In Jesus' Name we pray. Amen.

",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",5/15/2016,
"I want you to think about a time when you were most excited to see someone. Think about a time in your life when you were eager with anticipation to see someone. Now there are a lot of different scenarios in that. I will start it today and there are a few different times that pop into my mind when I was thinking about it this week but one for sure. I was standing in a place very similar to this. It was on June 2, 1989, when I was standing in a place very similar to this and it had been forever since I had seen my bride to be—I say forever, but it had been about 12 to 18 hours since I had seen her the day before—and I remember standing at the front of Draper Park Christian Church in Oklahoma City waiting and watching all the bridesmaids coming down the aisle and the groomsmen had walked up with me—I can't even remember that. But I remember thinking 'Would you just hurry up and get up here, because I want to see my bride.' And I remember when Leigh Ann walked into the doorway and they opened the doors and there she stood, and I remember the excitement and the anticipation. You know I already thought she was beautiful, but in that moment, she was just stunning to me, and the anticipation all day waiting for that, in some ways was nearly unbearable—part of it was unbearable because of the groomsmen and the guys I had been hanging out with. So I'm going to turn it over to you for a minute—men, I'm going to take you off the hook as I have already used that one, so if you have a different one—wives, don't throw elbows if they share something different. So give me a day—a time—a moment when you were filled with anticipation to see someone. Okay, I just heard someone say 'a child's birth.' That would have been where I would have gone next for myself. That is excitement to the max. And it doesn't have to necessarily be your own child. It could be a family member—just some birth you have anticipated and been excited about. Another one? 'A serviceman or servicewoman coming home' is another I just heard someone say. I'm sure you were filled with anticipation over that. Anyone have anything different from that? 'Coming back with an adoption of a child'—yet, that, too, is very exciting—a different way for a child to arrive. Anybody else? Yep, 'somewhere you had read about all your life and then finally getting there.' (Other things were mentioned but the audio was not clear.) There are things like that, aren't there, where we anticipate—I mean where you just can't wait because you are so excited—so excited. As a child, it might be Christmas and the cousins are coming over and you haven't seen them in a while and you're not so worried about planes coming in from overseas and that kind of stuff because you don't get that yet, but your cousins are coming and you know the next 24-48 hours you'll be in trouble, first of all, because it's going to be wild and crazy and you just anticipate it so much. On the other side of that, are there ever those moments that you've had where you had to—and I don't want to say 'confront' necessarily—or anything negative, although it could be negative, but you anticipate this interaction that is going to happen that you dread, or that you don't want to happen. You know that it's coming and a lot of times—I think the times that we really dread that are when we have done something. We have done something to hurt someone and now we have to be confronted with them. I'm not asking you to say those out loud today, but think in your mind about that a little bit about those situations. I know I have used it before but one that always pops into my mind when I think about this; I don't recall how old I was but probably in the 5-6-7 age range. I grew up in Columbus, IN and my family was having a cookout and my cousins were coming over. My dad grew up down in French Lick, in Southern Indiana, and my cousins' father grew up in Columbus, too, and we were getting together for an evening cookout. And one of their friends, who also lived down in French Lick—do you remember a few weeks ago I told the story about Bonds Chapel and I had to walk by it which had the magical tombstone that had a new chain link on the side of it every year? I was walking from this guy's house so this guy Ray—he was going to stop by our house; he is an older guy who has never been married; he's obviously single, no kids—he's going to stop by our cookout. He is a longtime friend of my uncle's and my dad and I. My cousins and I—we were playing and Ray pulls into the driveway; my house was right on Highway 31. I remember this crystal clear seeing him in his car pull into our driveway and came up the hill—there was a circle drive at the top. We were playing ""chase"" around my house; I was there hiding, waiting for someone to come chase me—Ray comes up and gets out of the car. He was like part of our family and at our house all the time. We were over at his place all the time and I thought he would get this but obviously he didn't. I looked at him and I said, ""Ray, what are you doing here; no one wants you here."" I was joking! About that time my cousin comes around the house and I take off running—running for my life, and probably 20 or 25 minutes later, at least in my mind—it might have been longer—I remember they called us together for dinner on the back patio and I remember crystal clear the conversation between my dad and my mom. My dad said to my mom, ""Where's Ray? I was in the house and I saw his car pull in the driveway, but I haven't seen him and his car isn't out there."" I heard this and I was thinking 'Uh, oh, that's not good.' Even at a young age, I was convicted—right when I heard that, I knew that I had made a mistake. You know, I liked Ray; he was my friend, so I remember being in tears and taking my mom—not my dad—but taking my mom into the house and telling her that this is what happened and this is what I had said and that I didn't know if he left because of what I had said but, in tears, I told her I was just joking. Well, I spent the rest of the evening in my room listening to my cousins running around the house playing and literally it was probably two hours later the phone rings (in the days before cell phones) and my mom comes and gets me from my room and says, ""There is somebody on the phone who wants to talk to you."" I knew who it was but I asked, ""Who is it?"" and she told me ""It's Ray"" and I remember the 45-minute walk from my room to the telephone; we had a big house when I was growing up. Well, it seemed like 45 minutes but it was only about 20 feet away and it was awful. I remember I had been in my room for 2 hours agonizing about having to have this conversation at some point. I was really glad that it was over the phone and not in person. I picked up the phone and said ""Hello,"" and Ray says to me ""Hey, I just wanted you to know something. Today's a lesson; I do love you and I do care about you but the reality is that my mom's sick and I wasn't staying anyway, but you need to understand you just can't say things like that to people."" I remember sitting there and with no breath and not knowing what to say. Most of us have had conversations like that or confrontations like that at some point where you dread it. Now it was awesome when it was over and he had restored me and he encouraged me and he told me that he knew we were friends and we were buds, etc., and everything was fine, but those are hard, hard moments.
Today we are talking about Acharei Mot which is Leviticus 16 through the end of Leviticus 18. Acharei Mot literally means ""after the death."" Leviticus 16 starts out talking about the death of Nadab and Abihu who we had seen earlier perish because they had approached the Lord with an inappropriate fire to offer sacrifice. These were the sons of Aaron and they lost their lives. That's what this portion begins with but this portion really for the sages and rabbis is all about Yom Kippur. Maybe you've heard that name—that term—that Jewish holiday—but you've never known what it was. Yom Kippur literally means ""Day of Atonement."" The Day of Atonement for the Jewish people is the Sabbath of Sabbaths. They have the Sabbath day at the end of the week—on the 7th day—and that's the day when they rest and that is a holy day and they had all the other feasts and everything that were considered Sabbaths and those were holy days, but Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, was the most holy day of the year. It was all the other Sabbaths amped up. I mean, on the Day of Atonement there was absolutely no work and different from the other Sabbaths. A lot of the other Sabbaths you could on Fridays do meal preparation and set it aside for Saturday, then you could get the food out on Sabbath and get it ready when you had done the major amount of work the day before, but not on Yom Kippur. On Yom Kippur there was no work and from Friday, sundown to Sunday sundown, it was a day of fasting—fasting from food and it was fasting from drink. It was the only day in the Jewish year that the High Priest could approach God. It concluded the 10 holy days of Israel. You see, 10 days before on Tishri 1, you have the celebration of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish year—the Jewish New Year. Rosh means the head of or the top of or the beginning of and Hashanah meaning the year. So on Tishri 1 which is normally in our September or October, it began with the shofar being blown which began the 10 days of awe for the Nation of Israel. They were 10 days of self-introspection; they were 10 days of repentance—they were 10 days when they focused on the past year of the areas where they had fallen short and the areas where they needed to do better. In traditional Jewish teaching—not Biblical teaching—they believed that during those 10 days God decides out of all creatures who will live and who will die during the next calendar year. So they are very much in the mindset and I share that with you because this is their mindset in approaching God—their mindset is what they need to do to be right with God—what they need to do to walk with God. Chapter 16 is all about Yom Kippur. Yom Kippur for the Jewish people was this: it was the holiest day of the year. It was the Holiest Day of the Jewish calendar year when the Holiest Man in the World goes into the Holiest Place in the World, and because they said that I think it is absolutely accurate. It's exactly what God said. God said that out of all the days on the Jewish calendar, Yom Kippur—He affirms it in this chapter, that it is the Holiest Day of the Year and it is at that time that the Holiest Man in the World—the High Priest of Israel—who has been set aside, or set apart by God will enter the Holiest Place in the World and that is to enter the Holiest Place, into the Holy of Holies, within the Temple. Remember, ""holy"" means to be ""set apart."" All of those things were set apart by God. There are some traditions that the High Priest, when he would go into the Holy of Holies, because the Presence of God was in there, that they would fasten bells to his garments so that when he went in, they would know everything was okay as when he was in there, he would jingle, but as far as I can find, I don't believe those traditions that we commonly hear with that, are accurate. I don't believe that he probably had bells tied to him. I do believe that the tradition of tying the rope to his leg, though, is accurate, because this is a problem. If the High Priest goes into the Holy of Holies, as Nadab and Abihu died, because they approached God inappropriately and that is what we find here in Chapter 16, Verse 1 because they approached God without being called. If the High Priest is in the Holy of Holies and God strikes him down, and he dies, then how do you get him out? You can't go in there so they would tie a rope to his ankle so that after a time if he doesn't come out, someone can pull him out. The High Priest would go in and he would offer sacrifices in the same pattern as we've seen in Exodus and Leviticus. He would offer sacrifices first on behalf of himself and his family and then for the Nation of Israel. Yom, Kippur, the Day of Atonement, is so holy that it impacts the Jewish life. Even today there are Jewish people who are not necessarily religious Jews who will set everything aside on the Day of Atonement and stop everything. In 1965 Sandy Koufax, who was a religious Jew, and observed the Jewish teaching; he refused to pitch Game 1 of the World Series because it fell on Yom Kippur—the best pitcher in the world tells Walter Alston, the Dodger manager, that he's not pitching because he's observing the High Holy Day of Yom Kippur. That job then fell to Don Drysdale so Don Drysdale pitches Game 1 for the Dodgers; he has a terrible outing. Walter Alston goes to get him off the mound; when he relieves the pitcher and sends him back to the dugout, it is said that Don Drysdale said to Walter Alston, ""Right now, I'll bet you were wishing that I was Jewish too.""

Jewish life shuts down on the Day of Atonement. That's why on October 6, 1973, on the Day of Atonement, Egypt along with Syria, with help from Iraq and Jordan and Tunisia, Sudan, and Morocco, attacked the Nation of Israel, knowing that they would be observing Yom Kippur—knowing that most of them will have left their posts because they are not allowed to work. Within 24 hours the Israelis were reeling. In the Golan Heights in the north, an area they had won in the 1967 Six-Day War, there were 150 Israeli tanks trying to fight off 1,400 Syrian tanks. Along with those 1,400 Syrian tanks there were 18,000 Iraqi soldiers and 3,000 Saudi soldiers. In the Suez there were 500 Israeli soldiers trying to hold off a barrage of 80,000 Egyptian soldiers. Needless to say, because of Yom Kippur and their lack of readiness for war, it was not going well. The war from the Arab standpoint was financed by Libya and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Within 24 hours the Nation of Israel was in trouble, but after Yom Kippur ended and they started to regather their bearings, they began to push back and the Israelis, at that time, actually pushed back to within 65 miles of Cairo, Egypt, and within 35 miles of Damascus, Syria.

I bring those things out because even the world knows—even their enemies know that the Day of Atonement is a day when the religious Jew shuts down. They know it's a day of God's reckoning so to speak. So in Chapter 16 we have this teaching of the Day of Atonement. It says this in Verse 3. (JR read it.) This is where it starts saying he is to bring the bull for himself for a sin offering and the ram for the burnt offering; first he has to deal with himself and his relationship with God and with his family and then it tells him what he is to do and what clothes he is to wear. It tells him he is to Mikvah, to be immersed. It tells him then he is to take 2 male goats for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering (Verse 5). It says in Verses 7-8 (JR read them.) So on the Day of Atonement, the High Priest of Israel would go in to the Holy of Holies; he would take a bull and he would take a goat and he would offer them for his family and then they would bring 2 more goats and these were for representation of the Nation of Israel. They would stand the goats in front of him and then in a closed box in front of him they would shuffle it up—that was the way they would cast lots; he would have a goat on his right and a goat on his left and he would reach into this box after they would shake it up and he would pull out a ribbon saying 'this one is for the Lord,' and he would take it and assign that ribbon to that goat. If he pulled it out with his right hand, it would go to the goat on his right—if he pulled it with his left, it would go to the goat on his left. Through this process this is how they would decide--this is how God would lay it out for them to decide which goat would be sacrificed and how it would be sacrificed. So one goat would be offered up as a sin offering on behalf of the people; the other goat was called the Azazel; its name is where we get our English word today that you are familiar with called ""scapegoat."" This goat became the scapegoat. One goat was offered as a sacrifice; the other goat, the Azazel—the scapegoat—he would take a scarlet cord and tie the scarlet cord around the goat's head. He would then cut off a piece of that same scarlet cord and he would tie it in the Temple—he would tie it there in the Temple courtyard for the people to see. He would then go to the scapegoat, the Azazel, and the High Priest would place both his hands on the goat and he would pray and he would symbolically take all of the sin of the Nation of Israel and he would put it upon this goat. Then there was someone who had been pre-picked who would take this goat and lead it out into the wilderness. The Scriptures teach that the goat was to go out into the wilderness and so they would take it out into the wilderness, but as time evolved, they inserted another little thing into this; they would take the goat way out into the wilderness, take its rear-end and put it towards a cliff and they would back it off the cliff. The reason was they were afraid the goat would wander around and eventually find its way back to Jerusalem bringing the sin of Israel back and because they were afraid of that, they would take this goat and they would back it over the cliff and the goat would plummet to its death.

There is a fascinating story that comes out of this; to me it's even more fascinating because it's not a Jesus story in the sense of it's not from the people who believe that Jesus was the Messiah that teach this story. There's a fascinating rabbinic teaching that goes with this; that when the goat was backed off of the cliff and died, that the scarlet cord that was around its neck miraculously would turn white, representing that their sin was white as snow. Not only that, but Josephus and other historians talk about that the cord that had been tied up in the Temple courtyard—they knew the goat had died because when the goat died, the cord in the Temple courts would turn white. The thing that is fascinating to me is this: the sages write that something mysterious happened with the scarlet cord. You see they didn't think of that being all that mysterious; to me that's pretty mysterious of what I have told you to this point. But the thing that they say is really mysterious was that right at 40 years before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, the scarlet cord quit changing white when they took the Azazel goat out and dumped him over the cliff. Let your mind run with that just a little bit. These Orthodox non-Jesus believing Jews teach that 40 years before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in A.D. 70, something within the life of Israel must have happened that caused the scarlet cord to not change color to white anymore.

Guess what happened 40 years before the destruction of the Temple? There was a crucified Savior in Jerusalem. The day of Yom Kippur is the Day of Atonement. It's the day that Paul talks about in Romans 3:25 when he says this: (JR read it.) It was through the death of Jesus on that Day of Atonement that the world was cleansed. It was on that Day of Atonement that the sin that stained my life was washed as pure and as white as snow. It was on that day that Jesus became the person that I am most excited to meet. As excited as I was to stand at the front of the Draper Park Christian Church and await the arrival of my bride, I'm even more so eager to see the coming of the Bridegroom. I'm even more eager to see—you know of all the dreams I have ever had in my life—I remember it's probably been about 12 or 13 years ago, I had a dream one night that woke me up and it was just so real? It was the sky splitting open and the trumpets blaring and I woke up right before the appearance of Jesus; I was so mad and I was so irritated but it was so real—so vivid, and I was so excited. But because I have the excitement of seeing Jesus, along with that there comes a little bit of dread. Some people don't ever think in those terms; we just think about our excitement for Jesus to wipe every tear away from our eyes but the Scriptures say that we should fear God and it is for that first time—that first moment when we see God, the reality of who Jesus is will set in--His Holiness; His Righteousness and the fear in our hearts. Now I believe He has the ability to overcome the fear of our hearts but we don't really know what Holiness is really. What we see is a shadow of what's supposed to be. We don't know what Righteousness is, really, because everything we experience in some way or another is tied to sin because the world is so filled with sin, but when Jesus comes, our excitement to see Him mixed with the fear of the reality of who we are in His Presence will be mind-numbing. I hope and I pray that you are ready; I hope and I pray that you are ready and you have accepted the sacrifice of our scapegoat—the one that was not backed out into the desert and backed down a cliff, but the One who was led up a hill carrying a cross so that He might take your sin and provide forgiveness. Let's pray.

Closing Prayer – Abba, thank you. Thank you for being our sacrifice. Thank you for bringing atonement and thank you for paying what we owe. Lord, I pray that as we look forward and anticipate the day of the arrival of Jesus for the second time—Lord, I pray that we might be ready. Lord, I pray that by faith we would trust you. I pray that we would understand more fully these pictures in the Torah of who it is that Jesus is—these pictures of how He fulfilled your purposes within these sacrifices. God, I pray that if there is anyone in here today who needs to release themselves, who needs to surrender, who needs to trust you, Lord, I pray that today will be a day of salvation for them. Lord God, thank you for Jesus and for His sacrifice and for His love and for His mercy. Thank you for His judgment and for His compassion. Lord, it's in His Name that we pray. Amen.",JR Moffatt,"Arcadia, IN",5/8/2016,
"I wonder sometimes if that is entirely true. My wife and I lived in Tel Aviv for about 7-8 months in 2007-2008 and when we returned to Oklahoma City to our own town and attending amongst our own congregation, which is the same congregation that Leigh Ann and I grew up in where our dad pastored for 35 years, but now there was a new Pharaoh in town—a new preacher—and he was a good guy but I'll never forget that Sunday—my wife and I sat over near where my mom used to play the piano (probably for sentimental reasons we sat there) but the minister began his message by talking about and asking the questions ""What is your favorite part of the Bible"" and ""What is your favorite book?"" People were giving different answers and then there became a really awkward moment as he kind of mocked one book of the Bible when he asked, ""How many people like the Book of Leviticus?"" My wife and I were sitting over there, probably the only people, and I never felt so alone in a congregation as we cautiously raised our hands in affirmative. As the song we just sang says, ""Everywhere I see you . . . ."" But do we? Because I see Him in Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy and also Joshua, Judges, and from the very beginning to the end, it's all about Yeshua, the Messiah; it's all about Jesus. So if we truly believe that song phrase, we would never jokingly mock about the Book of Leviticus because He is on every page and my hope and my prayer today is that somehow I can show you that. It's so cool to be at a church where I can actually preach on Leviticus. Do you know how hard it is to be a guest speaker and the home preacher asks ""What are you going to speak on?"" and you respond Leviticus? There is only one other book in the Bible that causes pastors more fear and concern and that is if you tell him you are going to speak on Revelation. The response typically is, ""Oh, Brent, things have been going really well, so you don't want to do that."" You see we are intimidated by what is in this book but I love this book—Vayikra—that's the Hebrew name. It is the first word of the book and JR has probably already talked to you about that the first word or words in the first line becomes the name of the book. Vayikra simply means 'and He called.' This book begins with God calling to Moses and saying to speak to the sons of Israel because God had something to say to His children. I love this book! People ask me, ""Brent, why do you love to preach from the book of Leviticus?"" My answer is ""Because I love to preach about grace.""

I want to help you understand today just how important this book is. I want to turn to Hebrews first and read Chapter 7, Verse 11. The writer of this book says something that is truly amazing and absolutely mindboggling. He's talking about the priesthood and he's kind of setting it up for us to understand the Levitical priesthood will give way to Jesus coming in as the great High Priest and he's talking about the Torah, the Law, and he says this. (Brent read this.) Now perfection in that context for if the Levitical priesthood could have brought us to that final, fulfilled place where God wanted us to be, then if that perfection was through the Levitical priesthood, then there would have been no reason for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek instead of the order of Levi and Aaron. When it says ""the people will receive the Torah,"" that is a mindboggling statement that most people read right past. I want you to understand why it is so significant. Because if God had just given the Law with Commandments and punishments, if you broke them, without giving the priesthood, all he would have given to Israel was condemnation. He would have been setting them up to be driven further from His presence. He could have never given the Law without the mitigating influence of the priesthood and the altar service. This is one of the biggest earliest pictures of God's grace and mercy. You see, without the priesthood and the altar service all we would have known is condemnation. A lot of people scratch their heads when I start talking about the Law as a vehicle of grace but I want to prove it to you from John 1:17. (Brent quoted it.) Did you hear what John just said? The giving of the Law was an act of God's loving kindness, His mercy and His grace because we have all received one revelation of grace leading to more revelations of grace. How many of you have thought about the Law as grace? That's because you were taught incorrectly. You see, when God gives you something—do you give gifts to your children so you can condemn them? Or do you give gifts to your children to reveal your love in your heart for them? Doesn't that make more sense? The giving of the Law was God's first act of grace. Now you need to understand that John is following a Hebrew model of teaching; it's called a Kal V'chomer; Kal means ""easy""; chomer means ""heavy."" He's moving from a light to a heavy; from a lesser to a greater and he is saying 'We've all received a revelation of God's grace,' but God's grace always moves to the better—from light to heavy. It's important for us to understand that because sometimes we envision it as a cage-match—I actually preached it like that when I was a young minister. The Law came through Moses BUT GRACE CAME THROUGH JESUS CHRIST. You know, when Jesus came, He slam-dunked Moses. Hmmm—what we read as conflict, John is trying to show you as chronology, from one revelation of grace to an even greater revelation of grace. You see that's why I can't come to the book of Leviticus and only see law—only see legality. God is calling to the human heart. He is calling Israel to see Himself in an all-new way. Everywhere I go, I see you . . . . Pray with me now that the Lord will reveal Himself that we will see Him as He calls to us these millennia later still calling to us to draw near to Him. Let's pray.

Opening Prayer – Abba Father, thank you so much for the privilege of standing before these—your people. Will you come now, Father, and do and undo what other preachers have sewn into our hearts and minds that have blinded us and blocked us from being able to see Him. Let us see Jesus—let us see your heart today; call to us for we are listening. I pray this in Jesus' Name. Amen.

Alright, I want to tell you what I want to do today. I know you have been going through the Torah and I hope that I don't rob any of JR's thunder because I know you are about halfway through the book of Vayikra, but today I want to show you something. I don't want to make this sound arrogant but I honestly believe that I'm going to show you something today that's going to change your view of this book and it's going to give you a means to understand this book and never be afraid of it again. I'm going to talk to you today about what I call the ""axial subject"" of this book. Now when you think about ""axial"" you are thinking about the wheel with a spoke and everything goes around that central hub and what I want to share with you today is there is a topic in this book that if you don't understand it is the axial subject of this book, then you will never really understand all the interconnectedness of sometimes this seemingly weird and disjointed subjects that God talks about in this book. But before we go to the book of Leviticus, I need to remind you of man's condition. If Leviticus is part of the cure, we need to understand what is broken. When you go to Genesis 3 you will remember that it is discovered that Adam and Eve have eaten from the tree of knowledge of good and evil which they were not to eat from and then listen as I read from Genesis 3:21-24. (Brent read the passage.) What a picture of grace! Huh? He drove them out because He was a mad and angry God—no! Because He knew that if we reached out and ate from the tree of life in our sinful condition, we would become eternally non-redeemable! And He loved us too much to let that happen. Parents, did you punish your kids because you didn't love them or did you punish your kids because you did? You see, this is a picture of God's grace. He's protecting us. But I want you to focus today—we're going to juxtapose two things today and the first one is this. It is man's condition that man after he eats from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, his sin is uncovered and his nakedness is exposed so God literally drives him out, and I want you to have this picture of man being driven out of being exiled from Eden, but God didn't do it to send us away forever. Man was sent into exile until God would have a way to bring us home.

I love the story of Abraham because he's the first exile called by faith who heard the call of God, believed His word and began to make that journey of faith out of the exile back home. So how is God going to change this condition of being ""driven out?""—how is He going to draw us near? Well, that's where the book of Leviticus comes in. That's where the priestly service and the altar service—I remember I was sitting in a Sunday School class in my home church and a good friend of mine was teaching and I had been really quiet and had kept my mouth shut but I just came unglued one day when he was reading from a commentary about the altar and it referred to the altar as ""the bloody ritual."" And I said ""Excuse me, the bloody ritual?"" Was there blood involved—yes. How many of you--we are a couple months away from the 4th of July—how many of you on July 4 are going to have a ""bloody ritual?"" No? You're not going to send out invitations saying 'We are going to have an all-church bloody ritual?' That's how you've been taught to view the altar, but you don't view a barbeque that way, do you? You see you send out invitations to a barbeque because you're going to take meat and you're going to put it on a fire and you're going to gather your friends together and you're going to have a time of celebration and fellowship and intimacy and you're never going to think about the fact that it's a bloody ritual, even though the animals on that fire gave their lives for you. Do you see the problem?

You see I have a professor who once said that God borrowed the altar service from the pagans because that was all that Israel knew. God does not borrow from paganism—amen? It's not a bloody ritual. The altar service was about man's greatest need—remember what that is? Man has been driven out. So how is man then to draw near? That's where the story really begins to get interesting. Fellowship is to be restored at the altar of God. Now, the axial subject that we're going to talk about today is this: the blood—life is in the blood. If you don't understand that, you will never understand the things the book of Leviticus talks about, and I want you to repeat after me: Life is in the blood, and it doesn't belong to me. What does Leviticus teach us? Life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to me. When I ask you 'What does Leviticus teach us?' what will you say? Life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to me. That's the axial subject of the book of Leviticus. That is this revelatory understanding that allows mankind to begin the process of coming home. We were driven out because we took life—where is life? Life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to me. We reached out and we took our lives into our own hands, but life doesn't belong to us; it belongs to our Creator. And so God created a way to show us how to come home. Now Leviticus 1 begins with these words ""And the Lord God called to Moses, from the Tent of Meetings saying, 'Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. When you present an animal as an offering to the Lord, you may take it from your herd of cattle or your flock of sheep and goats.'"" There is a Hebrew word I want you to understand and know that it gets used as a noun and it gets used as a verb. It is the Hebrew word ""karav"" and in this sentence when it says when you bring—the Hebrew word is karav which means when you draw near. And then when it says when you draw near with your offering, noun, the Hebrew is korban—same word—same 3-letter root word. God says when the people want to draw near to me, they draw near to me with an offering of drawing near.

Then He goes into a description of the types of animals that are allowed to be brought to the altar where man can draw near to God and He gives him 5 types of offerings, and I know JR has already talked about them so we're not going into them today but the thing I want you to understand is they are all voluntary. You didn't have to bring any of them. These were offerings like the ""olah"" or the burnt offering—olah means the ""going up""—this was an offering where you would take your sacrifice—it was like if you were to go on a great trip and you came home and the Lord had blessed your journey and you wanted to celebrate the prosperity and the safety that God had brought you—you would bring an olah to the offering and you would gather your friends and when you gave that offering, part of the meat would go to the priest, and the portion that belonged to God—the blood and the entrails—what does Leviticus teach us? Life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to me. That's the Lord's portion; that's what is poured out on the altar. But then you would take some of the meat back and gather your friends at this great celebratory feast and God said this is voluntary; you say, Brent, what about a sin offering or a guilt offering? Well, you couldn't take that home and celebrate that because you're not supposed to benefit from your sin, but the priest did. They ate from your sacrifice. The whole point was that God gave you a way—if you wanted to elevate yourself above the carnality of your flesh—if you wanted to say to God, 'I want to be drawn near; I'm tired of being driven out,' you would approach with a korban, and then you would have a meal—a fellowship because who you sit at the table with matters. I remember the first time I went to Israel, we had a 3-day extension in Paris and we went to a McDonald's and they had these stand-up tables and I got my food—a big MacRoyale or something weird like that, and I sat down and the next thing I know, this French guy who I had never seen before came and sat down at my table and I said, 'whoa, whoa, whoa.' There is an American space bubble around me—you are committing a social faux pas. Can you imagine going into an American restaurant and if there is no place to sit, you just go sit down with strange people? They would look at you with shock on their faces and probably say, 'this is our table,' because a table is a place of fellowship. It's a place of intimacy. I don't just sit at any man's table. If you invite me to come to your house and sit at your table, that is a high honor and if I ask you to come sit at my table and fellowship with me, I am asking you to draw near and God says to Israel, 'I'm inviting you to my table but this is how you do it; you can use these animals for these reasons, but when you do, and it doesn't matter whether it is a bull or a goat or whatever, make sure you know this: life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to you.' The blood will go on the altar because it belongs to God.

Leviticus 7-10 God begins to instruct who will handle the blood and He sanctifies the descendants of Levi. You know, this book is called Leviticus from the Greek Leviticon which means the laws and the rules of the priesthood. God chose this tribe of Levi to be the ones to handle this, and I love the fact that He chose Levi because when Leah gave birth to Levi, you will remember that she felt unloved by Jacob but after bearing him a 3rd son, she thought, 'Now surely Jacob's heart will be joined to me,' so she named him Levi (joined). Unfortunately, it didn't work out exactly how she had hoped, but these people who God chose—they were the people that were descended from this man who had been named for this idea of being attached. In fact, his name comes from the Hebrew word Lavah and every time I see it I can't help but think—Lavah, where do we get our word ""love?"" What is love?—being joined to somebody. God sanctifies the priesthood to be the ones who handle the blood at the table to be His representatives at the table and the sages of Israel teach something very interesting, especially now in the absence of the Temple. They say 'in the absence of the altar, your table stands in as the altar of God.' Really? The first time I heard that I thought 'That's crazy.' And then the Holy Spirit knocked on my heart a little bit and said Remember this one? 'Behold I stand at the door and knock and any man who hears my voice, my calling, I will open the door and come in and sit with him and I will dwell with him.' Intimacy! 'I'll sit at his table.' I thought maybe the sages of Israel aren't so far off. By the way, we don't bless our food. You can bless a Big Mac from now to Kingdom come and it ain't going to nourish your body. It's going to do something to it, but it ain't going to be nourishment. It might give you enough fat supply to survive another few days, but we don't bless the food. If you were there at the Seder last night, not once did we bless the food. We said, ""Blessed be the LORD."" We give thanks to God for the blessing of the food because He's invited us to His table. We were driven out because we ate in a manner that showed we were taking our lives in our own hands, but God created a place where we could be drawn near to His table, to bow down and to acknowledge the central truth that life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to me. Do you remember what we did in Eden? We took our lives into our own hands, and where is life? Life is in the blood. Is this beginning to make sense? You see what you do with the blood of the sacrifice is the antithesis of what Eve did in the Garden of Eden; it demonstrates—it manifests—it shows that you want to come and draw near to God and to give Him what is not yours—life!

Leviticus 11 talks all about the laws of kosher—I wish I could have heard that message. God has just given you the rules about what you can bring to His table, now God turns around and tells Israel what they can eat at their table. What is the axial subject?—blood! What makes something kosher or not kosher?—blood! You don't eat carnivorous animals because carnivorous animals eat blood. Can you eat blood? What does Leviticus teach us? Life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to you. The other animals—their digestive process deals with it differently. Life is in the blood—I just want you to understand why God gave this command to Israel. It was a blood issue. You shall not consume blood. Remember Genesis 9? Remember what God told Noah? Life is in the blood and you shall not consume it. You say, 'Well, Brent, that's Old Testament.' Well, look at Acts 15, where the council in Jerusalem dealt with circumcision; the reason they would never have said that Gentile men had to be circumcised to be saved because it would have confused the whole plan of salvation. Am I saved by the shedding of my blood, or am I saved by the shedding of His? And then they give 4 more blood rules. #1 You will not consume meat sacrifice to idols—why? Because its blood has been poured out to a pagan god. Life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to you, and it certainly doesn't belong to a false god. #2 You will not eat blood. #3 You will not eat meat strangled—why? Because meat strangled has blood in it. #4 You shall not commit fornication—sexual immorality. Have you ever wondered why meat sacrificed to idols and sexual immorality are always paired in Scripture? Well, we are about to find out. God said, 'These animals are acceptable on my table, and these are the ones acceptable on yours.'

And then you go into Leviticus 12 and the women all get offended because after the woman gives birth to the child or when she's in her monthly cycle, you're not supposed to touch her. The Bible says she is unclean and people think, 'Aw, that's just terrible that you would treat her that way.' Let me ask you a question. When the High Priest on the Day of Atonement was going to handle the blood of sacrifice, could you touch the High Priest?—no! Why? Because he was handling the blood and it's holy. When a woman is in her cycle or when the laws that God gave Israel for after a child was born, this was not to demean women. Women have this very unique special place in the plan of life; you handle the blood of life. Men—husbands—we treat our wives as sacred during that time. The rest of the time, you can do as you---NO! Just kidding; you see, I can get away with that when the wife doesn't come with me. Anyway, what I'm trying to say is 'Don't look at those commandments as oh, that's terrible—God is oppressing Israel's women'—No, He's elevating your role. He gave you the place and the sanctification and the bringing forth of life and that's exactly what the High Priest is doing when he goes to the Temple. He is bringing blood to the altar so that Israel can be preserved and you have brought forth life. Do you see the picture? There is nothing demeaning about it, but you're handling the holy and until that's done, we treat you as sacred.

You see, the book of Leviticus is not exactly what you thought it was. Leviticus 17—after Leviticus 16 God gives the commandments for the Day of Atonement and Leviticus 17—we're drawing near to the end here so I want to make some important connections. Leviticus 17:10 says this: (Brent read the verse.) You think God doesn't take this seriously? What does Leviticus teach us? Life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to me. God says, 'You're not going to do it.' (Brent then continued reading through Verse 13.) By the way, if you are a hunter, don't you dare teach your sons or daughters to drink the blood of an animal you've just killed. Don't you do it. LIFE IS IN THE BLOOD AND IT DOESN'T BELONG TO ME. It's an abomination. God makes it so clear. (Brent then read Verse 14.) My friends, are you beginning to understand the axial subject of this issue. We were driven out because we took life in our hands and we sinned against the blood that was within us, but God says 'I want to draw you home.' But we can't come home until we know that life is in the blood, which means I can't draw near if I'm going to tell the Lord this is my life and I'm going to use it however I want. Let me juxtapose two things for you. You see on one side of the altar there are these 2 pictures: we were driven out because we ate and took our lives into our own hands; we were exposed as naked and ashamed, but God covered us with garments of skin, and He drove us out of His presence. But God created a place—a holy place—where men could draw near with a meal and place the blood on the altar to return life to His Hands; there we find a covering—an atonement for our sin and we are drawn near and forgiven. Do you understand why Israel was to come to the altar? When you come to the altar, you are bringing your life to the altar and God says, 'I have provided blood as a covering for you,'—by the way, who does the blood belong to?—God! God has given His portion to you for a covering.

Earlier I asked you a question, do you ever wonder why sexual immorality is always paired with meat sacrifice to idols. Well, after Leviticus 17 there is an amazing statement about atonement. What do we go into?—the laws of sexual purity. Thankfully, I don't see any little ones in here so I can speak openly. Sexuality is about what you do with the life blood within you. Without the flow of blood, there is no intimacy. God is telling Israel and us, 'If you want to draw near to me, you are going to have to show that you understand that the life that is within you is not yours and you cannot join it to anybody else if you want to join yourself to me.' You can join yourself to that one person that is within permissible to the Lord.

Leviticus 18 – what is the first thing that is forbidden? You shall not marry a close relative. I love this; you shall not draw near to uncover the nakedness of a close relative. You shall not draw near to uncover. When we come to the altar what are we doing? We are drawing near so we can be covered. Do you understand what sexual immorality is? It is one of the ultimate expressions of man saying, Life is in the blood and I'll do with it whatever I darn well please. Now technically I could have not used the euphemism there because the Hebrew word for blood is dom. What is damnation? It is the condemnation of a life that used the life God had given to join it and to use it however they wanted. You see, my friends, if you understand the altar and if you understand that God is giving us a picture that there are two ways of life: those of us who were driven out who are exiled—we have a place where we can draw near but if you're going to draw near, you have to understand that when we took life into our own hands, we have to say to the Father, 'I understand now that life is in the blood and it never belonged to me. I want to draw near; I want to bring an offering to you and I want to place the blood of the lamb on the altar because I understand it's what I do with the blood that shows whether I understand who He is.' If I take my body and I join it to a prostitute, a close relative, I commit sexual immorality; it is the antithesis—the antithetical picture of what God is trying to show us on the altar and what is the altar? It is the table of God and that's why throughout Scripture, even to the final letters of Revelation, you will see these two subjects paired together: sexual immorality and meat sacrifice to idols, because it's all about what you're doing with the blood.

The writer of Hebrews said something amazing. The law could never have been given without the mitigating priest on the altar. God would never have driven us out if He didn't have a way to draw us near. How do we draw near?—by how you handle the blood of the sacrifice. The writer of Hebrews is making this point: if you can understand how the first covenant required a priesthood, then you can understand how the new covenant requires an even greater High Priest, and a greater sacrifice. Because you see the blood of bulls and goats and lambs—that's a powerful way to say to God 'I understand who you are,' but ultimately to attain the atonement that is eternal, you have to partake in God's portion. 'I have given you blood upon the altar for a covering.' You can live your life using your life to uncover people's nakedness, leading them further into sin and drive them further away or by the blood of the sacrifice, you can show to the Father that you understand life is in the blood and we're talking about the blood of Jesus—Amen? Life is in the blood—do you remember we talked last night at the Seder about the first tree—we reached out to a living tree and God invites us to a death tree and He says, 'Take, eat, and live.' It is what you do with the blood of the sacrifice and that is why Jesus said, ""I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life and no man can come to the Father except through me."" Why?—because He is the blood of the sacrifice.

What will you do with Him? He shed His blood so you can live. What will you do with the life that He has given you? As a born-again believer I love the passage that JR read written by Rich Mullins—we do these things because this life within us belongs to Him and I want to draw near. I don't want to be driven out; I want to find my place at the table of God. Isn't it interesting that God told Israel the way to never forget is to every year come to a table and remember how the blood of the Lamb saved you in Egypt? And every week we come to a table where we partake of the unleavened bread and the fruit of the vine and we remember how the Lord covered our sinfulness.

Is Leviticus a little less scary? Life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to us. He shed His blood so we could live. What we do with His life in us—well, that will determine whether we are drawing near or whether we're driven out. As we approach the season of ministry, if you've never accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and been born again calling on His Name and passing through the waters of immersion, I want you to understand what that is all about. It's you saying to the Lord, 'Life is in your blood, and you shed it for me. I'm giving my life back to you.' That's what being born again means. But I suspect that there are times in your life—in fact, there may be someone in here today and you've given your life over to sexual immorality. Maybe it's through pornography on a computer; maybe it's through an illicit behavior that you know you're not supposed to be with. Maybe it's not anything that extreme; maybe it's you have been living your life your way; it's been all about you and not about Him. It's been about 'Hey, it's my life and I want to live it the way I want,' or maybe you find yourself saying 'Oh, goodness, this life doesn't belong to me and you just need a place and a moment to just say to the Father, 'I drifted; I wondered why I felt so distant from you, but now I want to draw near and I just want to say to you today, Father, this life isn't mine.' Maybe you just need a season of repentance. If you have a decision there are those waiting back under the flag to assist you but maybe you just need to come forward and fall on these steps to just have a private time with the Lord saying, 'Lord, draw me near.' The rest of us don't need to know how you've drifted; you just need a place and a time to say to the Lord 'This life is not my own, and I'm done treating it that way.' Whatever the Lord leads on your heart today, I pray you leave this place knowing this: Life is in the blood and it doesn't belong to us, and if we will draw near to Him, when He returns, we will live again. Let the spirit speak to you—listen—Vayikra—the Lord may be calling to your heart to join Him today.",Brent Avery,"Arcadia, IN",5/1/2016,
"Until I sat down to work on this sermon this week, I had never noticed the strong
parallel between the three temptations of Jesus at the very beginning of his earthly ministry,
and the three taunts at the very end of that ministry. In the 27th chapter of Matthew, as Jesus
suffers on the cross, we read these words:
39Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads 40and saying, “You who would
destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God,
come down from the cross.” 41In the same way the chief priests also, along with the
scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying, 42“He saved others; he cannot save himself.
He is the King of Israel; let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in
him. 43He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he wants to; for he said, ‘I am God’s
Son.’” 44The bandits who were crucified with him also taunted him in the same way.1
The earthly story of Jesus ends with three taunts: the first from some passersby; the second
from crowing religious leaders; the last from the two bandits hanging to his left and right.
Even though the language used by the devil in the wilderness is not exactly the same, his
three temptations of Jesus clearly have the same gist: Jesus, save yourself! When the devil
comes along, Jesus has been wandering and fasting in the wilderness. For forty days he has
eaten nothing. He is exhausted, weak and famished when the devil comes to call...
""Jesus, you need some bread. Make some appear, and save yourself!""
""Jesus, I've lifted you up to a precarious position. You are now hanging from a high place in
Jerusalem. Get yourself down, and save yourself!""
""Jesus, the whole world can be yours. Engineer your own accession, and save yourself!""
Three temptations at the beginning, mirrored by three taunts at the end, all pushing Jesus to
surrender to the very human inclination to take things into our own hands.
Many of you know that there is a group in our church currently working to discern a
future vision for our ministry. One of the things the Strategic Planning Vision Team has already
discussed at length is an apparent lack of energy and engagement. They have noticed fewer and
fewer people coming to worship; noticed that it is hard to get volunteers for children's church or tending the Gracious Greens garden; noticed that it is getting more and more difficult for
folks to say ""yes"" to invitations to serve. We have talked before about some of the reasons why.
As we said in our sermon series last summer, ""the struggle is real."" But it seems that all the
reasons we can name for this trend tend to unravel down to one common thread: we are tired.
The old 20/80 rule of ministry -- the observation that twenty percent of the people in a church
do about eighty percent of the work -- is just wearing people out.
In two separate retreats during the past week, elders and others engaged in the strategic
planning process spent a full day with ""In Christ Supporting Ministries,"" a validated ministry of
the Presbytery of Charlotte, and those ministers reminded us of some very old theology in those
retreats. The essence of their lesson was that, put simply, we do NOT save ourselves. That
sounds obvious enough. We know that only God can save, that we cannot work ourselves into
salvation. But that has not stopped us from trying. Somehow, the church always seems to find
its way back to creating a list of stuff that we have to do. Even as we say that the only thing on
that list is ""to have faith,"" ""to believe"" or simply ""to accept Jesus,"" we quickly expand that idea
into a catalog of boxes we have to check in order to get to God. We can't seem to resist the
temptation to reduce salvation down to a ""do-it-yourself"" proposition.
It reminds me of the guy who went to a local repair shop when his computer printer
began to fail. ""I've changed the toner,"" he tells the man behind the counter, ""but I can still barely
see the text.""
""We see this all the time,"" says the repairman. ""It just needs to be cleaned. We can do
that for you for $50, but you could just get some cleaning solution and try it yourself.""
The customer was happily surprised by the candid answer. ""Does your boss know
you're telling people that?"" he asked. ""You probably give away a lot of business.""
""Actually, it's my boss's idea,"" the employee replied. ""We usually make more money on
repairs when people try to fix 'em themselves first.""2
It is true – when we get in over our heads in our attempts to do things ourselves, we can
really mess stuff up. And that is what we've done to faith in the church. When we mistakenly
believe that God is only going to come so far, that we have to somehow climb up in our own
power to grab the life line that God is lowering down to us, we turn faith into a relentless
treadmill. We run for a while to try and catch up to God... then we get tired, or we trip up and
fall... then we beat ourselves up for not doing faith well... and so we resolve to run better, faster
and longer the next time. And pretty soon, we find that we are exhausted.
This was the reminder that we received from ""In Christ Supporting Ministries."" A great
deal of what we do here in the church rests on the assumption that, to use their words, ""if it is to
be, it is up to me."" If we are going to have children's church this week, then it is up to me. If we
are going to make the budget, then it is up to me. If I don't take care of this situation, then no
one else will. If it is to be, it is up to me.
Note that this is the very same temptation that the devil used on Jesus.
I know God will feed you, but why wait when you can make some magic bread now?
I know God will catch you, but you'll never know until you jump.
I know God has predestined you to rule the world eventually, but why don't you go ahead
and take control right now?
Take control, Jesus. It is up to you. Save yourself! In the two discernment sessions we had over the past week, some things became very
clear for me. We really are tired. We are tired of running on the treadmill of ministry, the one
that says, if we want Jesus to show up, then we have to have all the right programs, teach all the
right lessons, preach the right words, sing the right songs in the right way. I think we are tired
of looking at numbers that suggest the church is dying. We are tired of wondering why people
are not showing up. And all of that fatigue is related to the lie that we somehow keep finding
our way back to -- the idea that we have to save ourselves.
At the very beginning of his ministry, at the very end of his ministry, and at all times in
between, Jesus modeled the idea that it is not up to us. We don't have to bring God here; God is
already here. In this place, God is already working. In this place -- right here, right now -- God
is in this moment loving and serving and feeding and sheltering and empowering and
glorifying. At the beginning and the end, the alpha and the omega, the first and the last, Jesus
lives out the reality that we can rest in the assurance that God is active and present, and that we
do not have to save ourselves.
To the hunger of Jesus, the tempter said, ""You need bread, so save yourself!"" In faith,
Jesus replied, ""God's care is not conditional; God will give us what we need.""
To the weakness of Jesus, the tempter said, ""Prove who you are, and save yourself!"" And
Jesus replied, ""God's salvation is not a test; we do not need to jumpstart it.""
To the destiny of Jesus, the tempter said, ""The world can be yours, if you just go out and
grab it. Save yourself!""
And Jesus replies, ""Do not worry, little flock. Do not keep striving for the things you think
rely upon you. Do not keep worrying. Your Father in heaven knows what you need. Just keep
your eyes open for what God is already doing for you, around you and in you.”
This work is not up to us. This work is for us. At times, we will be able to participate in
that work. At times, we will only be able to watch -- and be amazed. Either way, Jesus says, “Do
not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.""
Thanks be to God. Amen.",Peter Bynum,"Concord, NC",3/5/2017,
"In the second epistle of Peter, one gets the feeling that the flame of Christianity is
flickering. The light of the church is being challenged by false prophets and teachers, clever
saboteurs who are injecting doubts and ""destructive opinions"" into the minds of believers. The
author of the book is concerned that these negative thoughts are slowly but steadily breaking
down the confidence of the Christian mind like the drip-drip-drip of Chinese water torture.
""Many will follow their licentious ways,"" he warns, ""and because of these teachers the way of truth
will be maligned... in their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words"" (2 Peter 2:2-3).
This text comes to us on this Sunday of the Transfiguration because one of the lies these
false teachers were spreading related to that event, the hour when Jesus was transfigured
before Peter, James and John, suddenly appearing in dazzling white with a vision of Moses and
Elijah. As the church wrestled with the meaning of the Transfiguration, it came to be primarily
understood as evidence of Jesus' eventual return in the final judgment. This claim was one of
the main targets of the false teachers. ""Those old stories are just myths and fables,"" they would
say. ""Your god was never really here, and your friend Jesus is not coming back.""1 Against these
subversive assaults, this letter, purporting to be from Peter himself, means to remind the
church that the story of the Transfiguration is not a myth or fable, but something that was
actually seen and related by three trustworthy eyewitnesses. ""We do not speak to you of
cleverly devised myths,"" the author writes. ""Remember that we were on the mountain. We saw
the Lord, and we actually heard God's voice say, 'This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am
well pleased.'""
Until very recently, I had never heard the term ""gaslighting,"" but when it kept appearing
in TV reports and online news, I finally looked it up. I found that ""gaslighting"" is a form of
psychological abuse that purposefully erodes the mental confidence of the victim. With a steady
stream of lies, denials, misdirections and contradictions, a gaslighter causes the victim to
question his or her own perceptions and judgments.
2 Eventually, the victim becomes
completely dependent upon the abuser, tacitly accepting the view of reality that the manipulator seeks to impose. 3 As Lutheran minister Leah Schade has said, the purpose of a
gaslighter is to make it seem that what we know to be true is not true.4
The term was first made popular by the 1944 movie ""Gaslight,"" starring Ingrid Bergman.
Her character Paula is swept off her feet by Gregory, a man whose real purpose in marrying her
was to get back into the house previously owned by Paula's aunt. Gregory had murdered the
aunt in an attempt to steal some priceless jewelry, but his heist had been interrupted before he
could find the prize. Paula, who agrees to move back into the house with her new husband,
begins to notice strange things happening. Gregory hides things and accuses Paula of stealing
them. He pretends that they have had conversations they never had. Day by day, he slowly
loosens her grip on reality with his lies and manipulations.
The movie gets its title from one of the most frequent lies he tells to her. Each night,
when Paula believes her husband has gone out, he sneaks up into the attic to search for the
jewels. And each evening, Paula notices that the lights in the house dim. She cannot explain
why. Even though she can plainly see the flame of the lights go down, Gregory tells her she is
just imagining it. It is a bald-faced lie, because Gregory knows that the lights are dimming. He
knows that the lamps he is turning on in the attic are diverting gas away from the lights
throughout the rest of the house, reducing their flames. He knows that what she is seeing is
true. Poor Paula, however, is bullied -- or ""gaslighted"" -- into accepting that what she knows to
be true is not true.
The writer of Second Peter does not want the church to be gaslighted. He knows that
certain voices are creating doubt. He knows that certain influences are causing believers to
question what they have known to be true. And he wants the church to ignore those voices -- to
hold fast to the reality that God is real, that God is present in the world, that God cares what
happens to us, and -- perhaps most importantly -- that God is coming back, so that where God is,
we might be also. So this author -- whether it is really the apostle Peter or not -- offers the story
that we all know, and the experience that we all share, as a lamp unto our feet and a light unto
our path. This author reminds us all, as the church, that the only way to resist the whispered
voices that it is all a myth, is to reaffirm our trust in the things that we have seen, the things that
we have felt, and the experiences that we have shared as the church.
I now know pretty well what gaslighting is, and I think you do, too. It is a reality in our
world, because there are voices out there denying reality in the name of ideology or selfinterest.
As a people who are called to value the truth, speak the truth and defend the truth, we
are given on this Transfiguration Sunday an ancient word of scripture that lights a lamp in our
darkness in several ways.
First, this scripture reminds us to trust our instincts. For example, it was 80 degrees in
Concord yesterday. It is February. We are an Earth Care congregation, which means that we
believe it is important to pay attention to such things. Do not doubt your heart. Do not doubt
your senses. Do not doubt what you can plainly see and feel. Do not doubt the 97 percent of
scientists who say that we, as a human race, are threatening the health of our planet in the ways
we are living.
5
Secondly, this scripture reminds us to trust what we have experienced in the church
about the reality of Christ's presence in this world. On Friday, a group of elders and leaders from our church gathered for a planning retreat, and were reminded that Christ is not someone
we just carry around in our hearts like luggage. We were reminded that Christ is alive, that
Christ is present here, not in a disembodied theoretical way, but with a real presence and
personality that is seated beside you right now on your pew. Christ is at work in this place right
now, guiding us, encouraging us, leading us and using us. He is not a myth. He is not a fable. And
we know that is true because we have experienced him -- experienced his power and his grace
and his presence… here... together... in this community. I have heard you talk about it with
passion and the deepest gratitude -- families in grief and crisis who have experienced the love
of Christ in the care they have received from this church... men and women who have been
moved and inspired by the Holy Spirit in worship, right here. This scripture reminds us to trust
those experiences, and to hold onto the power of that knowledge, because it will preserve and
protect us against the steady drip of those who say it is all a myth... that God was never really
here… and our savior Jesus is not really coming back.
The reality of life, and the reality of discipleship, is that the light of our faith will
periodically dim and strengthen. Our lamps will ebb and flow, weaken and surge. In the seasons
of life and faith, the firmness of our grip on the truth will fluctuate. But in strong times and in
weak ones, God calls us to remember those things that we have known, not just because they
have been told to us, but because we have felt them and experienced them for ourselves as
truth. We are called to hold fast to these experiences of God's power and presence and glory, for
these things will always light a path for us in the darkness. ""You will do well to be attentive to
this,"" scripture says, ""as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning
star rises in your hearts.""
In the end, Paula regains her strength and confidence for one reason, and one reason
only. A sympathetic person comes alongside her. He arrives at just the right time -- to listen to
her, to believe her, to confirm that the things she is seeing and believing are in fact real. He
helps her to see that the lies that are being told to her really are lies, that the things she has
thought to be true really have been true all along. With his help, Paula learns once more to rely
upon her senses, to cherish her memories, and to have faith in herself.
In the final scene of the movie, when the danger is finally past, and the truth is once
again the truth, Paula looks out into the darkness with this man who has saved and liberated
her from her tormentor. Though her immediate peril is ended, the darkness has not yet
dissipated. ""This night will be a long night,"" she says.
""But it will end,"" the man says. ""It's [already] starting to clear. In the morning, when the
sun rises, sometimes it's hard to believe there ever was a night. You'll find that, too.""
6
Scripture gives us the same assurance. The gaslight may dim and surge, the light may
ebb and flow, but God's presence never fades. God is present here, in power and in truth. The
promise of the gospel is that what you hope to be true, what you have felt to be true, really is
true.
Thanks be to God. Amen.

"In our highly individualized culture, we are likely to hear the claim ""you are God's
temple"" as a call to personal self-improvement. You are God's temple, so you really should quit
smoking. You are God's temple, so cut out the trans fats and eat more whole grains. You are
God's temple, so get off the couch and onto the treadmill.
This is not bad advice, but it is not what Paul is trying to say here. We know that Paul is
not addressing these words to individuals, because all of his pronouns are plural. The you's are
actually y'alls. According to Paul, God's Spirit chooses to dwell not just in the individual soul,
but in the community of the church. According to Paul, being God's temple is not something we
can do by ourselves. According to Paul, only a ""we"" can be God's temple.
For this reason, the metaphor of a construction project is well chosen. When Paul
compares the church to ""God's building,"" Paul knows that building a church, just like building a
house, is a team activity. Proper construction requires skilled contributions from all kinds of
people -- environmental engineers, architects, grading contractors, paving companies, brick
masons, carpenters, roofers, plumbers and electricians. Even when all the necessary players are
involved, plans can still go awry. If everyone isn't careful, if each contributor does not do his or
her job well, the building could end up with corners that are not quite square, walls that are not
quite plumb, wires that do not quite connect, or pipes that do not quite drain.
If quality and attention to detail is important for a normal building, Paul suggests, then it
is even more critical for the construction of God's house. It all begins with the foundation, and
as Paul consistently does, he lays that foundation on the only base strong enough to stand the
test of time. ""No one can lay any foundation other than the one that has been laid,"" Paul
proclaims, ""[and] that foundation is Jesus Christ"" (3:11). That is the foundation upon which
Paul has labored with all the grace and skill that God had given him, and he calls upon each
laborer who would come after him, every person whom God has called or will call into Christ's
church, to do the same. ""Each builder must choose with care how to build on [this foundation],""
Paul warns, for the integrity of the structure relies on each person doing the best that he or she
can do for God and the group.
Near the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, nestled among the rocky and sunbaked
hills of central Israel, sit the ruins of the ancient city of Qumran. It is here that the famous Dead
Sea Scrolls were discovered by a young Bedouin shepherd boy in the 1940s, and it is also
""Y’all Are God’s Temple""

believed to have been the home of an ascetic community of Essenes around the time of Christ.
The settlement was the closest thing that Judaism had to a monastery, which meant that the
people of Qumran took their faith very, very seriously.
Today, all that remains of this once-vibrant community are the foundations. The
buildings themselves are gone, but the footings -- most of which are only a few feet high – still
tell a story of the faithful people who lived there. Walking through the ruins of the library, one
can easily imagine the extensive shelves housing scrolls of nearly every book of the Hebrew
Bible. Inkwells and remnants of writing benches found within those foundations recall the
community's steady emphasis on diligent study and reflection on God's Word. A few steps
farther, the footings of the dining hall mark the room where the whole community ate together
as one family. Over 1,000 vessels -- 708 cups, 210 plates, 108 bowls -- have been found there.
Closer to the sea, one can still descend the steps into a large basin, the place where ritual
cleansings were performed. Holiness was expected of everyone, and rules of purity were
strictly enforced. These were people who shared everything: meals, study, work, worship,
devotion, property, joys and sorrows. Because the entire community was God's building, each
person knew that he or she must labor together to build themselves into the purest, best, most
giving congregation they could be.
This common purpose is obvious in one of the most important documents discovered at
Qumran, which has been aptly named the “Community Rule.” It was a comprehensive code of
conduct for the community, a solemn covenant that the people made with God and each other
that they would be God's temple together. After a catalog of the shared responsibilities of
membership in the group, the rule summarized the purpose of these expectations:
The Congregation should pursue these “ways in the world for the enlightenment
of the heart of man”: “a spirit of humility, patience, abundant charity, unending
goodness, understanding and intelligence, [a spirit of] mighty wisdom which trusts in
all the deeds of God and leans on His great loving-kindness; a spirit of discernment in
every purpose, of zeal for just laws, of holy intent with steadfastness of heart, of great
charity … of admirable purity … of humble conduct … These are the counsels of the spirit
to the sons of truth in this world…
And when these are in Israel, the … Community shall be established in truth. It
shall be an Everlasting Plantation, a House of Holiness… an Assembly of Supreme
Holiness… a Most Holy Dwelling… a House of Perfection and Truth.”1
There is great resonance between the call to purity in Qumran and the call to
faithfulness in Paul's letters. For Paul, faith is never to be a selfish thing, a self-focused thing.
The mind of faith is always set on God and other people. The traits valued in the Community
Rule are the same as the ones valued in Paul's communities: humility, patience, goodness,
understanding, intelligence, trust, steadfastness of heart, great charity, admirable purity and
humble conduct. If our goal is to cooperate with God in the Everlasting Plantation God is
building, the House of Holiness God wants us to be, then Paul says we must be very careful
about what we are building, not just for ourselves, but for the church that will come after us.
As people who are trying to build on the faithful foundation of Christ, to preserve for this
generation and pass on to the next one a church that continues to rest on firm footings, we have
to be careful about our building in two ways. First, we have to be careful not to put too much
faith in ourselves. If we think our contributions are more important than those of others, if we dismiss the value that other people with other types of gifts bring to worship, mission or
ministry, then we are not acting with the humility, charity and trust that Paul is seeking. To
paraphrase the apostle, the moment we think that we are wise, that we have all the answers, we
should get a little nervous about how much spotlight we are grabbing for ourselves. ""You
should become fools,"" Paul says, ""so that you may become wise.""
But we must also guard against the opposite error, and that is not putting enough faith
in ourselves. Pretty much every week, I hear people describe how unqualified they think they
are for ministry. ""I am just not comfortable praying in front of others,"" they say. ""I think Sunday
school is important, but I just don't know enough about the Bible to teach."" ""I know that
stewardship is important, but I am very uncomfortable talking with people about their money.""
I have said it before and I will say it again. God made you the way you are for a reason. God
gave you certain gifts and passions and abilities, and God expects you to use them for good.
When we lived in Wilmington, I made a small stone patio outside of our back door,
something just big enough to hold a small table and a few chairs. I dug out the area, filled it with
sand, and then started to lay the various paving stones in place. They were of many different
colors -- some darker and some lighter -- and they were in all kinds of shapes -- some big and
thick, others smaller and thinner. Because they were irregular, getting them to fit together was
like working a big puzzle. I tried all kinds of configurations. Finally, after much trial and error, I
found a way to fit them all together. In the end, those pieces that seemed the oddest -- the ones
that I wondered how in the world I would ever be able to use -- were the ones that fit perfectly
into the gaps. They were the stones that made the whole project come together. If you have
ever worried that you just don't fit in, if you are struggling to see how God can use your
particular set of gifts in the construction of God's temple, then let me just encourage you to
keep looking, to keep trying to find your place, because God really does have a plan just for you
in this divine project called the church.
The congregation I served in Rocky Mount loves to tell the story of Lib Dove, a Sunday
school teacher who had a great gift for music and a wonderful way with children. She taught in
the 1960's, a time when downtown Rocky Mount was changing along with the rest of America.
The church had outgrown its walls, and something had to be done about the building. One
group in the congregation had wanted to move the church to the outskirts of town, closer to the
neighborhoods where most of the members lived. To the congregation's credit, that effort was
defeated. The vote was close, but the congregation recommitted itself to being a downtown
church, to living out its faith in a neighborhood where the living stones were not all the same
color and not all the same shape. The majority understood that faith can never be a selfish
thing, that the mind of faith is always set on God and other people.
Because the church had decided to stay, plans were quickly drawn for a new addition to
the church. It would house new offices, classrooms, gathering spaces and even a gym. Lib Dove,
being the great Sunday school teacher that she was, wanted to get the children involved.
Putting her best musical skills to work, she wrote a song for the children to sing. The title was
“O We’re Going to Build a Church.” During Bible School that summer, she asked the children to
bring in their pennies and nickels to contribute toward the building campaign. By the end of
the week, they had amassed maybe three or four dollars. And then, on the Friday that ended
Bible school, the children lined up outside of church with the change they had collected. With
their teachers leading the way, they marched in procession down Church Street to the brick
yard at the other end of town, singing their new song all the way… “O We’re Going to Build a
Church!” At the brick yard, each child traded their little bits of change for a single, red brick.
And then they marched right back down to the church, each carrying a building block, once 
again singing all the way… “O We’re Going to Build a Church, brick by brick.” Back at the
church, a mason was now waiting for the procession to return. He stood at a corner of the new
foundation of the addition. Still moving in turn, each child handed his or her brick to the
mason, who carefully spread it with mortar and set it securely in place in the new foundation.
And now the entire church, who had gathered for their return, was now singing in one voice “O
We’re Going to Build a Church, brick by brick, hand by hand.”
""Do you not know,"" Paul says, ""that y'all are God’s temple?"" This thing we are doing --
this community that God is building with us and through us -- is work that cannot be done
unless it is shared. With humility, patience, charity and trust, each of us must choose with care
how we will build upon the foundation laid by Christ. With the innocence and faith of a little
child, may we all bring the gifts that we can bring, and lay our own contribution upon the Christ
the firm foundation, saying together “O We’re Going to Build a Church, brick by brick, hand by
hand.”
Amen.",Peter Bynum,"Concord, NC",2/19/2017,
"During our last year of seminary Chris and I somehow found ourselves in charge of the
recently created community garden. Columbia has this wonderful large field in between the
dorms and family apartments, which for the longest time was used for ultimate Frisbee games,
picnics, dog walks, and other outdoor festivities. Sometime before us a group of students decided
that it would be wise to work together, be good stewards of God’s earth, and create a space on
the field to have different plots that students could tend for a year. The goal was to grow enough
food to share with a homeless church community that was close to the seminary. By the time our
senior year came around, Chris stepped into the lead role for the garden, which apart from caring
for our own plot, duties also included getting everything tilled and ready, divvying out the plots
and making sure the gardening tools didn’t wander too far. I am relieved to tell you that the
garden is still in place and thriving to this day, but I must also be truthful and admit that our year
with the garden almost failed. Chris and I planted all sorts of things from tomatoes to jalapenos,
beans and okra. Never have I been so anxious and excited watching the seedlings sprout and
grow. We were feeling might proud of our green thumbs, and were enjoying the fruits of our
labor with plenty of fresh veggies to eat. And then things spiraled out of control. Tending a
garden, taking classes and preparing for ordination exams proved to be a bit more than any of us
could handle. So weeds and vines took over, veggies ripened and then rotted, things grew too
high and blocked the sun for others, plots merged into one another and our carefully planned and
planted garden took on a life of its own. Were it not for a friend who had been apparently
sneakily clipping and eating our wily sugar snap peas, I would say we failed. At least, if
anything, we fed somebody.
Maybe, just maybe, by Paul’s standards, we were a success. If the Apostle Paul had been
in charge of the Columbia Seminary Community Garden, I can imagine that he would say that
our carefully planned and divided plots took away from our shared vision and purpose. Paul

would also nudge us back to the spiritual aspect of what we were supposed to be doing. Sure we
weren’t arguing or fighting, but we certainly weren’t working together. In today’s reading, Paul
is writing to the people of Corinth to correct and instruct and essentially calls them babies. Paul
tells them that like infants, they are spiritually immature, not ready for solid food. Trust Paul to
bring some theological and metaphorical sass. Despite all of what they have been taught, they
continue to lose sight of what they are called to with all their distractions of jealousy and
fighting. In their community of faith they have lost sight of their purpose. They have drawn a
dividing line, chosen camps, putting more faith in the leaders Apollos or Paul than in God. Their
identity has become bound to the spiritual leaders they feel they belong to, rather than finding
their identity and belonging in God. Paul’s anger is not at their pettiness or even their
disagreements, but what is at the heart of those divisions. It is their spiritual arrogance that has
revealed itself in the form of dominance that leads him to write such words.1 But even then, Paul
recognizes that their behavior is purely human.
And I think Paul might find us to be pretty human as well these days. When reading this
scripture it is not too hard to take out Apollos and Paul and insert the names and things we
belong to that have the potential to divide us. I belong to this denomination or that denomination
or I belong to this Sunday School class or that one. Or to take it outside these walls; I belong to
the Democrats or the Republicans, this team or that team, the NRA or the ACLU, the Boy Scouts
or the Girls Scouts, Young Life or AARP, the Rotary Club or the American Legion. Our lives are
constantly divided into plots of viewpoints and world outlooks. It is human to search for the
places where we belong, to set up camp and settle in. It is human to seek comfort with the people
who think and act like us. It is human to align with the things and people we love and to set
ourselves apart from things we don’t like and disagree with.
But Paul would remind us that we care called to something more and we have been
created for something more. It is the very reason that Paul called the Corinthians out on their
human-ness, repeating and emphasizing that that sort of behavior is of the flesh. And to simply
be of the flesh means a disregard for the Spirit. The Spirit who gifts us different gifts and ideas,
but who also calls us to unity. And this is where we have to be careful, especially as a church. In
todays world it is easy to say we will just agree to disagree, or to avoid the hard conversations
because we know there is no budging going to happen, or to leave things shallow and superficial
because it is just too exhausting to go deeper. Or maybe its easy to avoid things long enough all
together that we stop showing up, or we just pack up our ball and go home. And friends,
sometimes that scares me. And out of this fear, I have confessions to make. I have pruned my
Facebook trying to tame the wild garden of lobbed arguments and hurled insults. I have grown
numb to presbytery meetings where we vote on churches leaving the denomination and I no
longer think twice about my vote. I have talked about weather more with family and friends
because it is easier than talking about the growing distances between us because of ideologies
and theology.
So I confess that I have been lulled into a false sense of unity. And I hear Paul’s words
ring loud and clear for me. And maybe you do too. Because all of this carefully crafted safe
space I am making, avoiding hard conversations and differences as if they are landmines, sure
feels easier than charging into the fray, but boy is it exhausting. I am worn out on this kind of  unity. And this is what Paul warns us about. To say we are reaching out when we are standing
safely on our side of the fence isn’t connection. To say we are together when we are standing in
our own separate boxes isn’t community. And yet, Paul wouldn’t say that you should give up or
turn on what you believe in for the sake of unity. There is such a tension to hold here and the
danger here is that we might hear Paul’s words as a call to better manners or mere instruction for
getting along and playing nice.
But Paul’s words are meant to be a wake-up call, just like they were for the people of
Corinth. Community is at stake and the deep division is deadly to the faith and the detrimental
for the health of the body of Christ.2 When we get so set apart by our beliefs and other various
things we belong to, we begin to lose sight of our identity in Christ and our common purpose and
calling. For the Corinthians, it wasn’t wrong to follow Paul or Apollos, for they were both
servants through whom the Corinthians came to believe in God, but they when they divided
themselves into the two different camps, when they began to argue who was right and who was
wrong, they lost track of their belonging to God. Even the most well-meaning groups can distract
from who we are called and created to be. As Paul says, I planted, Apollos watered, but God
gave the growth. Planting and watering are important, but growth doesn’t happen unless the two
happen together. For we are God’s servants, working together. We are God’s field.
So, field, how do we do this? How do we work for this unity when there is so much that
divides us? How do we remember our identity and belonging in Christ when our sense of
belonging, our ideologies and allegiances are scattered in so many different places? How do we
create a fertile field for God’s growth when we have stamped our feet and packed in the dirt of
our safe foxholes where we are right? There are no easy answers here, no magic formulas, no
divine roto-tillers. But I can offer you the words of Yehuda Amichai, a poet from Israel, and his
poem titled “The Place Where We Are Right”
From the place where we are right
Flowers will never grow
In the spring.
The place where we are right
Is hard and trampled
Like a yard.
But doubts and loves
Dig up the world
Like a mole, a plow.
And a whisper will be heard in the place
Where the ruined
House once stood.3
Amichai suggests that things might just change for the better and we could begin to grow if we
spoke not from our certainties but from our doubts and loves. It is not about so earnestly
speaking from where we are right and where others are wrong, no we won’t get too far there. We will just continue to hard pack the earth, drawing dividing lines where nothing good can grow.
To speak about our doubts and loves has echoes of what we do together in worship, where we
are the body of Christ together. It is no mistake that our first move in worship after praise in our
call to worship is to ask for forgiveness. To name and let go of the things that separate us from
God and from one another. Our belonging is rooted in being part of a community that considers
the forgiveness of sins as the way in, and being met with God’s grace and then sharing that grace
with one another. That is why we are here, that is why we need each other.
Two weeks ago I was in Denver at the Annual Conference for Presbyterian Church
Educators. Hundreds of ministers, teachers, church folk alike gathered to shared ideas about how
to better and creatively teach the faith to people of all ages. And we gathered around the theme
“God With Us in the Chaos.” In worship and plenaries we named some of the hard realities that
we are facing, whether in the church or in the world. We talked about the tense climate in which
we find ourselves, our polarized living that seems to show the common middle ground shrinking
as we get pulled to two different ends of the spectrum. Writer, theologian and Lutheran Minister
Nadia Bolz-Weber preached and spoke on just why she is staying in the church, even when has
become such a hard place that struggles to be unified and often fails. She gave us three reasons,
just three, though I am sure there are hundreds more, but they helped us all to take a deep breath
and find hope. Number 1: I need the church and the Gospel in order to see myself differently.
She named that the ugly, twisted thing in her, that she calls sin, needs the church so it can keep
her from turning in on herself and away from God and neighbor. Number 2: I need the church
because I need to see the world differently. The church opens her eyes to a different way to live
or as she said, “In the same way that hurt people hurt people, forgiven people forgive people, and
loved people love people, and grateful people are more generous.”4 Number 3: I need the church
because I need to see others differently. It all came down to salvation for her. Her salvation is all
wrapped up in the salvation of others and as she put it, “I need mercy and forgiveness so much
more than I need self-righteousness.”5
Friends we need each other, and we need the church. And we are the church. This is
where we find our belonging. We are one in our calling in our relationship to Christ. And this
belonging, as Paul reminds us, affects who we are going to be among one another and how we
are going to be. The Spirit calls us to a greater unity and common purpose. Our belonging to God
must be more than to our human leaders or traditions, ideologies, moral attitudes or affinity
groups. There are many things we subscribe to but there is one thing we belong to. For we are
God’s servants, working together, God’s field, you and me, brother and sister, neighbor and
stranger, even with all of our differences, all of our gifts and varied roles and God is working
alongside of us. Thanks be to God for the courage and grace. Amen.",Rachel Vogado,"Concord, NC",2/12/2017,
"When it comes right down to it, the act of fasting is a rejection of the normal order of
things. According to the laws of nature, human beings must eat to survive. The rhythms of our
lives largely revolve around meals, and when we fast we disrupt those rhythms. The hope is
that such a disruption will open us to an awareness of an even deeper necessity -- a need that is
more easily lost in the din of everyday living. Fasting is a way to cut through the normalcy of
life and remind us that we need God.1
In the traditions of Jewish faith, fasting operates in two basic ways. The first is to
cleanse and restore a relationship that has been tarnished by sin. When King David finally
confronts his sinful relationship with Bathsheba, he begins his repentance with a fast (2 Samuel
12). Jewish brides and grooms fast on their wedding day to atone for their sins and purify
themselves before they take their vows. If the Torah is ever dropped and hits the ground, the
entire congregation fasts as an act of penance. On Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, all
members of the community fast in order to deny themselves, ""afflict"" their souls, and ask for
forgiveness for their misdeeds and moral failures. A fast recognizes sinfulness, inflicts a form of
self-denial, and seeks to appease God and turn God away from the punishments that we justly There is, however, a second side of fasting. The ancient discipline did not just look back
upon bad acts with regret. It also looked ahead to future duties and responsibilities. This was
the fast of the prophets, the one which viewed self-denial as a way to awaken and energize the
proper ethics and behavior of God's people. This kind of fasting is another kind of disruption,
another way to reject the normal order of things. It recognizes that proper worship is not just
about getting our souls right with God. It is about orienting ourselves to do right by God in our
daily living.
In this morning's passage, we hear that the Hebrews were fasting just like scripture said
they should. They fasted on all the right holidays. They fasted for the right amount of time. But
something was off. For some reason, fasting was not connecting them to God the way they
thought it should. In fact, God did not seem to be responding to their fasting at all. Their fast
was supposed to help them find God, but they could not see him, could not sense him, could not
find him anywhere. “Why do we fast, but you do not see?"" they asked. ""Why are we humbling
ourselves when you do not notice?”
According to Isaiah, this was happening because the people were making two critical
errors in their fasting. The first was they thought that fasting was all they really needed to do.
They were going through the motions of what fasting required, but beyond that, they just went
about their day as usual. The way scripture says it is that on their fast days they ""served their
own interest,"" but a better translation might be that on fast days ""it was business as usual.""3
When I was first learning to drive a car, I did what many teens do. I assumed it was
mostly about mastering the physical motions. I figured out which pedal was the gas and which
was the brake. I learned how to put the car in drive and reverse. I found the lever that turned
on the windshield wipers and the one that controlled the turn signal. I got all that down pat
and I figured I was good to go. The day after I got my license I was driving some friends
somewhere in my mom's station wagon. I can't remember where we are going, but I remember
the exact intersection where we were -- Cornwallis and Kirkpatrick in Greensboro. I needed to
turn left, and I tried to zip between two oncoming cars. I overestimated the distance between
those two cars by a lot, so when I turned -- let's just say that everyone in the car voiced some
concern the choice I had made. We made it unscathed, but not by much. As a new driver, I
hadn't really thought about all the things that were involved with safe, responsible driving. I
hadn't appreciated that there was an art to watching for potential hazards, maintaining a safe
following distance, slowing down around curves, or making left turns on two-way roads. I
hadn't realized that driving required constant interpretation and re-interpretation of your
surroundings. At the time, I was much more interested in the normal business of being a
teenager: talking to friends; working the radio; and trying to look as cool as possible at every
possible moment. As I squeaked through that harrowing left turn, I realized there was more to
this driving thing than I had really appreciated before.
So, the first error the Israelites made was to focus on fasting to the exclusion of
everything else. They lost sight of the fact that fasting was not an end in itself. It was meant to
create space and focus for other disciplines -- prayer, scripture reading, confession and selfreflection.
It was meant to be a doorway not to hunger but to spiritual transformation. It
would be like us thinking that all we needed to do in the life of faith was show up to church on
Sunday morning. If all we did was come here on the Lord's Day to sit in the pew, just to use that
hour thinking of all the things we needed to get done that week, then we would be missing the
entire point. Eventually, we would begin to wonder why that practice was leaving us so empty. It was the second mistake the Israelites made, however, that really got God's attention.
In all those other things they were doing and thinking about, the people had forgotten the
needs of others. Fasting was not reminding them of their obligations to help the orphan, the
widow and the stranger. In fact, they were actually using their fasting time to abuse and take
advantage of other people. They were oppressing their workers, quarrelling, fighting, striking
with wicked fists. They were certainly not doing the things that God wanted them to do. Sure
they were lying around in sackcloth and ashes, going through the motions of obedience
humility, but God knew that nothing else in their lives really showed either obedience or
humility.
""I don't care a lick about the sackcloth and ashes,"" God says. ""What I really want from
you is to 'to loose the bonds of injustice... to let the oppressed go free... to share your bread with
the hungry... [to] bring the homeless poor into your house... to clothe the naked and bind up the
brokenhearted... to care for people who need help, whoever they may be and wherever they
may be."" The people are fasting, but they are still thinking only about themselves, and that is
not the kind of fast that God wants from us.
In the end, an act of worship -- be it fasting, praying, singing, studying or serving -- is
about God. It is about offering to God what we owe to God. But it is also about us. It is
something that is supposed to change us, mold us, and transform us into something that is
closer to God's image. Isaiah reminds us that, with every spiritual discipline, there is a good
way to know whether it is working. If the act does not draw us closer to others -- if it does not
create in us a heart that wants to serve, wants to help, and wants to honor others, then we are
not doing it right. Our God wants good things for us. God wants to draw each of us closer in
purity and goodness. But God is also concerned about the world beyond us. When people are
hungry, God is concerned. When people don't have medicine, God is concerned. When people
are stuck in dangerous situations, God is concerned. And God wants us to be concerned as well.
""Fasting is all well and good,"" God says. ""But this is what I really want: open your heart
to people who need your help. If you can do that, when you do that, then your light shall break
forth like the dawn, and you will never again have any trouble finding me.""
Thanks be to God. Amen.",Peter Bynum,"Concord, NC",2/5/2017,
"This reading serves as the introduction to the most famous sermon ever given. With
these words, Jesus establishes himself as the new Moses, the giver of a new law that will forever
define the relationship between God and humanity. When it comes to how Jesus says that we
should live, what we should want and how we should act, the words of this sermon easily
number among the most important in the Bible.
At some point, most of us here have probably heard that old Toastmasters adage about
speaking and writing. Many call it the ""Aristotelian triptych"" -- the idea that, if you want to
make a persuasive presentation, you should do three things: tell 'em what you're going to tell
'em; tell 'em; and then tell 'em what you told them.""
In reality, Aristotle's advice on rhetoric goes much deeper than that. In 350 B.C., he
argued that a persuasive speech must attend to three basic elements. First is the ethos. Right
off the bat, the orator must establish the character and integrity of both of the speaker and the
topic. He or she must set the stage for what is to come and distinguish it as significant enough
that people will want to listen. Only then could the speaker move to the logos, the substance of
what needed to be said (which, in this case, would be the new law that Jesus wanted to convey).
Finally, an effective speech must include an element of pathos. The audience had to move
beyond thinking about a topic to feeling it with emotion and passion.
1
So, in these first words, Jesus is not just ""telling 'em what he is going to tell 'em"" in the
Sermon on the Mount. He is establishing an ethos for everything he is about to say. He is
defining the core beliefs, character and morality of the kingdom of God.2
 In the Beatitudes,
Jesus is creating an entirely new ""ethos of blessedness.""
The first step in creating that new ethos is to redefine the term ""blessedness."" The
Greek word Jesus uses is makários, and it can be translated as blessed, fortunate or happy. In its
most literal form it means to ""extend"" or ""make large.""3
 That is clearly the sense that we get from the
Old Testament book of Deuteronomy, which suggests that those who are faithful to God and obey the law will be blessed with expansion of health, wealth and power. We read this passage just this past
Wednesday in our weekly Bible study:
""If you will only obey the LORD your God, by diligently observing all his commandments that
I am commanding you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of
the earth; 2all these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you...
4Blessed shall be the
fruit of your womb, the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your livestock, both the increase
of your cattle and the issue of your flock. ...
12The LORD will open for you his rich storehouse,
the heavens, to give the rain of your land in its season and to bless all your undertakings.
You will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow. 13The LORD will make you the head,
and not the tail; you shall be only at the top, and not at the bottom...""
4

Today, we call it the ""Prosperity Gospel"" -- the idea that faith, when we do it right, makes us rich
in not only spiritual but also worldly ways. If we are living a pure life, so the theory goes, our
inner blessing will be matched by an outer one.
So, the first thing Jesus does in creating a new ethos of blessedness is to change the idea
of what it means to be blessed. Yes, Jesus is still describing a reality of good fortune, blessings
and happiness. But that reality is no longer tethered to material goods, wealth or worldly
power. Maybe that will happen. Maybe it won’t. But under the reign of Christ, blessedness is
an inner reality -- a reality of character, morality and ethics. As far as Jesus is concerned,
external, worldly wealth has nothing to do with it.
Unfortunately, the Prosperity Gospel is still alive and well in our culture. In the 1950s,
the great American theologian Reinhold Niebuhr dismissed it altogether as a false gospel. He
called it a cult of ""egocentricity” which ""puts ‘self’ instead of the cross at the center of the
picture.”5
 Even so, the Prosperity Gospel is still propounded with great volume and vigor on
the airwaves by televangelists like Joel Osteen and Mark Burns. Paula White, who just gave the
inaugural prayer on the Capitol steps, is a huge proponent of the Prosperity Gospel. But make
no mistake: even as the world lines up behind a heresy that says faith and wealth are the same
thing, that idea has no place in the ethos of blessedness that Jesus preached.
If that is hard for us to swallow, we need only review the nine marks of blessedness that
Jesus identifies in his introduction to the Sermon on the Mount, because each and every one of
them is diametrically opposed to a theology of prosperity. Blessed are the poor in spirit.
Blessed are those who mourn; those who are meek; those who hunger and thirst; those who are
merciful; those who are persecuted; those who work for peace. None of these speak to wealth
or worldly power. In fact, they speak to the opposite of them.
This brings us to the second major step that Jesus takes in changing the ethos of
blessedness. To Jesus, blessedness is not about worldly strength. It is about surrendering. It is
about obedience. It is about letting go of our own desires, our own goals, our own comforts,
and our own definitions of success.
To illustrate this shift, let's take a closer look at the third beatitude. “Blessed are the
meek,"" Jesus says, ""for they will inherit the earth."" The Prosperity Gospel laughs in the face of
such a claim. ""Who wants to be meek?"" it would say. Meekness is weak and wishy-washy. It is
far better to be bold, perhaps even brash -- better to be respected, perhaps even feared.
Something like meekness could never inherit the earth. If you want to inherit the earth, you
have to go out and grab it. ""Name it and claim it,"" the Prosperity Gospel would say. But Jesus turns this worldly ethos on its ear. The path to true blessedness, he says, requires surrender
and obedience.
Interestingly enough, the Greek word for ""meek"" is the same adjective that is used to
describe an animal that has been broken and tamed.6
 There is a training facility out West that
works with wild stallions. As they are broken in, the horses are taught to obey their trainer in
all things and to trust her completely. They are taught -- every day, countless times a day -- that
when she blows the whistle they must stop immediately and return to their master, no matter
what the circumstances may be. As a final test, the horses are taken to a corral on a desert
hillside. At the bottom of the hill is a crystal clear reservoir, full of cool water fed from a
mountain stream. The horses are left in the corral during the heat of the day for several hours.
When the trainer comes to get them, they are hot and thirsty. All they want is a cool drink of
water from that reservoir. When the trainer finally opens the gate, the horses pour out and
head en masse directly for the water. But just as they are about to get there, the trainer blows
her whistle. Any horse who disobeys and continues toward the water is deemed unready and
must undergo more training. Only those who resist their desperate thirst and return to the
master are deemed ready to serve.7

Dr. John Redhead, longtime pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Greensboro, writes
that this kind of humble obedience is the ""essence of meekness."" ""It is letting go your own way
and letting God have his way,"" he writes. ""It is taking life out of your own hands and putting it
into God's hands, and saying to him, 'O God, do with me and make of me what thou wilt.'""8
Even so, we might ask, how could this kind of meekness ever inherit the earth? Here we
encounter the final, brilliant and earth-shifting move that Jesus makes in his ethos of
blessedness. The irony is that, while this kind of meekness may look like weakness, it is
actually strength. Moses was, by all accounts, the strongest figure of the Old Testament. He was
a man of action who confronted a superpower and led his people to freedom and a land of
promise. And yet scripture says that he was a very meek man, ""more humble than anyone else
on the face of the earth.""9
Meekness is an act of the will that places the purposes of God higher than our own
purposes. It says that what God wants is greater than what we want. If you think about it, a
person who is willing to disregard personal desires in the service of God's desires can be a very
potent, even dangerous person. Such a person cannot be swayed by pain or pleasure. Such a
person can doggedly pursue what is right, whatever may come.
As Redhead writes,
""It is Moses the meek standing before Pharaoh the king and saying 'Let my people go.' It is
Jesus before Pilate, saying with his silence 'Stop me if you can.' It is Peter and John, laughing
in the face of the Jerusalem police, saying 'We must obey God rather than man.' It is Martin
Luther, defying the pope and saying to his princes 'Here I stand.' It is [Martin Luther King,
Jr.] standing up to the power structure of his day and saying 'We shall overcome.' It is John
Knox in Scotland pounding his pulpit in St. Giles, and putting Mary Stuart the queen in her
place. It is any [person], every [person] who so fears the face of God that he [or she] is not
afraid of human flesh."" Within the ethos of blessedness, to be meek is not to be weak. It is to be strong. It is to be
impregnable. It is to be a potent and dangerous force for good.
With the beatitudes, Jesus introduces the Sermon on the Mount, telling the people what
he is about to describe to them. But more importantly, he creates a new ethos, a new
understanding of what faith in God is supposed to be. In essence he says that, if we do not
understand these initial principles, we will not understand anything that he is about to say, or
more importantly, anything that he is about to do.
If we are still hung up on equating happiness with wealth and power, we will not
understand why we don't have to worry about what we will eat or drink or wear, because God
will give us what we need.
If we do not accept that faith is about surrender, that following Jesus is about losing our
lives to gain his, then we will never understand why we should pray for our enemies, put down
our weapons, turn the other cheek and welcome the stranger in love.
If we still believe that meekness, mercy, poverty, hunger and thirst are signs of
weakness, then we will never be able to see the strength and power of a Savior who submitted
to the pain and shame of the cross.
The ethos of blessedness is this:
Forget everything you think you know about happiness.
Forget everything you think you know about winning.
Forget everything you think you know about getting ahead in this life.
“I am about to tell you about a blessed life,” Jesus says. “But if you can't accept these
initial ideas -- if you cannot accept the basics of this new ethos -- then you will never really
understand anything that comes next.”
May God give us the ability to embrace this ethos, so that we may understand what it is
to be truly blessed. Amen.
",Peter Bynum,"Concord, NC",1/29/2017,
"According to the grapevine in Corinth, there were quarrels. Chloe's people were
reliable. They were smart, they were observant, and they told the truth. And they had reported
back to Paul that there were divisions in the church. They were not united in the same mind or
the same purpose, and those divisions were evident in ways that people were finding and
describing their identities. The names of certain leaders had become shorthand for knowing a
person. If someone ""belonged"" to Apollos, for example, it meant that they ascribed to a certain
set of values, policies, gripes and hopes represented by Apollos. If you ""belonged"" to Paul, it
showed your adherence to a different set of values, policies, gripes and hopes. And so the
various names drew lines of distinction within the culture of the church.
According to the grapevine in Concord, there are quarrels here, too. We have just
celebrated or endured, depending on your point of view, a few days that have revealed just how
deep our cultural divisions and disagreements are. Over the past year, some of you have said
proudly ""I'm with Trump,"" while others just as passionately said ""I'm with Her."" Many are
already looking to other leaders in whom we might vest our hopes and find our identities.
Wherever we fall on this spectrum, there is a common denominator that we all share,
and it is our deeply ingrained need to express ourselves. We want to clarify -- to the world and
to ourselves -- who we really are. And, throughout human history, we have tended to express
our identities by reference to the human leaders we follow. When we say we ""belong"" to a
particular leader, that person’s name becomes a potent symbol -- a simple and concise way to
express to the world who we are and what we are about.
However, this tendency to identify with leaders is about more than self-expression. It
also touches an even deeper need that we all share. The word ""belongingness"" almost sounds
like I just made it up (kind of like Stephen Colbert did when he coined the expression
""truthiness"" back in 2005), but belongingness is an actual word that describes an actual
phenomenon. It first emerged in 1995, when psychologists Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary
suggested that human beings have an innate and nearly universal need to belong. The
“belongingness hypothesis” holds that we all ""have a basic psychological need to feel closely
connected to others"" and to contribute to an endeavor that is greater than ourselves.1
In other words, we all have a longing to be part of a group of people that is doing something important,
and we want to feel that our own role within that group is itself relevant and important. Those
who belonged to Apollos, for example, not only shared a certain set of values, but also felt like
they belonged to a mission that was ultimately good, worthy, and significant. They believed
that what Apollos was doing mattered, that their connection to Apollos’ people mattered, and
that their individual contributions within that group also mattered. At the root of
belongingness is the implicit satisfaction of being loved and appreciated for the gifts that one
brings to a larger mission.
2
 Over the past few days, we have seen this kind of belongingness
play out in Washington D.C. and other cities in the various groups that gathered and found
identity, meaning and purpose in the groups to which they proudly belong.
For the record, Paul never says that belongingness is wrong. On the contrary, he seems
to presume that our need to belong to someone or something greater than ourselves is natural,
valid and important. The problem, in Paul's mind, is that the Corinthians had aimed way too
low. It's not that the people they had chosen as leaders were bad. In the book of Acts, we are
told that Apollos was a Christian from Alexandria who was both ""eloquent"" and ""well-versed in
the scriptures.""
3 Cephas was another name for the apostle Peter, and Paul lists himself as
another one of the missionary leaders that had acquired a devoted following. These were all
valid choices for leaders. What Paul was concerned about was that the belongingness people
had created around these leaders had been corrupted into something unhealthy. It had
degenerated into something more akin to tribalism.
Last June, during the contentious debates over Britain's exit from the European Union, Jo
Cox, a Member of Parliament from the Labor Party, was brutally murdered on the street in her
hometown. As her assailant shot and stabbed her multiple times, he was heard to shout
repeatedly, “Put Britain first!” Michael Jinkins, the current president of the Presbyterian
seminary in Louisville, says that deplorable actions like these are the product of what he
describes as ""a tribal spirit which threatens to split the human family into ever smaller units, to
drive wedges between us in the name of nations, politics and religions, to erect impregnable
walls so that the 'we' on one side need never be sullied by the 'them' on the other.""
4This angry brand of tribalism, Jinkins argues, is violent, demonic, and has no place in the Christian faith.
In Corinth, Paul had observed the beginnings of these dangerous trends. Factions were
growing. Fractures were deepening. Negative passions were intensifying. In their affiliations
and beliefs, people had begun to move beyond healthy belongingness into more divisive kinds
of affiliation. And as they did so, they were drifting farther and farther away from the kind of
spiritual and emotional belongingness that God created us to enjoy.
Like all the rest of us, Anne Bechard wanted to belong. First, she wanted to belong in her
convent, where her family sent her as a fourteen year-old girl. To use her words, she wanted to
be accepted. She longed to feel at home. She hoped ""for that reassuring up-nod from the
universe that says, 'You’re one of us. And you get to stay.'”5
 Unfortunately, it was not to be. She found that she just was not cut out for life as a nun. At first, it seemed like a failure, but she felt
like she had no other choice but to leave.
""I know what it’s like to ache for belonging,"" Anne says. ""After six years in a convent as a
teenager, I decided it was time to try life on my own."" But coming home to Memphis didn't
seem to solve the problem. ""I didn’t feel like I was “home” at all,"" she says. ""I was a complete
stranger. Nothing seemed to fit.""
As she continued to struggle to find that illusive ideal of ""belongingness,"" Anne Bechard
made all kinds of mistakes. In all of them, she later realized, her problem was that she had just
aimed way too low. Not wanting to alienate potential friends, she had hidden her past,
including those things that made her who she really was. In her attempts to fit in, she had
pursued the hopes and dreams that she thought others wanted for her, instead of the dreams
she dreamed for herself. In her hopes to belong, she had sought out the in-crowd and the cool
people, but she had quickly realized that those people had never really accepted her for who
she really was. In the places where she was looking for identity, she had been aiming too low.
In the heroes and role models she had chosen for herself, she had been aiming too low. In the
groups of friends she sought to join, she had been aiming too low.
I think we do the same thing. In the ways we seek identity, we are aiming much too low.
In our role models, we are aiming much too low. In the ways that we seek to belong, we are
aiming much too low. In this letter that still speaks to us today, Paul urges us to set our sights
higher in all of these ways. Our true belongingness, he says, is only found in the cross of Christ.
The world says the cross is foolishness, but faith says it is wisdom. The world says the cross is
weakness, but faith says it is power. While the world chases human ideas, taunts human
success, and boasts in human power, the factions that divide us only deepen and intensify. By
contrast, Paul urges us to look higher -- to rise up and find ourselves in a Christ who heals,
energizes and unifies. That is where our true identity is. That is the only place where we
always fit in. That is the only place where we are always OK. That is where we truly belong.
As we seek this enduring kind of belongingness, we have to be vigilant in identifying
negative tribalism in our own country, in our own community, in our own church and in our
own selves. We have to rise above the easy path of identifying ourselves with reference to
human leaders, human parties, human businesses and enterprises. In short, we are called to
seek our belongingness in Christ -- and only in Christ -- because this kind of affiliation (unlike
the human hash-tags that we so quickly adopt) is the only place where we truly do belong. We
will never truly belong, and we will never truly know ourselves, until we rise higher and see
ourselves through the eyes of Christ -- as people who truly ""belong to Christ.""
Anne Bechard went from a Christian convent, to cultural compromise, to confessional
confusion, and ultimately to confidence and confirmation in Christ. So, I will give her the final
word:
""Want to know the truth about belonging? It takes courage to belong. It takes bravery to
show up in your own skin. It’s easy to fit in. It’s easy to blend in and hide your
outrageousness. And it’s also the easiest way to lose the precious parts of you. You deserve
to be seen. You deserve to be heard. You deserve to be known for the real deal that you
are. Stop taking the easy way out. Stop trying to fit in. The best place in life is where you’re
already okay. Come home to you. It’s where you belong.""
Thanks be to God. Amen.",Peter Bynum,"Concord, NC",1/22/2017,
"I love to write, which is a fortunate thing because we do a lot of writing as pastors. I haven’t always
felt that way, but somewhere in my journey through seminary, I learned that I could reflect and
connect when putting pen to paper in ways that couldn’t quite happen in my head. There was
something about capturing all the undefined emotions and observations of my insides and then using
this vast array of words to try to process, organize and express whatever was swirling around my head
and my heart.
Because I enjoy this process so much, one would think that I have a blog and that I fill up journal after
journal. Not so much. It’s not that I don’t love a good journal. I’m a sucker for those artsy, pretty
journals with organic paper that you find at those boutique paper shops or journals that have been
handcrafted out of leather like you see at arts and crafts festivals. I probably own something like 20
journals, and yet I have written on the first 2-3 pages of all of them and then I set them aside. I always
feel so great after the process of journaling that I promise myself that I will definitely make it a daily
discipline. It hasn’t happened yet. And if someone 100 years into the future were to locate these
journals and piece together their entries, they would think I have lived a complete disaster of a life.
Because I only sit down and write in them when things are really, really bad.
On the flipside, there’s Facebook. I don’t post a whole lot on Facebook, but if one were to look at my
life through the eyes of Facebook, it looks like I live a perfect and charmed existence. In Facebook
world, the snow is beautiful, the vacations fabulous, the sunsets ethereal. In journal world, I wiped
out on the ice, the kids fought the entire trip and it rains constantly. Of course both accounts are
simultaneously misleading and absolutely true. Life contains both the pit of despair and the
mountaintop high, but we seldom hold those two in tension so close together or utter them in the same
breath.
That is why I have fallen in love with our Psalm for this morning, Psalm 40. Our common lectionary
only recommended reading verses 1-11, but I opted to preach on the whole Psalm because it offers the
whole life experience together, framed in the language that we, as people of faith, are invited to use. I
invite you to read or listen to the reading of this Psalm, paying close attention to the movement as it
opens with a hint of lament, moves to praise and thanksgiving and culminates back into lament and
petitions. Read and listen for God’s word to you today:
1
I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me and heard my cry.
2He drew me up from the desolate pit, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my
steps secure.
3He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their
trust in the Lord.
4Happy are those who make the Lord their trust, who do not turn to the proud, to those who go astray
after false gods.
“Find your Jam”
Rev. Lynne Keel
1-15-17
2
5You have multiplied, O Lord my God, your wondrous deeds and your thoughts toward us; none can
compare with you. Were I to proclaim and tell of them, they would be more than can be counted.
6
Sacrifice and offering you do not desire, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin
offering you have not required.
7Then I said, “Here I am; in the scroll of the book it is written of me.
8
I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart.”
9
I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; see, I have not restrained my lips,
as you know, O Lord.
10I have not hidden your saving help within my heart, I have spoken of your faithfulness and your
salvation; I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation.
11Do not, O Lord, withhold your mercy from me; let your steadfast love and your faithfulness keep me
safe forever.
12For evils have encompassed me without number; my iniquities have overtaken me, until I cannot
see; they are more than the hairs of my head, and my heart fails me.
13Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me; O Lord, make haste to help me.
14Let all those be put to shame and confusion who seek to snatch away my life; let those be turned
back and brought to dishonor who desire my hurt.
15Let those be appalled because of their shame who say to me, “Aha, Aha!”
16But may all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; may those who love your salvation say
continually, “Great is the Lord!”
17As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my
deliverer; do not delay, O my God.
This is the word of the Lord, thanks be to God.
Isn’t that a lovely psalm? It is fast moving up to my top 5 favorite psalms, because it is so instructive
and comprehensive. It invites us to bear witness about what is happening in our lives and put it into
dialogue with our faith. I’ll be honest, though, this psalm writer almost lost me when it opened with
“I waited patiently for the Lord.” Well good for you, psalmist. Patience is not my gift, and so at the
top I was thinking this Psalm might be a bit beyond my pay grade. As I have aged, I think I’ve gotten
better at patience which is to say that I now have the patience of a 10 year old rather than a 2 year old.
But I still have a way to go. Anyone who has fervently prayed a prayer of desperation knows
something about the unbearable waiting. Very rarely do we ever get an answered prayer on the spot.
Some deeper digging into this text revealed to me that a more literal translation of the Hebrew is
something like “Waited, I waited or Waiting, I waited,” emphasis on waiting with nothing about
actual patience. This made me feel much better. Waiting on God is something I think we can all
relate to and thankfully patience doesn’t seem to be a prerequisite for us to be faithful in the waiting.
Rather than dwelling on the waiting, the psalmist seems content to move immediately to praise of
God’s deliverance. Verse 2: “He drew me up from the desolate pit, out of the miry bog, and set my
feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.” And then in Verse 5: “You have multiplied your wondrous
deeds and your thoughts toward us…were I to proclaim and tell of them, they would be more than can
be counted.” While the psalmist lacked computers to count all these deeds and collect them as
verifiable data, the author is making a powerful statement about the sheer magnitude of the ways God
has worked and moved in his or her life. This feels like one of the most important parts of the psalm
to me.
By most accounts, 2016 was a brutal year for so many reasons. So many cancer diagnoses, deaths,
broken relationships, ugly statements and behavior. It was a toxic year for so many people that I encountered, including myself. What worries me about this constant stream of negativity is that we
have gotten really good at complaining and lamenting and have gotten out of the practice of praising.
Having been in conversation with people in the service industry or helping professions, they have told
me that very few people give compliments for good service anymore but will angrily and aggressively
make a long list of complaints when something wasn’t satisfactory.
I’m no stranger to receiving or making complaints myself as exhibited in my journaling habits, so I
wonder where we could all learn something from the psalmist. Perhaps we could do a better job of
taking note of the many gifts and blessings in our lives and offering praise and thanks to God for those
gifts. As we open our mouths or pick up our pens to make a complaint, how might we pause to
reframe the moment and think about how God has delivered us from the many pitfalls of our lives?
I’ve been a little obsessed lately with the soundtrack of the Broadway musical “Hamilton,” and there’s
a refrain that Eliza Hamilton sings: “Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right
now.” She sings this in the midst of the American Revolution which we can look back upon and see
through rose colored glasses, but I’m sure things felt pretty negative and dark for our Founding
Fathers while preparing for war. Yet, she was able to focus on the possibilities and blessings rather
than the hardships.
The truth is, here in 2017, we are so fortunate in almost embarrassing ways. We have access to
resources and possibilities unlike any previous generation. There are gadgets and machines that do
things that I never could have dreamed of as a kid. And we’ve had access to things like public
education, law enforcement, and healthcare for so long that we completely take it for granted. This
was especially apparent to me coming back from Haiti where mothers carried cinder blocks on their
heads on a two hour hike just so their kids could have a shelter for school. Haitians feel no sense of
entitlement to education, health and safety like we do. So often, we are sitting on a gold mine and
complaining about it. The psalmist sets an example for us in this morning’s text to tell our stories,
remembering to give God praise where praise is due. To do that, we have to pause, look around and
pay attention to how lucky we are to be alive right now.
This is not to say that there isn’t a place for lament or complaining. Clearly, in order to offer praise to
God for being drawn out from the pit, one must name the pit, describe the miry bog, list all the
iniquities that are more than the hairs on this poor Psalmist’s head. That is why I decided to share the
whole Psalm this morning, because we cannot understand the whole story of God’s deliverance
without the lament. God’s story of salvation only becomes powerful when we name the depth of the
crisis from which we were delivered. And yet the food that we live on in the midst of the crisis is the
story of salvation we tell in a song of praise, or as the psalmist says, a new song.
So what would your new song be for 2017? My 14-year-old, Gabbie, does this thing when a favorite
song of hers starts playing. Her face lights up and fingers start snapping, she starts swaying and she
announces to everyone standing nearby, “This is my jam!” There is just something about a song that
can capture your spirit exactly in the moment. So our first invitation this morning from the psalmist
would be to find your jam. Think about your life story and name the ways that God has delivered
you. I guarantee you that when you start listing them, the list will grow longer than you realize. What
pits have you inhabited and what had to happen for you to ascend out of that miry bog? I think it is
important to name the lament and the salvation back to back just as the Psalmist does. Don’t follow
my example and name one thing in a journal and another thing on Facebook 6 months apart. Put them
together, and that is the new song of praise God has put in your mouth.

The second invitation would be to share your whole story, to sing your new song of praise publicly in
the company of the congregation. Share it in your Sunday School class, circle group, or with anyone
who will listen. The Psalmist writes, “I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great
congregation; see, I have not restrained my lips…I have not concealed your steadfast love and your
faithfulness from the great congregation.” The psalmist feels it is not enough to journal about it or
quietly share it with our closest friends. We are called to sing our new songs in the presence of the
congregation so that all might hear and respond in praise.
While that sounds a little terrifying, I think the psalmist is spot on for a couple of reasons: to share the
entirety of our stories publicly is instructive, inspiring, healing and it strengthens our relationships
with each other. At any given time, the inhabitants of these pews are experiencing a time of great
blessing or great sorrow or something in between. When we share our stories, we can learn from each
other about different kinds of trials and most importantly, we learn about the many different ways in
which God responds. Hearing about another person’s journey can inspire us and help us cope in that
infuriating waiting period where we are supposed to be waiting patiently for the Lord. And as we
share our stories with one another, our relationships with God and with each other grow stronger and
deeper. Each of us has a song to share and over time, all of those songs form a great choir with
diversity and harmony.
Of course, it takes an abundance of courage to share your new song of lament and praise. It is hard to
be so vulnerable when we run the risk of being judged or becoming the subject of gossip which is
probably why we are often hesitant to share our songs. But if there is anything I have learned from
the bird’s eye view of my years in ministry, God’s grace, love and provision far outshines any crisis or
scandal. Every time, without fail.
It was not part of the plan for me to be a single mother in ministry. I can describe in epic and precise
detail what the inside of a desolate pit looks like, because I have spent plenty of my own life in there.
While I spent more nights crying out to God than I care to remember, I never could have created on
my own the song of deliverance that God put into my mouth. As I began the call process to become
ordained and installed as a minister, I fielded numerous questions about my single mother status in
interviews, so much so that I felt a scarlet D was forming on my chest. When I received a call to serve
a church here in Charlotte, they requested a biography to share with the congregation. We all felt it
was important to be transparent about my marital status which honestly was awkward and
uncomfortable for me.
Their first impression of me was to be formed by what I believed to be my biggest life failure.
Nothing could have prepared me, however, for the hands that raised, the arms that embraced. “Me
too, and you are one of us,” are the words that the great congregation would say. This very painful
and personal part of my story was exactly what opened the door to others sharing their stories of loss
which would not only heal and comfort but above all sing God’s praises. Any of you who have spent
time in a pit will know how to describe the darkness, but more than that, it is the bright light that is so
surprising and overwhelming. The bright light of friends that you never knew you had and visions of
love that you never knew existed. That is worthy of praise, dear friends, and God deserves all the
glory for such love and grace.
So what is your jam? Even if you aren’t sure about God’s salvation yet, start telling the story. Start
singing your song. You might be surprised where it takes you. Amen.",Lynne Keel,"Concord, NC",1/15/2017,
"Last week, while we were on the road for a brief vacation, we went into Cracker Barrel
for breakfast. If you've ever gone to a Cracker Barrel around any holiday time, you know that
the store out front is full of items themed for the season. In November and December, it is a
Christmas retail explosion. But when we went in to eat on December 28th, it was all gone. The
pathetic remnant of holiday wares that was left had been relegated to a little table in the corner
-- all of it marked to move at 70% off. Just three days after December 25th, Christmas at
Cracker Barrel had virtually disappeared.
Perhaps it is inevitable when we go so overboard as soon as November arrives. When
Christmas finally arrives, part of us is ready to move on. But there has always been a part of me
that is let down when Christmas is over. I am usually not quite ready to let it go. Perhaps that
is why, when I was fourteen, my grandmother gave me this little book as a Christmas gift. It
contains the Presbyterian preacher Peter Marshall's most famous sermon, which he called
""Let's Keep Christmas.""
When he wrote it, Marshall had not been in the United States for long. Some new
friends, knowing that his family was back home in Scotland, invited him to their home on
Christmas Eve. There, he had helped them decorate the tree. He sat on a stool in the kitchen
and cut out Christmas cookies, decorating them with cherries and nuts before they were baked.
He had joined them around the piano to sing “God Rest Ye, Merry Gentlemen.” Looking back
later, he would say that there was an unmistakable presence in that home -- something that
everyone had sensed. It was more than Christmas spirit, he said. “It was as if Christ Himself
had entered into that home.""
At the end of the evening, Peter did not want to go, but he had a long drive back to
Birmingham. As he gathered his things, the host said, “If you must go, I have just one request to
make of you. Will you have a prayer with us before you leave?” So, the family gathered around
the fireplace, and the young Scottish pastor led them in a heartfelt prayer in his pleasant
""Keeping Christmas""
Rev. Peter Bynum
January 1, 2017

Scottish accent -- a prayer which simply thanked God for the amazing gift of sending Christ into
the world.
Driving home alone that night, Marshall realized that the angels’ prophecy had truly
come to pass in that family – that with them there was “peace on earth, good will toward men.”
And as he thought he perceived other traces of that truth – light streaming from warm
windows, snatches of laughter audible even in a passing car, the songs of children singing
Christmas carols. And he was suddenly moved with a great wistfulness that brought tears to
his eyes. And in that wistfulness he found himself praying aloud in the car: “Oh, God, why can’t
more people, all of us, open our hearts to the wonderful spirit abroad in the world tonight – not
just on Christmas, but on every day? What a happy place this old earth could be if – oh, God, if
only we would keep Christmas the whole year through.”
Later, the joy that had become wistfulness, and the wistfulness that had become the
prayer, would become this sermon, which he named “Let’s Keep Christmas."" In the world, the
lights are coming down, radio stations have returned to normal, and empty trees are at the
street... but in the church, it is still Christmastide. We are still celebrating the birth of light and
life. The remainder of these words come from Peter Marshall, but I offer them to you today as
our collective Christmas prayer...
“Changes are everywhere. Many institutions and customs that we once thought sacrosanct
have gone by the board. Yet there are a few that abide, defying time and revolution.
The old message: “For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the
Lord” is still the heart of Christmas. It can be nothing else. And this message can neither be
changed nor quite forgotten, although there are many things that tend to make us forget. …
There is no need to search for stories new and different. There is only one after all – and
no modern author can improve it:
“And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over
their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the
Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them,
“Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.
For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord.”
We all feel the pressure of approaching Christmas. The traffic is terrible. You can’t find
a parking space… The stores are crowded… Mob scenes make shopping a nightmare. You are
thinking about presents – wondering what in the world you can get for so-and-so. You think of
friends and loved ones who are so hard to shop for. You can’t think of anything they need
(which is rather strange when you take time to think of it).
Maybe there is nothing in a store that they need. But what about some token of love –
what about love itself… and friendship … and understanding… and consideration… and a
helping hand… and a smile… and a prayer?
You can’t buy these things in any store, and these are the very things people need. We
all need them… Blessed will they be who receive them this Christmas or at any time. Let’s not
permit the crowds and the rush to crowd Christmas out of our hearts, for that is where it
belongs. Christmas is not in the stores – but in the hearts of people.
I thank God for Christmas. Would that it lasted all year. For on Christmas Eve, and
Christmas Day, all the world is a better place, and men and women are more lovable. Love itself
seeps into every heart, and miracles happen.
Page 3 of 3
When Christmas doesn’t make your heart swell up until it nearly bursts… and fill your
eyes with tears… and make you soft and warm inside … then you’ll know that something inside
of you is dead…
Isn’t it wonderful to think that nothing can really harm the joy of Christmas. Although
your Christmas tree decorations will include many new gadgets, such as lights with bubbles in
them, it’s the old tree decorations that mean the most… The ones you save carefully from year
to year… that crooked star that goes on the top of the tree… the ornaments that you’ve been so
careful with.
And you’ll bring out the tiny manger, and the shed, and the little figures of the Holy
Family… and lovingly arrange them on the mantel or in the middle of the dining room table.
There will be the fragrance of cookies baking spices and fruit cake, and the warmth of
the house shall be melodious with the lilting strains of “Silent Night, Holy Night.”
And you’ll listen to the wonderful Christmas music on the radio. Some of the songs will
be modern – good enough music perhaps – but it will be the old carols, the lovely old Christmas
hymns that will mean the most.
And forests of trees will march right into our living rooms. There will be bells on our
doors and holly wreaths in our windows. And we shall sweep the Noel skies for their brightest
colors and festoon our homes with stars…
And finally Christmas morning will come. Don’t worry – you’ll be ready for it. You’ll
catch the spirit all right, or it will catch you, which is even better.
And then you will remember what Christmas means – the beginning of Christianity… the
second chance for the world… the hope for peace… and the only way. The promise that the
angels sang is the most wonderful music the world has ever heard. “Peace on earth and good
will toward men.” It was not a pronouncement upon the state of the world then, nor is it a
reading of the international barometer of the present time… but it is a promise – God’s promise
– of what one day will come to pass.
The years that are gone are graveyards in which all the persuasions of men have
crumbled into dust. If history has any voice, it is to say that all these ways of men lead
nowhere. There remains one way – The Way – untried, untested, unexplored fully… the way of
Him Who was born a babe in Bethlehem.
In a world that seems not only to be changing, but even to be dissolving, there are some
tens of millions of us who want Christmas to be the same...
We long for the abiding love among men of good will which the season brings…
believing in this ancient miracle of Christmas with its softening, sweetening influence to tug at
our heart strings once again. We want to hold on to the old customs and traditions because
they strengthen our family ties, bind us to our friends, make us one with all mankind for whom
the Child was born, and bring us back again to the God Who gave His only begotten Son, that
“whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
So, we will not “spend” Christmas… nor “observe” Christmas.
We will “keep” Christmas – keep it as it is… in all the loveliness of its ancient traditions.
May we keep it in our hearts, that we may be kept in its hope. Amen. ",Peter Bynum,"Concord, NC",1/1/2017,
"In just a few minutes  Miles Duncan Heyward and Michael William Washo will each be “sealed in baptism by the Holy Spirit and marked as Christ’s own forever.” While the norm for the church is adult baptism, I love baptizing infants who have done nothing to harm anyone and nothing to earn God’s love or our love. Yet this is all about the affirmation of what is  — God’s preexisting, never failing love and care for each of them.

Their baptism will not cut on a switch that makes God start to love them at that instance but affirms to all the world that God already loves Miles and that already God loves Michael. It is not fire insurance and it will not guarantee their acceptance into any of the church schools in the diocese of Virginia or the Country Club or UVA or any other institution and it will not get them a job on Wall Street.

However, in their baptism they will become fully vested members of the Body of Christ – they will not have to serve for 12 or 13 years before they can take part or prove that they are good enough to be members of the Church. They not have to prove that they understand what Holy Communion is all about to receive the Body and Blood of Christ. Today at their baptism they are full members. You see, baptism is the sacrament – the outward and visible sign of the inward and spiritual grace that is full inclusion into the Body of Christ with all its privileges and all it responsibilities.

The symbols we use in baptism are water, oil, candle bread and wine. I am going to tell Miles and Michael about these symbols and invite you to listen in.

With every baptism around the world whether in parish church, in tiny house church, in great cathedral, or by grandmothers in secret – water is used. By water we are baptized in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

Water that reminds us of the power of God at creation and the River Jordan which God’s people crossed to enter the promised land, water that Jesus was baptized in, water that Jesus calmed.

Water is the source of life – we cannot live without it.

Water links us with all others who have been baptized with Christ. Water marks our connection with the past and with Christians around the world. The waters of baptism are the source of life of community which is changed by your inclusion into it.

By the water of baptism you share the sacred stories of Christians down through the ages, becoming part of their story and allowing others to be part of yours. Miles and Michael, water is the symbol that there is love before any hurt you will ever experience and long after you are dead, there will be love.

Oil is a symbol of empowerment by which kings and prophets of Israel anointed. Even kings and queens today.

Oil is extravagant, luxurious — oil in bath water, on hands your hands and body – enriching and nourishing.

We remember the anointing of Jesus and the concern that the oil was so extravagant it could have been sold to buy food for the poor. Oil is the symbol of God’s extravagant love.           Oil links us with the wider church — blessed by the bishop to use as the priest says “you are sealed by the Holy Spirit & marked as Christ’s own forever.” Whenever I go to the hospital and visit the sick or dying, I anoint them with oil and remind them that they are sealed in baptism by the Holy Spirit, marked as Christ’s own forever and nothing in all creation can separate them from God’s love. They are beloved of God and nothing they can do and no place they can go will change that. Miles and Michael, there will always a place at the Lord’s table with your name on it. They will never be alone.

The Candle is of the Light of Christ – the Pascal Candle lit at the Great Vigil of Easter which transforms the darkness of the tomb. It always burns at baptisms & funerals bringing light into the darkest corners of our lives, a symbol of God’s victory over death; of God’s power to bring new life. The candle is also a reminder that we are to take the light of Christ out into the world.

Christianity is at its heart a story. It is a story with two major characters — God and humankind. It is God’s story because it is the story of God’s love. It is our story because it is a story of our response. The theme is God’s deep desire for relationship with humankind and our desperate need for relationship with God. It is a story that is filled with imagery. It is a sacred story. It is a story that is not finished for God continues to act today, in the constant unfolding of new life. God is at work in Dallas, in Orlando, in Nice, in Istanbul and in every city and town where there is strife and fear and violence.

 

God continues to provide us opportunities to experience God’s grace which challenges us to be God’s spirit alive in the world; commissioning us, empowering us and strengthening us to see the face of God in every face we encounter.

It is a profound privilege and an equally profound responsibility to be a community that takes baptism seriously. As we choose to welcome these children into the Body of Christ that gathers here at St. James’s, we choose to share their stories and our lives are changed.

It is our responsibility to be the voice that challenges all the voices of the world that would say to them that they are not good enough, not smart enough, not rich, pretty or strong enough, that their beliefs or family or race or gender or orientation is not good enough. Our responsibility is to pray for them and to tell them the story of Jesus and his love.

Our responsibility is to welcome them every time they enter the doors of the church and every time they come to the altar rail to share the loaf of bread and the cup of wine. Our responsibility is to challenge them and to teach them how to live the life of God’s beloved. Our responsibility to show them with our words and actions that they belong to this Body of Christ where ever they are in the world. Our responsibility is to walk with them on their journey of faith as they become the people God created them to be and to remind them that there will always be a place at the Lord’s table for them.

Our responsibility is to remind them that they are sealed in baptism by the Holy Spirit and marked as Christ’s own forever and not anything in all creation can take that away from them.

Our responsibility is to offer them a space where they can grow in strength and courage to be instruments of God’s peace in this fractured world.

In the midst of the divisions, the hatred, the violence, the loss of life and the terror of these past days and weeks, I am especially grateful for the sacrament that binds us together as God’s beloved children. As my own beloved children, grandchildren, God children, the children I have baptized, those I have taught and those who I love in this parish have grown and travel beyond my ability to care for them, I am profoundly grateful for their belonging to the Body of Christ where ever they are, held in the palm of God’s hand forever.

Today as you go to the altar rail for communion, I invite you to dip your fingers into the baptismal waters and remind yourself that you too are a beloved child of God, sealed in baptism by the Holy Spirit and marked as Christ’s own forever and ever.

Amen",Caroline Parkinson,"Richmond, VA",7/17/2016,
"The images keep being replayed on television, in the newspapers, online, and in my head. They are of violence brought on by hatred, bigotry, loss of identity and fear. The heartbreaking event in Orlando last Sunday morning can’t help but to bring to mind so many other random acts of violence we have witnessed and wept over – acts of terrorism, domestic and foreign. Like others who have made similar choices, Omar Mateen wanted us to think he was a warrior of holiness. Instead he was filled with hatred, made choices that can never be undone, murdered men and women who had so much to offer the world, their community and their loved ones.

Yet again we have been brutally reminded of the evil in our world, how fragile life is and how precious those we love. Demonic possession is not something we talk about much except when we are watching Friday the 13th movies, TV shows or sometimes like today in stories from the Bible. However, we do know from experience the power of evil. We have seen it in our life times in genocide rampant in China, Russia, Germany, the Sudan, Nigeria, Rwanda, Syria, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, and the list goes on.

Violence is about taking away from people their God given gift of life. Terrorism is about random acts of violence against innocent people, acts intended to diminish our capacity to hope and dream, acts intended to cause paralyzing fear that keeps us chained like the man filled with a legion of demons who Jesus set free on that hillside on the other side of the Sea of Galilee.

I dare to speak about such random violence because I have experienced it – lost family members not to the hatred and bigotry experienced in Orlando and San Bernardino but to violence every bit as random; and I know that some of you have as well. It is a family’s worst nightmare. That phone call was heart breaking and terrible. How? Why? The young man who murdered my niece and great nephew lived around the block, went to the same school, wrestled on the wrestling team with Jim had been in their home and yet he made such different choices, ending the possibilities for his own life as well as ending the lives of two other wonderful individuals and changing forever the lives of all who loved them. He did not go to a gun store and buy a gun but when he broke into the house searching for items to sell for drugs he found a gun my father had given my nephew many years before and in the process took two precious lives.

In our own city there have been 27 people murdered – twice as many in 2016 to date as there were a year ago and so many others whose lives were changed forever. We all know that it is not about statistics but about people we love, members of our families, our children and their friends and loved ones. It is about relationships, hopes, dreams and possibilities that have been ended tragically. Each death reminds us of the preciousness of every single life. There are no spare lives! Our job as followers of the way of Jesus is to seek ways of changing the situation in whatever – even the smallest way — that is open to us.

In a sermon preached a few weeks ago, my dear friend The Rev. Frank Wade spoke about the porous nature of death. He said “it is an ending and a beginning, a continuum, a point where things end but do not stop. People die, so do relationships, ambitions, eras, traditions, assumptions, aspirations, youth, institutions, dreams and memories. They all end but they do not stop. That is the somewhat hard and bumpy truth….. The fact is that life in all of its forms and death in all of its forms are in God’s hands. We are accountable to God for how we manage life and how we respond to death, how we begin and how we end. ” (The Rev. Dr. Francis H. Wade: Sermon preached at Church of the Holy Trinity, Phil. PA, June 5, 2016)

We must take care not to engage in random acts of violence ourselves. In our baptismal covenant, we have promised to strive for justice and peace among all people and to respect the dignity of every human being – there are no spare lives! We are charged with bringing the peace of God into every event. When we do that we find that we are living in hope of what could be rather than in fear of what might be and only then we are freed from the grip of evil.

We have prayed and must keep praying for those who were killed last Sunday and in San Bernardino, Charleston, Fort Hood, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech, Tucson, Columbine, and New York – as well as for their families and those who loved them and those who killed them. We need to pray for our leaders as they discern their way over the next several years, praying for one another as we face this challenge. We need to pray for those who hate us. It doesn’t mean that we cannot hold accountable those who have caused each outrage, we must for the sake of our world.

In the Eastern Orthodox tradition one of the prayers prayed every night is “Lord, we pray for those who hate us …. and those who love us.” The Orthodox Christians know much about enemies having experienced years of life under repressive Communist and Muslim regimes. If we were to pray for peace, to pray for those who hate us and the enemies of all those we love, I believe it would shape us as a people to be Christ’s presence in this hate filled and divided world.

Luke’s Gospel account today tells of the only time Jesus crossed over into predominantly Gentile territory – he crossed the boundary that no good Jewish rabbi would cross. It was his first and his last foray into Gentile territory. It probably represents Jesus’ command to “make disciples of all nations ” and the struggles of the early followers of the way of Jesus to carry out his command. The Apostle Paul had to remind his readers in Galicia, in Rome, and in Corinth that there is no Jew or Greek, no male or female, no slave or free.

In the midst of the horror God has wept with us and God has sought us in every dark and desperate place, even in the twisted rubble and among the carnage, showing us that love is greater than hatred. It is in the midst of being reminded of the lack of peace in the world that we are preparing to send our beloved rector off to the other side of the Potomac River, to serve God in a city that knows even more violence than Richmond and a Cathedral that has the presence to address the issues.

With the bishop of the Diocese of Washington, Randy will be the face of the Episcopal Church in our nation’s capital. He will hear the Cathedral bells calling the faithful to prayer and walk past the Peace Cross which over looks the city that is the heart of our nation’s identity. He will address the nation at times of crisis and celebration. He will undoubtedly smile as he watches children from the Cathedral Schools and tourists lovingly reach out to touch the hand of the bronze statue of Jesus in the Children’s chapel knowing that the future is in their hands.

Randy, your ministry here at St. James’s is ending but it will not stop. The gifts of your preaching, your teaching, your pastoral presence, your passion for God and your sure and certain knowledge that you are God’s beloved child and together we are called to be doers of God’s word not hearers only – those gifts will not stop. In other stories of Jesus encounters, he issued an invitation, “Come, follow me.” In this case Jesus said: “declare how much God has done for you.” The story is one of commissioning, a call to ministry.

Randy you are being called to a new ministry, a beginning even as this ministry among us is ending. As you preach and teach in our nation’s capital, continue to declare how much God has done for you; continue to share your passion for God and your knowledge that we are all God’s beloved children, black and white, male and female, gay and straight, native American or foreign born; continue to share the spirit of the living God that fills you with peace and work in every way however small to bring peace to this hate filled and divided world. As you walk through the Nave in the late afternoon when the sun streams through the Rose Window, dancing on the pillars of the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul, remember that you are being held in our prayers.

Randy, it has been a joy and a privilege to serve God in this place with you and now may God grant us all a longing for peace, a thirst for justice, and a willingness to give of ourselves in the spirit of Christ. Amen",Caroline Parkinson,"Richmond, VA",6/30/2016,
"The wonderful preacher Fred Craddock once told a story about a lecture he gave at a seminary on the west coast. Just before his first talk, one of the students stood up and said, “Before you speak, I need to know if you are Pentecostal.” The room quickly grew silent. Craddock said he looked around for the Dean of the seminary to see if he could get some help.  The Dean was nowhere to be found. The student continued with his quiz right in front of everybody. “Are you a Pentecostal?” he asked again. Craddock was taken aback, and so he said, “Do you mean do I belong to the Pentecostal Church?” He said, “No, I mean are you Pentecostal?” Craddock replied, “Are you asking me if I am charismatic?” The student said, “I am asking you if you are Pentecostal.” Craddock said, “Do you want to know if I speak in tongues?” He said, “I want to know if you are Pentecostal.” Craddock said, “I don’t know what your question is.” The student said, “Obviously, you are not Pentecostal” and he left the room.[1]

Well, I am Pentecostal. I am not “a” Pentecostal, but I am Pentecostal. I am all about the Holy Spirit present in the life of the church and in my own life as well. In fact, I think when the church is alive in the world it is only because it is Pentecostal – full of the Spirit. So, St. James’s, at our best we are Pentecostal. And you thought we were Episcopalian!

In our gospel for this morning, Jesus tells his disciples that he must leave them but that he will not leave them alone. He will give them the gift of the Holy Spirit, the same Spirit that descended on Jesus at his baptism in the Jordan River. This Holy Spirit will be like a counselor, an advocate, to sustain them and guide them into the future. Pentecost, the source of the adjective Pentecostal, comes from the book of Acts and refers to the day when the disciples received God’s Holy Spirit – the 50th day after Easter, pentekonta in Greek. It is the day we celebrate the birthday of the church. So if Pentecost refers to the day when the Holy Spirit was given to the church, then to be Pentecostal is to live in power and the presence of the Spirit.

What is the Holy Spirit? In short, it is God’s love at work amongst us. It is what animates this place. It is what makes the baptized part of the body of Christ. It is what makes us more than a bunch of lukewarm Christians. It is our muse, our conscience, our cheerleader, our guide. It moves us to pray even when we aren’t sure there is anyone out there listening. It enables us to forgive even when we have good reason to hate. It keeps us caring when we could easily turn inward. It keeps us striving to do for others even though we might comfortably think we are doing enough. The Holy Spirit is what changed the disciples from being a bunch of terrified men, hiding in fear after their master was crucified, into the leaders of a movement willing to risk life and limb to spread the good news of Jesus Christ across a significant portion of the planet. The Spirit is what prods and pokes, challenges and cajoles us. It never violates our free will, but if we are willing to follow the Spirit’s movement, it can profoundly change our lives. The Spirit is everything to the church.

I remember so well sixteen years ago being quite happy in Savannah, Georgia as the Rector of St. Peter’s. I was part of a great church, a growing church, and we had a happy life there. When someone contacted me and asked if I would let my name be submitted as a possible candidate for Rector of St. James’s, I wasn’t at all sure. In fact, I was pretty sure it was probably a bad idea. Why try and fix something that wasn’t broken? Why enter a search process with dozens of other good candidates and risk rejection when I had a good thing going? Why move when everything was going so well just the way it was? After being asked, I remember stalling for weeks unclear what to do. But during those weeks, in the quite moments of my day, in my silent times of prayer, I could feel the nudges, the prodding, the pull of the Spirit on my heart. I could feel it in my guts. I could feel the Spirit pushing through my fear, my hesitation, my worry. I could feel the Spirit urging me on, encouraging me to take the risk and enter into the process. I know it was the Spirit because I know those nudges weren’t coming from me, they were coming from beyond me. In the end, whether the search committee selected me to come to St. James’s or not, I knew I was being called by the Spirit to be a part of that search process. I knew I was being called to come here.

The Spirit moves in all of our lives. It isn’t just for the church or the clergy. All of us have callings, big and little, moments when the Spirit moves, nudging us in new directions. I remember having lunch some time ago with a member of the parish who decided she wanted to be baptized.  After taking Pilgrim’s Path and hanging around our community, she knew she was ready to make a commitment. We were having lunch to catch up and discuss the big day. During the conversation she mentioned that she had an estranged brother she had not spoken to in over a year. This estranged brother struggled with substance abuse. He was manipulative, untrustworthy, and after years of trying to help him my friend knew it was better for her and her family if she just broke off all ties. However, this brother had recently become a father and now, after more than a year of silence, she was wondering if she ought to reach out and try again. Here she was on the verge of her baptism, on the edge of claiming a new life for herself, a life in Christ, and I have no doubt that it was the Spirit moving in her heart and in her soul. I have no doubt it was the Spirit opening her up, helping her to let go of anger and hurt, encouraging her to take a risk to reach out to her brother and try again, one more time – in the name of love.

The Rev. Barbara Brown Taylor once described the Holy Spirit this way: “When Jesus let go of his last breath – willingly, we believe, for love of us – that breath hovered in the air in front of him for a moment and then it was set loose on earth. It was such a pungent breath, so full of passion, so full of life that it did not simply dissipate as so many breaths do. It grew, in strength and in volume, until it was a mighty wind, which God sent spinning through an upper room in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. God wanted to make sure that Jesus’ friends were the inheritors of Jesus’ breath, and it worked!” My brothers and sisters, have you ever sensed the Spirit moving in your life? It is there with you, as close as your own breath. As God’s love at work in the world, the Holy Spirit always seeks to help you be the best version of you that you can be. It seeks your fulfillment, completion, wholeness. It is the source of the peace that Jesus promises us, a peace that the world cannot give. Pray for it to move in your life. Pray for the insight to recognize it at work in the lives of others. Pray for it to burn brightly within our church community. Because without it we are lost. But with it we become the hands and feet of Christ in the world.

Come Holy Spirit, come.
Come as the fire and burn.
Come as the wind and cleanse.
Come as the light and reveal.
Convict, convert, consecrate
Until we are wholly Thine.
Come Holy Spirit, come. Amen.",Randolph Marshall Hollerith,"Richmond, VA",5/1/2016,
"Welcome! We are so glad you are here with is today. Whether this is your first time at St. James’s or you come every Sunday, welcome. We are so glad you are here to celebrate the most joyful day in the Christian year.

There is a 1600-year-old tradition in the church that says every Easter should start with a joke because God played a joke on the Devil Easter morning by raising Jesus from the dead. It’s called the Risus Paschalis – the Easter laugh. So here you go. Have you heard the old story about a priest and a taxi driver who both died and went to heaven? St. Peter was at the Pearly gates waiting for them. ‘Come with me,’ said St. Peter to the taxi driver. The cabbie did as he was told and followed St Peter to a mansion. It had everything you could imagine from a bowling alley and tennis courts to an Olympic size pool. Wow, this is wonderful, thank you,’ said the taxi driver. Next, St. Peter led the priest to an old broken-down shack with a bunk bed and an old black and white TV. Surprised, the priest said, ‘Wait, I think you are a little mixed up. Shouldn’t I be the one who gets the mansion? After all I was a priest, went to church every day, and preached God’s word.’ ‘Yes, that’s true.’ St Peter said, ‘But during your Easter sermons people slept. But, when that cabbie drove his cab, everyone prayed.’

Well, I certainly hope I don’t put you to sleep this Easter. But what I do hope, what every preacher hopes on Easter, is that you will hear the good news of this day in a new way, that the love of God shown to us in the resurrection of Jesus might move you in ways it never has before. Because, no matter who you are or why you are here, this is your day. Maybe you are one of those people who cannot imagine not being in church on Easter – and just about every other Sunday, for that matter. Maybe you are one of those people who, for whatever reason, only gets to church on Christmas and Easter. Maybe you came this morning just to make your spouse happy or your parents happy, or your in-laws happy. Maybe you came for the kids, or to see the beautiful flowers and sing the old familiar hymns. Maybe you are curious about his whole empty tomb, resurrection thing. Whatever the case, the fact that you are here is evidence that God is moving in your life. That’s right, God is moving in your life, whispering in your ear. I hope you will pay attention. So welcome, this day is for you. It is God’s gift to you, and to me. It is God telling us that we are loved so much that not even death has the final word. It is God telling us that life is stronger than death and that love is stronger than the grave.

But I am moving too quickly. Let’s back up for a minute. Let’s go to the beginning of our story for today. When Mary Magdalene came to the tomb on Easter morning, she thought she had lost everything she cared about. Mary was frightened and in despair. In fact, all the disciples were frightened and most of them were in hiding. The man they had pledged their lives to, this wonderful teacher and healer named Jesus, who they thought was the promised Messiah, had been arrested, condemned and executed, all in a very short period of time. From their point of view, the world was as it had always been. The powerful always win over the weak and death always has the last word in this life.

Mary, standing in that garden full of grief and sadness, faced the same kind of questions you and I face every time we stand in front of the grave of someone we love, every time we are confronted by death. How do we make sense of our existence when, in spite of all our striving, our dreams, all our triumphs, our lives seem to end in the same place – at the grave? How do we avoid despair when we ponder the ultimate fate of everything and everyone? Woody Allen once said in an interview that there is nothing in this life that doesn’t end in destruction. As a result, nothing in life really has much meaning. In light of this terrible reality, the job of the artist, Allen said, is to help people understand why it’s still worth going on. He admitted that this is a “tough assignment”.

Standing in that garden, Mary knew the pain of destruction and death. What Mary could never have imagined, was that there was an alternative. What Mary could never have imagined, was that the tomb was empty. Indeed, she had no idea what was happening until Jesus spoke her name. But in that one word, in that split second of recognition, Mary knew that God’s love and God’s promises are bigger than suffering, bigger than the grave. Jesus was alive, the grave could not hold him. He was not a ghost, he had not been resuscitated, rather he had risen from the dead, transformed and totally alive. At that moment the world was forever changed and the good news of this day is that those who trust in Jesus are promised that they too will follow their Lord from death into life. Abbott Marc Oraison once said that death is nothing more than the final stage of birth. I like that idea. In this sense, when we die we don’t reach our end, rather, because of Christ, we move from life to life. Death becomes just another event in the ongoing process of living – something one lives through with Christ.

The question this Easter Day is – where are you going to stand in all of this? On which side of the tomb are you going to stake your claim? Is the tomb open and empty, or is it sealed tight? Maybe you don’t have all the answers, maybe you don’t even understand some of the questions, but can you trust the good news of this day enough to build your life on it? If not, where are you going to find your hope? If you are going to stand with Woody Allen, then God bless you. I can’t do it. I’ve been down that road and for me it leads nowhere.

My friends, I know it sometimes seems like we live in a permanent Good Friday world. You can’t open the paper without reading about death and destruction. The tragic events this week in Brussels seem all to common in our world today. But I agree with the Rev. Sam Lloyd when he says that Christians are supposed to live with a kind of defiant joy. Christians are supposed to hold up in the world all that is good and redemptive and life giving because we know this Good Friday world doesn’t have the last word. We are supposed to live with defiant joy because when all is said and done, we know there is a love that cannot be defeated. The same love that rolled away the stone and raised Jesus from the dead. The same love that promises to raise all of us as well. Wendell Berry in one of his poems said that we should be joyful though we have considered all the facts. I like that. I get that. In a poem that describes this kind of defiant joy he writes, “So, friends, every day do something that won’t compute. Love the Lord. Love the world. Work for nothing. … Love someone who does not deserve it. … Ask questions that have no answers. … Expect the end of the world. Laugh. Laughter is immeasurable. Be joyful though you have considered all the facts. … Practice resurrection.”

My brothers and sisters, today we come together to proclaim resurrection. We sing “Welcome Happy Morning” and “Hail Thee Festival Day.” In spite of the world around us, we stand together as Christians have for more than 2,000 years and proclaim – Alleluia, Christ is risen! So – Alleluia, Christ is risen! The Lord is risen indeed. Alleluia. Amen.",Randolph Marshall Hollerith,"Richmond, VA",3/27/2016,
"Well hello, St. James’s. It’s great to see all of you and great to be back together as our 9:00 family. I hope you all have had a wonderful summer. I know that I have. In fact, I want to tell you a story about something that happened to Melissa and me near the end of the summer. It is really Melissa’s story to tell but she shared it during her homily for the opening chapel service at St. Christopher’s. Some of you have already heard it, and there was even a story like it in Friday’s Times Dispatch, so I apologize for being redundant, but I think it is a story worth sharing.

A number of weeks ago, Melissa and I were watching TV one evening when the home phone rang. On the caller ID it read that the call was from an “unknown” number which usually means it is some kind of a robocall or other type of solicitation. So we didn’t answer it. When the answering machine kicked on we didn’t expect anyone to leave a message but we heard this voice saying: “Uh, hello, I’m calling for Melissa Hollerith. My name is Jordan and I’m calling from the White House …” Well, Melissa and I looked at each other with puzzled looks and she jumped up to answer the phone.

Okay, now bear with me, I have to back up to June 26 when President Obama delivered the eulogy for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was among those gunned down in Charleston, SC by Dylann Roof. Melissa and I both saw the broadcast of that service. As clergy, we were impressed by the President’s words – his theology, his tone of reconciliation, forgiveness and justice. As a priest who has had to speak far too many times to people gathered together to mourn a tragic death, I was impressed by what he said and how he said it and I knew it was not easy. Most of all we were touched by the President’s risky move to end his homily with the singing of Amazing Grace. It was a powerful moment and Melissa and I talked about for some time afterwards. At one point, Melissa said to me, “I am going to email the White House and tell the President how moved and grateful we are for what he said under such difficult circumstances.” Being the cynic that I am, I immediately told her that she would be wasting her time, the White House gets thousands of emails everyday and her message will only disappear into some digital black hole. But she insisted she was going to do it anyway.

Now, fast forward to the phone call. When Melissa picked up the phone, Jordan introduced herself and said, “I am one of the event planners on the White House staff and I am calling because the President was very moved by your email.” (I swear; I am not making this up.) “The President asked me to find a suitable event here at the White House that we might invite you to attend.” Well, I could see Melissa’s face and if her mouth could have hung open any wider it would have touched the floor. Jordan continued, “We were wondering if you and a guest would be willing to join us on the morning of September 23 on the White House lawn to meet and welcome Pope Francis to the United States?” Isn’t that an amazing story? Melissa’s going to meet the Pope and I get to be her guest! It goes to show what can happen when we take the time and the effort to share our words of gratitude and appreciation. It shows what can happen when we speak up and let someone know when their actions have touched us and blessed us.

In our Epistle this morning, James writes about the blessing that our words can be to others. He talks about the power of the human tongue, the power of our words to either bless or curse. “The tongue is a fire,” he writes. “With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in the likeness of God. From the same mouth come blessing and curse.” He warns his readers of the danger of the human tongue, its destructive power and its creative possibility.

These words from James are dramatically played out in our Gospel reading for today. Jesus and his disciples have taken a break from their traveling and they are resting near Caesarea Philippi. This is the midway point in the Gospel of Mark and the disciples have been following Jesus for some time. They have seen his miracles, they have heard his profound teaching, the have watched him love and care for others in extraordinary ways. Jesus takes this pause in their travels to test them. He wants to know if the disciples have discovered the truth about him. “Who do people say that I am?” he asks them. They respond that some believe he is John the Baptist back from the dead, a prophet, or maybe even Elijah who is prophesied to return to earth and herald the arrival of the Messiah. But then Jesus asks them, “But who do you say that I am?” Here we have a great example of the power of the human tongue that James talks about in his epistle. Peter, alone among the others, speaks up and takes a tremendous risk and says, “You are the Messiah.” There it is out in the open, Peter dares to speak the words, Jesus is more than a great rabbi, more than a prophet, he is the savior, the one they have all been waiting for. Jesus must have been relieved to here Peter say those words. He must have been gratified that Peter had the faith to say such a seemingly crazy thing.

But no sooner does Jesus begin to explain that the Messiah must lay down his own life, that he must suffer and die, then Peter uses his words, his bold tongue to berate Jesus for not being the right kind of Messiah. Jesus can’t suffer and die, Peter tells him, he’s the Savior, he has to defeat to Roman occupiers and restore the Kingdom of Israel. But Jesus knows that this kind of earthly power is not the will of his Father. He recognizes in Peter’s angry rebuttal the Devil’s temptation to rule all the kingdoms of the earth and he tells Peter – “Get behind me, Satan!” In one short passage Peter uses his tongue to bless and to curse – to proclaim Jesus as the Messiah and then to condemn him for not being the right kind of Messiah.

Do we realize the power of our words? Do we take the time to share our words of gratitude and appreciation with others in order to bless them, in order to build them up and encourage them? Even when those words seem as inconsequential as one email among thousands. Do we go out of our way to say to the people in our lives – thank you, I appreciate you, I am grateful for your friendship, I value your hard work, or even – I love you? On the flip side, do we understand how devastating and destructive our words can be when we lash out and say cruel things, especially to those people who love us? Because when you love someone, that love makes you extremely vulnerable. Therefore, when someone you love lashes out with words intended to hurt, those words can cut to the bone. More importantly, once you’ve said something you can never take it back again. You can apologize, but you cannot unsay it. And I have seen it in numerous marriages over the years, including my own, words intended to wound leave scars that never really go away.  As James reminds us, we have to learn to tame our tongues.

My brothers and sisters, as we begin the program year, as we return to Sunday school, Bible study classes, mission trips and all kinds of ministries, never forget that your Christian witness lies not only in the good work you do for Christ but also in the words you chose to say and not say. Are you bold enough to speak against the friend when he or she makes the racist comment or do you chose silence as the safer alternative? Are you willing to push your comfort zones and go out of your way to welcome the stranger? Do you have the confidence and the comfort to say to those outside your church family – “My faith is important to me, I am a follower of Jesus Christ and I would love to share with you what I have discovered through my faith.” How many of us have even the courage to have this conversation with our own children? Lots of people are always surprised when they learn that only about 50% of our members make a pledge to our life together. But most of those same people see this as a problem I am supposed to fix. How many of us are willing to say to our brothers and sisters in this church – I make a pledge to support the work going on at St. James’s and I hope you will too. Imagine what we could accomplish if that was a more regular topic of conversation?

Never forget that the primary thing we do as a Christian community is to come together and use our voices to praise God in worship. We begin the service with – “Blessed be God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit” and we end every service with “Thanks be to God.” Using our tongues to sing God’s praises is a central part of our faith. As we kick off another program year it is my hope and my prayer that we can praise God not just on Sunday morning but in every part of our lives and in every part of our day. That we can honestly say with the Psalmist – O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise. Amen.",Randolph Marshall Hollerith,"Richmond, VA",9/13/2015,
"Good morning!
As most of you know by now, I am Hilary Streever, your new associate rector, and I am delighted to be here. Today is the first time I have stood in a pulpit since Pentecost Sunday, and boy does it feel good.

My husband David and I moved to Richmond in early June from the far, far southwest corner of our state. We really look forward to getting to know you all and working with you to serve God and our neighbors in the coming days, months and years.

Last week was time for me to begin learning new names and new places. A time for me to get lost on our campus here! A time for me to begin absorbing who you are and what you do.

For DOERS you are! DOERS is your identity.

When I first started looking into you and who you are, my first encounter with your identity was simply your website address – no stjamesepiscopal.org or stjamesrichmond.thediocese.org for you guys – No – you want people to know even as they search for your parish online that you are doers.

Yet, as I took in the beauty of the sanctuary here, I was struck by the presence of not one but two verbs:
to do and to be.

Above the altar: BE ye doers…

To your right in this corner, the banner that says: Be ye doers and then, just below: the holy name of God revealed to Moses: I will be who I will be. For one of the holy names of God given us in the Hebrew Bible, YHWH, can be translated to mean be-ing. I am who I am. Be-ing. Existence itself.

And Jesus as God incarnate picks up that verb to be in the Gospel of John:
I AM the light.
I AM the way.
I Am the truth.
I AM living water.
I AM bread from heaven.
I AM the Good Shepherd.
I AM, I AM, directly identifying himself Jesus as God, YHWH.

So we come to one reason why God the Son, the capital-W Word of God, ever became incarnate as Jesus of Nazareth in the first place. Or, as Paul puts it this morning, why God himself, though he was rich, became poor for us. Because it wasn’t enough for God to reveal who God is to us in creation, or in the spoken and written words of scripture; it wasn’t enough for God to reveal who God is by speaking through the prophets. We needed God the capital-W Word who gave us the lower-case-w word, to fulfill the written word, to embody it, to show us in the best way that we can relate, by becoming one of us, and by showing us in his own spoken words and actions, WHO GOD IS.

Christ shows us what it means to BE. From Christ’s BE-ing, from his identity as GOD, comes his DO-ing: creating, healing, feeding, giving, loving, listening, redeeming, living, dying, resurrecting. Christ doesn’t just do these things because he’s a nice guy.
Christ does these things because he is God and that is who God IS. Christ’s actions reveal God’s BE-ING.

But God doesn’t stop there. There’s another reason. As God says through the prophet Isaiah:
As my word goes forth from my mouth, so shall it not return to me empty. Or as Jesus says in the Gospel according to John: All those the Father gives me will come to me, and this is the will of him who sent me, that I shall lose none of those he has given me.

In other words: God created us and God redeemed us, so that in the power of the Holy Spirit, we may BE with God: brought back into holy relationship with God the Trinity, the one who IS, the one who IS LIFE itself, who is the ground of our being,
who makes us truly alive. That is what eternal life and salvation ARE – BE-ing with God.

This is illustrated in our Gospel lesson this morning. When Jesus speaks with Jairus, the father of the little girl who is dying, he tells him, “Do not be afraid, but believe.” Believe. We often think of “belief” as meaning merely an intellectual assent, like: Yes, I believe that the plumber is coming over at 2:00 today.
But Christian belief goes deeper than that. The English word belief comes from the German word liege — LOVE.

So when Jesus says, believe, he is inviting us not just to assent intellectually to him, but to join him in loving relationship. The one who loved us before we were even a twinkle in our parents’ eyes, the one who loved us so much that he became incarnate and hung on a cross and defeated death and gave us the gift of the Holy Spirit – is asking us to love him. BE LIEBE – BELOVED – to be the Beloved’s beloved!

For we become like that which we be liebe, believe, love, worship. Loving God, we affirm that we want to become like Christ. And loving God means loving our neighbors. Jesus said, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.”

This is why we follow Christ. So that, being loved by God and loving God in return, we may love each other too. This love manifests itself when we participate with God in doing the things Jesus did: Bearing the divine love and light and life that God so generously gives us into a world that is hungry and thirsty for that heavenly bread and living water. God, pouring God’s self and life and love into us, changes us and changes the world through us into God’s people.

Christ IS the one in whom we live and move and have our being. So to have the identity of Christian means all this: People who ARE because God IS. As God’s divine actions flowed out of who God is, from our BE-ing in Christ flows our DO-ing in Christ, do-ing works that take on a holy and spiritual dimension.

In that divine relationship between being and doing,
God transforms us and the world.
Some might say that God is transforming the Episcopal Church even now, as General Convention elected Michael Curry to the office of Presiding Bishop yesterday, the first person of color to serve as PB in our denomination.

Three mission trips will be commissioned this morning. Missioners, you are not merely going to do. For God I AM WHO I AM sends you. You are doers who bear Christ, his love, his kindness and mercy, his humility with you. You are going to do good things because Christ loves the whole world and did good things. By allowing Christ to do good things in you and through you, by seeking Christ in those who you encounter, I pray that you and those you encounter will be blessed and changed.

I ask you to close your eyes and join me in prayer, using the words of
Ps. 46:10: Be still and know that I am God.
Be still and know that I am.
Be still and know.
Be still.
Be.
Amen.",Hilary Streever,"Richmond, VA",6/28/2015,
